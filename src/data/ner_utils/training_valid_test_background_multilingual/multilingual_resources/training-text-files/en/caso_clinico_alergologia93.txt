A 7-year-old patient with rejection of egg since its introduction, and habonosis lesions, dysphonia and bronchospasm after its ingestion, who was diagnosed with egg allergy after presenting an anaphylactic reaction after eating potato omelette. He had positive serum IgE and skin prick for egg fractions, more marked for egg white than for egg yolk (IgE white 32 kU/L, yolk 10.90 kU/L, OVB 1.18 kU/L, OVM 1.76 kU/L). Gradually, the specific IgE levels increased markedly to >100 kU/L for all egg fractions with a skin prick with a greater reaction for yolk than for white (white 10x7mm; yolk 20x10mm). In the last few months she has experienced diffuse abdominal discomfort 10-30 minutes after ingestion of chicken meat, which she previously tolerated, with specific IgE >100 kU/L for chicken whey protein and 34.7 kU/L for chicken meat. He had no contact with poultry and reported no symptoms with feathers despite being sensitised.
