In view of the results obtained, antiretroviral treatment (ART) was started with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (200mg/245mg; 1-0-0) associated with Raltegravir (400mg; 1-0-1). In addition, prophylactic Sulfamethoxazole/ Trimethoprim (800/160mg) one tablet three days a week and Fluconazole (100mg; 1-0-0) for one week. In addition, upon evidence of positive serology for syphilis, Penicillin G Benzathine 2.4 MU IM is prescribed once a week for a total of three doses. At that time, the Tropical Medicine Unit was consulted and recommended treatment with Ivermectin, which the patient refused due to his polymedication. In April, one month after starting ART, the patient consulted for a pruritic rash of 48 hours' duration, predominantly on the trunk. A blood test was performed in which all haemogram and biochemistry parameters were within normal ranges. CV of 1.7 Log and total CD4 count of 220/mm3 (10%). Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim prophylaxis was discontinued and antihistamines were prescribed. On the same day, the patient attended a Cardiology check-up and Ivabradine was withdrawn. After two weeks of symptomatic treatment, the skin lesions disappeared after two weeks. In May, the patient consulted again due to the sudden appearance of papular, erythematous and pruritic lesions, with a tendency to coalesce, which disappeared with acupressure and affected the groin, buttocks, dorsal region and upper and lower limbs. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are spared and he refuses to take any new drugs, food or risky substances. He is not in contact with domestic animals. He was treated with methylprednisolone 40 mg IM in a single dose and hydroxyzine, with complete disappearance of the lesions within 24 hours.

Urgent laboratory tests showed eosinophils of 160/μL and persistent elevation of transaminases (ALT 76 IU/l, AST 59 IU/l). The urine test was normal and a repeat chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary pseudonodules that were not visible in the previous examination. In view of the radiographic findings, a chest CT scan was performed, confirming the presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of an inflammatory vs. infectious nature.

At this time the patient was asymptomatic from the respiratory and gastrointestinal point of view. It was decided to maintain the same ART, start Ivermectin and continue the study by requesting the following tests. Sputum study:
- Ziehl-auramine stain: absence of BAAR.
- Culture of mycobacteria and regional fungi: Negative.
Serology for Aspergillus, cryptococcal antigen, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, and Blastomyces: Negative. Long incubation blood cultures: Negative. New PPD and PCR tuberculosis: Negative. Strongyloides IgG serology (ELISA): Positive. Control chest X-ray at 10 days: bilateral pseudonodular opacities that have decreased both in number and size and are less distinct compared to the previous study.

Evolution
This is a patient with late HIV infection, naïve and presenting with subacute diarrhoea with subsequent onset of skin rash. HIV infection: he had a viral load of 5 log and a CD4+ cell count of around 10%. It was therefore decided to start the aforementioned ART in accordance with the indications of the GeSIDA consensus document and taking into account the rest of the patient's medication, so that it is a regimen without drug interactions. The viral load after one month of treatment is practically undetectable. Subacute diarrhoea: during follow-up in the clinic, he reported a slight temporary improvement in stool consistency. Among the possible causes of diarrhoea in HIV patients, diarrhoea caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and neoplasms must be ruled out. For this reason, a thorough serological and stool examination is performed, ruling out infection by the main pathogens.

In the case presented here, it was not possible to perform an endoscopic study due to the patient's explicit refusal. Skin rash: the most important thing in the aetiological diagnosis of the rash is to rule out whether it is an opportunistic infectious process or a pharmacological reaction. Opportunistic infection is ruled out after the results of the complementary study. Likewise, it does not seem likely that it is a secondary process to the taking of drugs, as the anamnesis does not show any temporal sequence between the introduction or withdrawal of the drugs. Furthermore, a study of possible drug interactions was carried out and these were also rejected as a possible aetiology. Finally, it could be a skin condition in the context of the immune reconstitution process, although it is true that the rash associated with this process does not usually present urticariform characteristics. Pulmonary nodules: in the presence of such nodules, it is essential to rule out tumour pathology. The patient described here does not present constitutional symptoms or B symptoms. There are no skin lesions or adenopathies. Furthermore, the pulmonary images are in remission, so it seems logical to consider an infectious or inflammatory aetiology. Infectious causes include fungal, parasitic and mycobacterial causes. All of them have negative results in the complementary study. Thus, the presence of these involutional pseudonodules could be justified by the proinflammatory cascade that occurs in HIV patients when starting ART. However, it is noteworthy that the complementary study showed positive IgG against Strongyloides. Strongyloidiasis is endemic in countries with tropical or subtropical climates, acute infection is generally asymptomatic and has a tendency to become chronic. In HIV patients there is a risk of extraintestinal dissemination leading to hyperinfestation syndrome, especially when the CD4+ T-cell count is less than 200 cells/mm3. Disseminated forms often present without eosinophilia (a sign of severity and poor prognosis) and when symptoms are present, they are usually sporadic and of long duration. The most common symptoms include diarrhoea and malabsorption, cough and pruritus. The intensity of these symptoms is proportional to the number of parasites. The most commonly used method to confirm the diagnosis is the identification of larvae in faeces, sputum and tissues, although sometimes the helminth is not visualised. Therefore, multiple serial studies on agar cultures or separation of larvae by Baermann's method are required, the more often and consecutively the tests are repeated, the higher the cost-effectiveness of both tests. Increased IgG specific antibodies are found in cases of strongyloidiasis with or without immunosuppression, lack protective capacity for dissemination and are not indicators of severity. However, their identification is useful for diagnosis and their sensitivity can be as high as 97%. The patient does not currently present with clinical signs or abnormalities in the complementary tests compatible with a Strongyloides hyperinfestation syndrome. However, due to his epidemiological and medical history, and in view of the clinical and serological findings compatible with strongyloidiasis, it was decided to start treatment for the infection with Ivermectin, and improvement was observed.

Clinical judgement
- Late infection by HIV type 1 subtype B stage B3:
- Diarrhoea subacute and cutaneousrash in relation to Strongyloides infection.
- Pulmonary nodules in the context of immune reconstitution syndrome.
- Oral candidiasis. Secondary syphilis. Herpes zoster.
- Mild hepatitis. Past HBV hepatitis.
- STEMI Killip-I type acute myocardial infarction due to thrombotic occlusion of the anterior descending artery treated by drug-eluting stent implantation.
