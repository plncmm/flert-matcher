A 43-year-old man with no previous history, referred from Ophthalmology for bilateral vitritis of probable infectious aetiology. He reported weight loss for a year without asthenia or anorexia and self-limited catarrhal symptoms a week earlier. She reported risky sexual relations 6 months earlier.
Physical examination revealed a rash on the trunk and palmoplantar lesions suggestive of syphilitic gummas, with no palpable lymphadenopathy and the rest of the examination was normal.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests: biochemistry, haemogram, coagulation and venous gases normal.
- Chest X-ray: normal.
- ECG: normal.
Given the suspicion of infectious vitritis and the patient's skin lesions, the first diagnostic suspicion was syphilis with ocular involvement, so we requested serology, which was positive (RPR: positive, titre 1/256, HAART: positive). Once the diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed, we proceeded to rule out neurological involvement by CT scan of the brain (normal) and CSF measurement, which was negative. We requested the rest of the serologies (EBV, CMV, Toxoplasma, HAV, HCV and HDV negative; HIV positive; HBV HBsAG positive, total anti-HBc positive, IgM anti-HBcore negative, Ag HBe positive, Anti HBe negative).
With the definitive diagnosis of vitritis secondary to ocular syphilis and HIV stage C3-HBV co-infection, the next step was to request mantoux (negative), an HIV test and a CT scan of the thorax-abdomen-pelvis to rule out other secondary involvement (signs of chronic liver disease with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly). HIV study: Viral load: 773,556 copies/mL. Resistance test: V108I (possible resistance to neviparin). Lymphocyte subpopulations: CD4 152, CD8 796, CD4/CD8 0.19. HLA B5721 negative.
