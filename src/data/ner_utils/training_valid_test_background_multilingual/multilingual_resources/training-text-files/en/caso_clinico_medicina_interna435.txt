A 44-year-old man with no known drug allergies or any other history of interest except that for the last month he had been suffering from episodes of epigastralgia and his primary care doctor requested a breath test, which was positive. She has been on eradication treatment for H. pylori for two days. She consulted the emergency department for asthenia and bradypsychia of one week's duration and two episodes of dysarthria lasting 5-10 minutes. She reported no fever or other accompanying symptoms.
On physical examination, he was conscious and oriented in all three spheres, in good general condition, cardiopulmonary auscultation without findings, as well as abdominal, lower limb and neurological examination. Laboratory tests showed: creatinine 1.38 mg/dL, haemoglobin 8.9 g/dL, platelets 9000/uL, leukocytes 7200/uL and neutrophils 71.2%. ECG and chest X-ray with no apparent findings.
The patient was admitted and corticosteroid treatment was started with bicytopenia under study (anaemia and thrombopenia) and acute renal failure. Laboratory tests on the ward showed total bilirubin 1.61 mg/dl, indirect bilirubin 1.43 mg/dl, haptoglobin <6 g/L, LDH 1333 u/L, reticulocytes 110000/uL, D-dimer 2365 ng/ml and negative direct Coombs' test. Peripheral blood smear showed 8 to 10 schistocytes per field (see attached image).
Given the findings of elevated LDH, elevated total bilirubin at the expense of indirect bilirubin, very low haptoglobin, high reticulocytes and negative direct Coombs' test, a diagnosis of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia was made. In addition to the above, the elevated creatinine level, which had not been present previously, and the neurological symptoms (bradypsychia and episodes of dysarthria) led to a case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Our referral hospital was contacted for transfer and initiation of treatment with plasmapheresis.
