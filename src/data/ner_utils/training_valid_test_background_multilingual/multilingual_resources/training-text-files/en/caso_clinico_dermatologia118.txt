Anamnesis and physical examination
A 74-year-old man from a rural area of Italy who was on holiday in Spain, with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and revascularised acute coronary syndrome. He consulted the general emergency department for a 4-day history of myalgia predominantly in the lower extremities together with intermittent fever of up to 39°C with bacteraemic symptoms, asthenia and hyporexia. In addition, he presented a maculopapular rash with non-pruritic palmoplantar involvement. A detailed physical examination revealed a crusted left pretibial lesion with perilesional erythema. No other associated symptoms. She denied risky sexual contact. After treatment with paracetamol he remained symptomatic.

Complementary examinations
Laboratory tests showed abnormal liver function tests AST 88 U/L, ALT 74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 99 U/L, GGT 95 U/L with bilirubin of 10 μmol/L and CRP 305 mg/L without leukocytosis, but with plateletopenia of 60x10 E9/L. Coagulation within normal limits. Blood cultures were negative on two occasions. Given the epidemiological context and the findings on physical examination, given the suspicion of rickettsiasis, serology for Rickettsia conorii was requested, with a first determination that was negative. Serologies for brucellosis, coxiella, HIV-1, HIV-2 and Treponema pallidum were negative. Subsequently seroconversion for Rickettsia conorii was confirmed with specific IgG 1/2560.

Diagnosis
Based on these findings a diagnosis of Mediterranean button fever (MBF) was made.

Treatment and course
Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline 100 mg/12 h was started and the patient was admitted for follow-up. After 48 h the fever disappeared and the intensity of the rash decreased.
The patient completed 21 days of treatment and his laboratory parameters returned to normal. He returned to Italy afebrile, with remission of the rash but persistence in the left lower extremity of the inoculation site.
