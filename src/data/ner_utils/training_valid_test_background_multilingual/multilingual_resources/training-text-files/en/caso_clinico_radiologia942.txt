Male, 41 years old.
Hepatitis C carrier.
History of polysubstance abuse, smoking, marijuana and intravenous drug use.
Admitted to hospital for treatment of osteomyelitis due to group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus.
Days after admission, sudden dyspnoea, tachycardia. CT scan was requested to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism, which was ruled out.

Portable chest X-ray in frontal projection, mnip reconstruction, showing diffuse pulmonary nodules, prominence of the trunk of the pulmonary artery, reflecting pulmonary hypertension. Incidentally, as an anatomical variant, cystic fissure of the azygos vein. 

Axillary computed tomography slices showing multiple, bilateral, diffusely distributed central lobular micronodules, with no apex-to-basal gradient, no subpleural or peribronchovascular predominance.

Focussed magnification to better represent the multiple, bilateral, central-lobular micronodules. Absence of ground-glass areas and signs of fibrosis. The image shows that the diameter of the segmental arteries is larger than the diameter of the accompanying bronchus, a sign of pulmonary hypertension.

Signs of pulmonary hypertension. The diameter of the pulmonary artery trunk is increased, measuring 41mm. Increased right ventricular volume, with bulging of the interventricular septum to the left, with trabeculations of the right ventricular wall, which are also signs of overload of the right chambers.

Final Diagnosis
Thalcosis
