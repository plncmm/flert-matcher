We present the case of a 73-year-old man with a skin lesion on his back attributed to a sting, 10 days earlier, while working in an orchard in the community of Madrid in August. A few days later he presented with fever of up to 39Â°C and new skin lesions on the trunk and extremities, with no response to treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. On examination she presented black eschar on the left dorsal lumbar region and an erythematous papular rash on the trunk and extremities. The rest of the examination was normal. Blood tests revealed no findings of interest. With clinical suspicion of rickettsiosis, blood was drawn for serology and samples of the papular rash were taken for histological examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis at the reference laboratory. Treatment was prescribed with oral doxycycline (100mg/day for 7 days) with progressive improvement until complete resolution without sequelae. Acute phase serology by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) showed low titres of immunoglobulin (Ig) G against Rickettsia conorii, and negative IgM. A new serology performed 4 weeks later showed no change. Skin biopsy showed a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and vasculitis phenomena. PCR study of the skin biopsy detected the presence of Rickettsia sibirica mongolotimonae.

We describe a new case of Rickettsiosis due to Rickettsia sibirica mongolotimonae in Spain, with the peculiarity that the diagnosis was made by PCR in skin biopsy of the exanthema and not of the inoculation eschar.
