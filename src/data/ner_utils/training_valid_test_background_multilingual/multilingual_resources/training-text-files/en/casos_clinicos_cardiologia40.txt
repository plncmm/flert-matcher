A 59-year-old male with a high fever (39o) of 2 days' evolution and an episode of convulsive crisis. He appears stuporous.

BP 97/80 mmHg. Fc 132 bpm. SatO2 95%. Fr 22 rpm. Ta 34,2oC.

Meets criteria of SEPSIS SERIOUS: Ta34,2o. Acute renal failure (Creatinine 2,2); elevated PCT and CRP (bacterial infection); Hypotension (97/80) with signs of poor perfusion (cold and sweaty), Metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), elevated lactate (hypoperfusion); Oligoanuria; very striking Plateletopenia (16. 000); Tachycardia (AF at 132 x ́), Tachypnoea at 26 x ́(low pCO2). The FOCO is unknown.

Let's go in parts:

1) Sepsis-induced hypotension: 2,000 cc of Physiological Serum is administered and later in ICU 1,500 cc SF. -> Maintain BP 105/75

2) Atrial fibrillation at 130 x ́ -> IV AMIODARONE .... -> Sinus rhythm.

3) Antibiotic? After 2 blood cultures -> MEROPENEM IV, -> CLOXACILLIN + CEFOTAXIME + CYPROFLOXACIN was chosen in ICU. -> and subsequently: CLOXACILLIN + DAPTOMYCIN -> currently CLOXACILLIN + GENTAMYCIN.

4) Convulsive crisis that recurred after a few hours. CT scan: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE, probably related to plateletopenia or mycotic (= infectious) aneurysm -> treatment with IV LEVETIRACETAM is started.

5) Plateletopenia. -> Hematology consultation: "does not meet criteria for TTP, HIT, or Haemophagocytic Syndrome; ITP versus vasculitis is not ruled out in addition to the septic picture". Treatment was started with corticosteroids + platelet perfusion: a daily pool.

6) Search for FOCO: transthoracic echocardiogram was performed: NO warts were visualised.

7) Blood cultures positive for STAPHILOCOCCUS AUREUS (sensitive to methicillin).

8) Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed: an image of VERRUGE in the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was visualised.

9) Consultation with Cardiovascular Surgery: surgical treatment was ruled out at the present time due to SAH. Reassessment after 6 weeks.

10) Appearance of purpuric lesions (ecchymotic) of probable embolic origin on the tips of the fingers and soles of the feet.

After a week in ICU, she remained stable. Transferred to the ward.

DIAGNOSTIC JUDGEMENT:

- MITRAL ENDOCARDITIS on valve with myxomatous degeneration due to S. AUREUS.

- SEVERE SEPSIS with RENAL FAILURE (corrected on discharge). SEVERE PLATELETOPENIA.

- SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE. generalised EPILEPTIC CRISIS.

- ACxFA (reverted to sinus rhythm).

Commentary:
Staphylococcus aureus: S.Aureus lives on human skin -> causes skin infections: folliculitis, impetigo, skin abscesses, furunculosis, mastitis, cellulitis, wound infection...(also surgical wounds)....
