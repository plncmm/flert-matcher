A 35 year old man came to the emergency department for abdominal pain, vomiting and general malaise. Analyses showed CRP 1.34 mg/dl and leucocytes 14,400.

Chest X-ray showed bilateral nodular opacities predominantly in the upper lobes. The abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed an irregular parietal thickening in the proximal ileum with obstruction, without lymphadenopathy. There are isolated pulmonary nodules with irregular borders in the lung bases. Small bowel neoplasia with pulmonary metastases is reported. At the time of diagnosis the tests were unknown. Urgent surgery was performed with resection of a non-tumourous mass in the proximal ileum with anatomopathological findings of granulomatous enteritis. A few days later, a CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules, predominantly in the upper lobes, with irregular borders, some of them cavitated, and pulmonary areas with a tree-shaped pattern. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed M. tubercolysis with the final diagnosis of disseminated pulmonary and gastrointestinal tuberculosis.
