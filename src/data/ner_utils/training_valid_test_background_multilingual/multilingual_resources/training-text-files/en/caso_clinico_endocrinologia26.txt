A 29-year-old man consulted for fever and intense odynophagia. On physical examination he was tachycardic at 136 bpm, temperature 39 oC; at the cervical level there was an increase in the left thyroid volume with a palpable, fluctuating mass. Blood tests showed leukocytosis of 11,600/Î¼L (Neu 80.4%), fibrinogen > 1,000 mg/dL, CRP 18.7 mg/dL. Thyroid profile compatible with thyrotoxicosis with TSH 0.07 mIU/L (0.55-4.78) and T4L 4.2 ng/dL (0.8-1.8). Blood cultures were negative. Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and laryngoscopy were normal. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy was started on suspicion of acute infectious thyroiditis. Cervical ultrasound showed a left thyroid abscess with reactive locoregional lymph nodes. A neck CT scan showed another retropharyngeal collection. The thyroid scan showed no visualisation of the left hemithyroid. In view of these findings, the ENT department was consulted and it was decided to drain both abscesses by cervicotomy. Purulent material with abundant leukocytes was obtained, isolating Streptococcus viridans, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella sp, Bacteroides vulgatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Slackia exigua and Peptostreptococcus micros. HIV negative. Negative anti-TPO, anti-TG and anti-TSH antibodies. Normalisation of the thyroid profile after resolution of the acute episode, TSH 3.71 mIU/L, free T4 0.9 ng/dl and free T3 2.64 pg/ml (2.3-4.2). Barium oesophagogram showed a left pyriform sinus fistula.
