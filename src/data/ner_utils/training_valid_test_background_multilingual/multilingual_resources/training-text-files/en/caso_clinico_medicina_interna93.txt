A 42 year old man with no personal history of interest, who started a study due to the appearance of blood tests compatible with dissociated cholestasis; during the clinical interview the patient did not report any symptoms by organs or apparatus of interest. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed space-occupying lesions in the liver and spleen, and the study was completed with a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showing multiple small hypodense lesions in both the liver and spleen, with no adenopathy in any of the compartments studied. The thoracoabdominal CT scan showed bilateral laterocervical lymphadenopathies of less than 1 cm, with no evidence of other mediastinal or abdominal lymphadenopathies. The pulmonary pattern showed no lesions, and there were multiple small hypodense lesions in the spleen and liver suggestive of metastasis. The study was completed with abdominal MRI to better define the lesions, with the same results. A complete blood test was performed with negative autoimmunity (ANA and AMA) and negative serology for HBV-HCV-HIV-Brucella-Ricekttsia-Coxiella burnnetii-Treponema Pallidum. A liver biopsy of the lesion described with the findings of granulomas that did not show caseous necrosis, a Ziehl Neelsen histochemical technique to detect acid fast bacilli was negative as well as the PCR technique and culture for TB; The final result was granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis.
