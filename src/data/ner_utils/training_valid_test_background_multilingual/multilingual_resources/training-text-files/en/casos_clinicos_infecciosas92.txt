This is a 71-year-old man, with no drug allergies, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and anxious-depressive syndrome. He had undergone surgery for an intertrochanteric fracture of the left hip, by implanting a proximal femoral nail. He was receiving daily treatment with metformin 850 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, venlafaxine 75 mg, lormetazepam 2 mg and tranxilium 5 mg. He consulted the emergency department for approximately two months of low-grade febrile episodes accompanied by fluctuations in the level of consciousness, bradypsychia, headache, vomiting, weakness in both lower limbs and urinary incontinence, which self-limited over the course of one or two days and then recurred. He denied symptoms in other areas. Approximately one year earlier, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt valve had been successfully implanted for normotensive hydrocephalus.
He had been admitted on two occasions for febrile syndromes associated with neurological symptoms. On the first occasion, he presented with a meningeal syndrome associated with fever and diarrhoea of four days' evolution, where, after obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with high cellularity (180 cells/mm3; (75% N, 25% L), no red blood cells, glucose 76 mg/dl, protein 65 mg/dl, normal ADA and negative xanthochromia, empirical antibiotic therapy was started with ampicillin, ceftriaxone and vancomycin, which was discontinued after 48 hours following negative culture and PCR for meningotrophic germs (E. coli, H. influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, human herpes 6, human parechovirus, Cryptococcus neoformans) in CSF. Given the patient's stability and clinical improvement, he was discharged after 7 days with a diagnosis of meningeal syndrome of an unidentified aetiology in the context of gastroenteritis. In the following admission two months later and 21 days before the current consultation, he was assessed again for a febrile syndrome with the same neurological symptoms, where after obtaining a CSF with 1 leukocyte/mm3, 1 haemocyte/mm3, glucose 76 mg/dl, protein 15.9 mg/dl, he was admitted on suspicion of chronic valve dysfunction. No antibiotic therapy was initially prescribed pending CSF cultures, blood cultures and urine culture, and a diagnosis was finally made of an upper urinary tract infection complicated by multisensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment was started with ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours, returning the patient to his baseline situation, and he was discharged with ciprofloxacin 750 mg every 12 hours for 10 days.

On physical examination at the current visit, the patient was afebrile, well hydrated and perfused, conscious, alert although slightly bradypsychic, with isochoric pupils and no cranial nerve involvement. Strength and sensitivity were preserved without asymmetry, without meningeal signs, with normal gait. Cardiopulmonary auscultation, as well as the abdomen and extremities showed no pathological alterations on examination.

The initial complementary tests showed:
- Blood count: haemoglobin 16.3 g/dl, leukocytes 13,000/mm3, with a predominance of neutrophils 80% and 402,000/mm3 platelets. Coagulation normal. Glucose 118 mg/dl, creatinine 0.5 mg/dl, sodium 128 mEq/l, potassium 4 mEq/l, C-reactive protein 5 mg/l.
- Chest X-ray without pathological findings.
- Cranial CT scan: DVP valve with right frontal entrance and distal end in III ventricle. Dilatation of the ventricular system, similar to previous studies with no data of complications.

Blood and urine cultures were taken. After being assessed by neurosurgery, a lumbar puncture was performed and a clear CSF was obtained with 1 leucocyte per field, glucose 71 mg/dl and proteins in range, which was sent to the microbiology laboratory for Gram staining and culture. The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department with a provisional diagnosis of "recurrent febrile syndrome associated with health care in a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt". Because of suspected valve dysfunction of non-infectious aetiology, empirical antibiotic therapy was not indicated.

Differential diagnosis
In a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt with recurrent clinical symptoms of headache, altered level of consciousness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, weakness of limbs and urinary incontinence, we must first consider the different causes that may underlie a dysfunction of the device, defined as a malfunction of the shunt system with partial or complete reduction of CSF flow through it, and clinically presenting with symptoms of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) secondary to obstruction or disconnection at some point in the system.

Ventriculoperitoneal obstruction: This is the most common cause of valve dysfunction and should be suspected especially in cases of late presentation, i.e. beyond the first fifteen days after implantation.
2. PVD infection: This is the second most common cause and is described in approximately 8-15% of patients. It usually presents early, in contrast to our case, and should be considered in the presence of symptoms suggestive of meningitis: fever, meningismus, stiff neck, headache, nausea and vomiting, irritability and decreased level of consciousness. Not forgetting that if the infection is located at the distal catheter, it may present with abdominal and/or cardiocirculatory symptoms.
Ventriculitis: This may be primary or secondary to meningitis, brain abscess, intraventricular haemorrhage or iatrogenic. When associated with intracranial devices such as DVP, it usually occurs within the first month of the procedure and may have subtle and progressive clinical signs of headache, altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, fever and neurological focality. The clinical picture may also be masked after courses of antibiotic therapy.
4. Mechanical failure of the PVD:
- Degradation and rupture of the system: usually occurs in the distal catheter and occurs years after implantation.
- Disconnection of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, usually occurs early after implantation.
- Migration of the proximal or distal ends of the system or malposition. CSF hyperdrainage syndromes. - Obstruction of the ventricular end of the shunt.
- Symptomatic ventricular collapse (slit ventricle syndrome).
- Subdural haematoma.
- Isolated fourth ventricle These are uncommon as devices are already commercially available that minimise this risk and are generally not associated with fever.
6. Abdominal pseudocyst formation. Predominantly abdominal symptoms initially, followed by neurological symptoms, which may or may not be accompanied by fever.

In addition to the above, in the case we present, causes unrelated to the dysfunction of the system could be considered, which are listed below:
1. Infections localised outside the central nervous system, in which case, the neurological symptoms would be secondary to the encephalopathy accompanying a systemic picture.
2. Infections of the central nervous system unrelated to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt system 
- Chronic meningitis: defined as lasting more than four weeks. It is a rare entity, with an insidious course and its origin may be due to infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic causes, with the aetiology remaining unidentified in up to one third of cases.
- Acute meningitis of haematogenous origin.

Evolution
During his stay on the ward the patient persisted with an oscillating level of consciousness, bradypsychia, disorientation and sustained febrile peaks with persistent leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein in control tests, repeatedly negative blood cultures, negative urine culture and negative serology for Brucella spp, Coxiella spp and Rickettsia spp. A thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested, showing a left segmental basal atelectasis, adjacent to the descending thoracic aorta with no other findings. A transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out data suggestive of infective endocarditis. Finally, a PET-CT scan was requested to rule out an occult septic focus, showing a pathological uptake in the last 10 cm of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, in its intraperitoneal trajectory, suggestive of infection. In view of these findings, and after consultation with Neurosurgery, it was decided to completely remove the system with CSF and distal catheter tip cultures, and Microbiology was requested to investigate the presence of slow-growing microorganisms. After this, empirical antibiotic therapy was started with vancomycin 1g IV/12h and meropenem 2g iv/8h pending definitive results. The culture of the explanted material isolated Propionibacterium acnes (currently Cutibacterium acnes) sensitive to beta-lactams, and antibiotic treatment was simplified to amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours, which was maintained for four weeks after removal of the system, with complete resolution of the clinical picture.

Definitive diagnosis
Infection of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt device by Propionibacterium acnes (now Cutibacterium acnes).
