We present the case of a 28-year-old Spanish male, institutionalised in prison since December 2009 and with no history of interest except for bronchial asthma being treated with inhaled bronchodilators. Prior to his admission to prison, he lived in the north-east of Brazil, in the state of Cear√°, from March 2008 to August 2009, in suburban areas ("favelas"). During his stay in Brazil, he reports drinking tap water and fresh salads and walking barefoot in mud. He also reports suffering from a self-limited diarrhoea of unclear origin. Twelve months after his admission to prison, he began to suffer from a marked general syndrome with progressive asthenia and a weight loss of 10 kg, accompanied by dizziness, occasional headaches and dyspepsia. He presented two episodes of liquid diarrhoea, accompanied by abdominal pain and without the presence of pathological products. Examination revealed only a marked pallor of the skin and mucous membranes. Blood tests showed haemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, haematocrit 29.3%, mean corpuscular volume 65fL, leukocytes 10,900/mm3 (eosinophils 2,800/mm3), platelets 431,000/mm3. HIV, hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. He was referred for admission to his referral hospital, where complete biochemistry, including liver function tests and chest X-ray, showed no abnormalities. Stool parasite studies were performed on 3 consecutive samples by the etherformol concentration technique, showing the presence of uncinaria eggs. Strongyloides stercoralis serology was positive by ELISA with a titration of 0.6 optical density units. Treatment with albendazole 400 mg/12 hours (d.u.) and ivermectin 200 micrograms/kg/day on two consecutive days together with oral ferric sulphate was prescribed for 3 months.

After 3 months of treatment, recovery of all haematological parameters and negativation of both the coproparasitological analysis of intestinal parasites and serology for Strongiloydes stercoralis were observed.
