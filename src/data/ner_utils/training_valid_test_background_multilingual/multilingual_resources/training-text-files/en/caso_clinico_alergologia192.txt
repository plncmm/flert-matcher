A 4-month-old male infant attended the emergency department for an episode of cutaneous pallor, abundant vomiting and intense weakness that started 2 hours after eating gluten-free cereal porridge. Complete resolution of the symptoms with supportive measures and discharge 4 hours later.

Allergological study: Negative skin tests for corn, rice and prick-prick with the porridge involved, negative specific IgE for rice and corn. He was diagnosed with cereal enterocolitis.

No new episodes after withdrawal of gluten-free cereals except episode of abundant vomiting after ingestion of dairy products with corn starch as thickener on two occasions.
At 9 months of age, episode of similar characteristics to the one described 3 hours after ingestion of puree with rooster, again requiring emergency care. Previously, he had presented small amounts of vomiting related to the ingestion of small amounts of other fish.

Skin tests and fish-specific IgE were negative.

During the follow-up, tolerance to cereals with gluten and to the rest of the foods introduced in the food diversification was confirmed, and he was diagnosed with non-IgE-mediated allergy to gluten-free cereals and fish.

We present a case of enterocolitis induced by gluten-free cereals and fish with proven tolerance to gluten-containing cereals.
