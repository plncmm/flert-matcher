Twelve year old boy followed in consultation since the age of four for poorly controlled asthma with associated GER. Prick test and specific IgE negative for pneumoallergens until the age of twelve, when they were positive for olive and grasses.

From the age of ten, worsening of asthma and GER, associated with dysphagia for solids. Also, some episode of facial reaction after ingestion of food with traces of milk. Prick test and specific IgE for casein 6x6mm and 4.80 KU/L respectively.

The patient was referred to paediatric gastroenterology with suspicion of eosinophilic oesophagitis, which was confirmed (35 eosinophils/field in oesophageal biopsies). Dairy products were completely withdrawn and Omeprazole and swallowed Budesonide were prescribed, with normalisation of the endoscopy, and treatment could be withdrawn at 14 months.

After a strict dairy-free diet, he was asymptomatic from the digestive point of view and his asthma improved. At twelve years of age urticaria after accidental ingestion of cooked ham (with traces of milk) and at thirteen years of age an anaphylactic reaction after accidental ingestion of cow's milk.
