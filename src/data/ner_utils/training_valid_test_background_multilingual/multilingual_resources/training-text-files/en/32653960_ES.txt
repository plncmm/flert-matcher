A 29-year-old woman with a history of gastric bypass a year earlier and a family history of diabetes (aunts with type 2 diabetes; a cousin with type 1 diabetes diagnosed at 7 years of age). She presented two months earlier (20 March 2020) with severe asthenia, fever, stiffness and dyspnoea. She then presented with anosmia and ageusia, with anorexia (25 March). She was admitted to the emergency department and symptomatic treatment was started for suspected COVID-19 infection and she was discharged (blood glucose was normal). Two weeks later, she was symptom-free. However, one month after her first COVID-19 symptoms (24 April), she presented with acute polyuria-polydipsia. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed (12 May) with a blood glucose of 3.7 g/l (20.5 mmol/l), non-significant ketosis (0.7 mmol/l) and normal bicarbonate value (26 mmol/l). The HbA1c value was 1.8% (105 mmol/mol). His weight was 120 kg before gastric bypass and 65 kg before COVID-19 and 57 kg (BMI 21.5kg/m2) at the time of diagnosis of diabetes. The diabetes required insulin immediately, and was treated with a basal bolus regimen. He had no metabolic comorbidities and markers were normal (no hypertension, negative C-reactive protein (< 0.6mg/l, Hdlc 0.46g/l, Ldlc 0.43g/l, triglycerides 0.42g/l, normal ALT, AST, gGT and ferritin, no hepatic steatosis on CT). Lipase and TSH values were normal; pancreatic CT was normal. C-peptide was low at 0.07 pmol/ml (normal values between 0.37 and 1.47). Antibodies against pancreatic beta cells were tested and, finally, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 autoantibodies (GAD-65A, 93 IU/ml, N < 17) were positive for immune type 1 diabetes, while anti-tyrosine phosphatase IA2 and anti-zinc transporter-8 antibodies were negative.
SARS-CoV-2 serology was positive, confirming COVID-19 infection.
