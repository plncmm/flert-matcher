A 42-year-old man, recently diagnosed with metastatic clear cell sarcomatoid renal sarcomatoid carcinoma, was hospitalised with fever, pain management for symptomatic bone metastases and for first-line systemic treatment decisions. The patient had no other history. He initially presented with a fever of 39.0°C on 12 March 2020, for which he received ceftriaxone outside our centre. On day 6, he presented with mild cough and fever (38.3°C), which prompted a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; the result was positive. The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 ward of our hospital and closely monitored. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities associated with COVID-19 (figure 1). On D7 he was started on antiviral therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir (400mg/100mg orally), which was maintained for 5 days, according to local guidelines. On day 8, sudden dyspnoea and a drop in saturation necessitated increasing oxygen to 6 l/min, without the need for mechanical ventilation. He was given two doses of tocilizumab, with 8 mg/kg i.v. in each dose, 8 hours apart, with good tolerance. He then showed clinical improvement, becoming afebrile rapidly and with decreasing oxygen consumption, which was completely withdrawn on day 12. A chest CT scan on day 12 confirmed the improvement showing partial regression of pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities. C-reactive protein, an indirect marker of cytokine release, decreased from 225 mg/L to 33 mg/L in 4 days (figure 1). After tocilizumab administration, no relevant changes in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations were observed and the percentage of CD4 + CD25 + lymphocytes was high, before and after tocilizumab. Finally, the patient fully recovered from the symptoms of COVID-19.
