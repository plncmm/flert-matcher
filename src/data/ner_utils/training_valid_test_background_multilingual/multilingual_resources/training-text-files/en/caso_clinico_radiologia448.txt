68-year-old woman. She came to the emergency department with dyspnoea and fever of three days' evolution. Previously a week of general malaise with vomiting. Laboratory tests showed sepsis. An abdominopelvic CT scan after contrast shows reticulation adjacent to the head and uncinate process of the pancreas, suggestive of pancreatitis. In the liver, there are numerous hypodense images in both hepatic lobes, with a rounded morphology and a discreetly arrachymal arrangement, without contrast uptake. There was also partial thrombosis of the main portal vein, superior mesenteric vein and middle hepatic vein.

The diagnosis of pylephlebitis with hepatic abscesses of probable pancreatic origin was proposed, with metastasis of unknown origin as a less likely differential diagnosis. After antibiotic therapy, in successive controls the number and size of the liver abscesses decreased, as well as the images of thrombosis, confirming the suspicion of an infectious condition.
