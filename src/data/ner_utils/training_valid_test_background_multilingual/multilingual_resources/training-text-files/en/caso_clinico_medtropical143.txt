A 42 year old male traveller from Catalonia who made a 6 month trip (first half of 2001) to South America. He started his trip in the south of Argentina, then in Chile and Bolivia, ending with a month and a half in the Peruvian Amazon, specifically in Iquitos. He came to the clinic with a three-week history of symptoms, which began in Iquitos and for which he had been taking antibiotics (cloxacillin) for a week. Physical examination revealed two forunculous lesions in the dorsal region. Red lumps 0.5 cm in diameter, with a central orifice, which when pressed ooze serous fluid and cause stabbing pain and pruritus. The rest of the examination was normal.

In the case in question, from the first day of the visit until the day of the extraction, antibiotic treatment was maintained and, under the suspicion of myiasis, the orifice was occluded daily with vaseline to provoke the larvae to come out. Finally, after 10 days, and given the impossibility of the natural exit of the larva, we proceeded under local anaesthesia and with a small incision in the entrance orifice to the natural extraction of the larva, alive, being identified as Dermatoba hominis.
