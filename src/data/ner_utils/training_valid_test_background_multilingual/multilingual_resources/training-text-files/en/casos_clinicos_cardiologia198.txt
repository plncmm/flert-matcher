A 72-year-old man with an aortic bioprosthesis implanted in 2010 was diagnosed with prosthetic endocarditis due to Enterococcus faecalis 5 years after the operation. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an abscess at the level of the mitroaortic junction, 11 mm in diameter, with a 9 mm vegetation attached to the ventricular side of the non-coronary leaflet.

A computed axial tomography (CT) scan revealed a large abscess with gas inside, at the level of the aortic root, extending into the right ventricular outflow tract. Gas bubbles were also present within the pulmonary artery trunk. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) confirmed the extension of the infection in both locations.

At surgery, the infected prosthesis was replaced with a cryopreserved aortic valve homograft, sutured subcoronary. Surgical samples were positive for the same microorganism isolated from the blood. No macroscopic involvement of the main pulmonary artery was found. The free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract was explored, and although it was compacted, its puncture did not yield any pathological product, ruling out frank collections at that level.

The postoperative period was uneventful. The control 18F-FDG PET/CT scan showed no evidence of residual gas or significant 18F-FDG uptake. Control blood cultures were similarly negative.
