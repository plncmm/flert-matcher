Nine-month-old infant from Vargas State, north of the Capital District, who developed acute myocarditis and the diagnosis was made post mortem when T. cruzi trypomastigotes were found in the myocardial biopsy. The mother reported finding a "chipo" (common name in Venezuela) in the child's cot a few weeks before the onset of symptoms, but did not associate it with the disease. In her middle-class house, in the foothills of the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range of the Venezuelan Central Coast, there was a storage room with a palm roof, where the reduvideos probably came from. When 82 people, predominantly children, living in this and neighbouring houses were examined, all were found to be negative for T. cruzi infection; however, 21 P.geniculatus were found, of which 13 were infected with T. cruzi.
