An 11 year old black female from Equatorial Guinea was admitted to our centre for a study due to fatigue, hepatomegaly and ascites. Echocardiography showed severe dilatation of the left atrium, normal systolic function and severe dilatation of the right chambers. Estimated pulmonary pressure due to tricuspid regurgitation was 100 mmHg. A haemodynamic study was performed, which confirmed a systemic pulmonary pressure with pulmonary resistances of 23 UW/m2, which were not modified with oxygen and nitric oxide. Complementary studies included a normal haemogram and positive stool cultures for Schistosoma intercalatum and S. haematobium.

The diagnosis was restrictive cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis.

Medical treatment with antiparasitic drugs, diuretics and systemic and pulmonary vasodilators was started, but no clear response was observed. During the course of the disease, she developed an episode of left hemiparesis secondary to cerebral thromboembolism in the context of an episode of atrial fibrillation.

Four years after diagnosis, she underwent a successful cardiopulmonary transplant.
