Male, 44 years old, from Morocco, smoker 1-2 cig/day. He works in gardening. No other personal or family history of interest. The patient was seen in the outpatient department of Internal Medicine for a condition of 2 weeks' evolution consisting of the presence of nodular, erythematous-violaceous facial lesions.
The patient was diagnosed with late onset HIV infection (CD4 60 uL, HIV load 317000 copies).
A biopsy of the lesions was performed and the result was non-specific. Kaposi's sarcoma vs. bacillary angiomatosis was suggested as a differential diagnosis.
Doxycycline 100 md/12 h vo was prescribed, with disappearance of the skin lesions a few days later.
Treatment was started with EGV/cobicistat, FTC, ABC (StribildÂ®).
After 10 days of treatment, the patient attended the emergency department for acute symptoms of general malaise, high fever, oligoanuria and hypotension. Laboratory tests showed a progressive increase in leukocytes and procalcitonin, with normal urine and chest X-ray. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without evident focus. PCR was positive for Bartonella henselae in a skin lesion biopsy.
A diagnosis of trench fever exacerbated by HAART-induced immune reconstitution was made.
IV gentamicin and high-dose corticosteroids were added. He progressed favourably and was discharged and continued to be followed up in the infectious diseases department.
Immune reconstitution syndrome should be suspected in patients with HIV infection who, after starting ART, develop "paradoxical" reactivation of opportunistic infections previously controlled with treatment.
The usual pathogens with which it is described are M. tuberculosis, MAI, CMV, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis and Herpes virus 8, but there are rarer cases associated with Bartonella such as ours.
