A 45-year-old man, of Nigerian origin, was admitted for weakness and lumbar pain radiating to the lower back in the form of cramps and bladder involvement due to RAO which required catheterisation. He had associated pruritic lesions of 2 months' evolution on the chest. No other associated symptoms. He had been diagnosed with HIV 20 days earlier at a nearby centre without starting ART or prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. He denied risky relationships, parenteral drug addiction and previous transfusions. Clinical examination revealed hyperpigmented papulonodular lesions with a cicatricial appearance on the chest and neurological deficit in MID (BM 0/5 in right tibialis anterior, 0/5 right plantar flexion, L5-S4 hypoaesthesia), symmetrical areflexia in MMII and inability to stand upright. An MRI revealed an intramedullary ring-reinforced lesion located at T12 level and brain CT did not show LOES. HIV was confirmed, and CD4 and CV cell counts were performed (CD4 41 and CV 54,653). Serology was extended to rule out opportunistic diseases of the nervous system including CMV, HTLV, HSV, LÃºes, Taenia Solium and Strongyloides, with negative results except for IgG for toxoplasma. CSF tests confirmed a positive PCR for toxoplasma and a CV of 3025 copies/ml of Epstein Barr virus. CSF cytology and flow cytometry were performed to rule out lymphoma, which was negative, concluding intramedullary toxoplasmosis in an HIV-positive patient. The skin lesions on the trunk were biopsied and found to be perforating folliculitis.

Evolution
In view of the results, anti-toxoplasma treatment was started together with antiretroviral therapy. After one week of treatment and initiation of RHB, the patient had significant improvement with partial recovery of motor balance and withdrawal of catheterisation without incident.
