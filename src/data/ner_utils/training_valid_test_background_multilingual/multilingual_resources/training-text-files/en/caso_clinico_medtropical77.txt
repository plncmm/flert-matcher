A 48-year-old diabetic woman from Bagua, Amazonas Region, Peru. She consulted for a lesion more than 10 years old that started in the middle area of the thumb. She presented with erythema, pruritus, desquamation, black spots and occasional pain in the distal region of the thumb. Chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea sp: Erythematous-squamous lesion; muriform cells at 400x magnification; dark green radiating colonies at 10 days incubation on Sabouraud agar; septate hyphae and elliptical conidia at 400x magnification.

Direct examination with 10% potassium hydroxide revealed the presence of muriform cells suggestive of chromoblastomycosis. In culture, 14 mm dark green radiating colonies were observed after 10 days of incubation and Fonsecaea sp. was identified by microculture and microscopy.

Complementary haematological studies showed a haematocrit 43.2%, haemoglobin 13.8 g/dL, leucocytes 7620 cells/mm3 and 4% eosinophils (305 cells/mm3). Additionally, serologies for Chagas, HIV and HTLV were negative.

The patient was treated with itraconazole 100 mg every 12 h for two months. However, a control culture showed viability of the fungus in the lesion. The patient discontinued further treatment and subsequent controls, which is why the evolution of the disease could not be observed.
