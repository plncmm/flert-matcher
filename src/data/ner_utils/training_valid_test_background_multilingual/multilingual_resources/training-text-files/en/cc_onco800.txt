Oncological history
Diagnosed in November 2011 with high-grade squamous cell carcinoma of the left vocal cord following dysphonia of two months' duration. A lesion was observed in the left vocal cord (CVI) with involvement of the anterior commissure and extension to the right vocal cord (CVD), and laser chordectomy was performed in the external centre. At that time, cT1bN0M0; pT1N0M0.
"First recurrence, local:
- In December 2012, he attended the emergency department for dysphonia, showing paralysis of the IVC and hypomobility of the CVD, and an urgent tracheostomy was performed. Presented to the committee, it was decided to perform intraoperative microlaryngoscopy with perioperative biopsies, which were positive for malignancy, so a total laryngectomy was performed on 11 January 2013. The pathology report highlights the presence of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, infiltrating 3.5 cm in the maximum axis, with invasion of the pyriform sinus, glottis and subglottic extension, as well as thyroid cartilage and extension to pre-tracheal soft tissues. There is perineural and vascular infiltration and the tracheal margin is free. Thus, it presents a local recurrence and is staged as rpT4NxM0.
- Treatment: adjuvant radiotherapy was carried out from 21/2/2013 to 6/5/2013, with a total dose of 66 gray (Gy) in the surgical bed and 50 Gy in the lymph node chains, using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
"Second recurrence, nodal:
- In January 2014, a control CT scan of the neck showed a poorly demarcated lesion in the right nodal level IV, and a FNA was performed on the lesion, which was positive for malignant cellularity. In March 2014, in this context, a right radical cervical emptying was performed, with positive results in 4 of 6 lymph nodes, extracapsular invasion in 2 nodes and perineural invasion.
- Treatment: concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) 40 mg/m2 weekly and a total dose of 66 Gy by IMRT, from 12/5/2014 to 23/6/2014, well tolerated.
"Third recurrence, unresectable.
- In March 2015, following suppuration in the peritracheostomy area, an ulcerated area was observed in this location, with computed tomography (CT) showing the presence of a left peritracheostomy tumour recurrence, with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and contraction with the left thyroid lobe and trachea. The positron emission tomography (PET-CT) extension study was negative. A biopsy was performed showing the presence of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- Treatment: from 7/4/2015 to 13/7/2015 she underwent 5 cycles of carboplatin-fluorouracil (5-FU)-cetuximab, with the best response being stable disease after 3 cycles.
Current disease
The patient attended the Medical Oncology outpatient clinic in July 2015, and the control CT scan showed the presence of recurrence in the area of the paratracheostomy. The patient presented asymptomatic at the time, denying pain or peritracheostomy suppuration.
A biopsy of the locoregional recurrence was performed for the HAWK study (NCT02207530 durvalumab in PD-L1 positive patients).

Physical examination
"EKG 0. Weight 72 kg.
"Oral cavity: no pathological findings.
"Neck: lesion in peritracheostomy area, with no signs of local infection. No palpable adenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular area.
"Pulmonary physical examination: preserved vesicular murmur, without added noise.
"Cardiovascular examination: rhythmic cardiac tones, without added murmurs.
"Abdomen: soft, no signs of peritoneal irritation.
"Neurological examination: no signs of acute neurological focality.

Complementary tests
Locoregional recurrence biopsy (24/7/2015): by immunohistochemical determination with the qualitative VENTANA PD-L1 test (SP263, a mouse monoclonal antibody against PD-L1), negativity for PDL-1 was demonstrated (uptake < 25 % in the processed sample). Negativity also for p16, determined by immunohistochemistry.

Diagnosis
The patient is diagnosed with unresectable locoregional recurrence of his disease, PD-L1 negative.

Treatment
Given the negativity for PD-L1, the patient is proposed to enter the clinical trial D419300003 (CONDOR). On 27 August 2015, the patient signed the informed consent to enter the study, being randomised to receive durvalumab 20 mg/kg + tremelimumab 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, and subsequently durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 12 months. He completed treatment in September 2016.

Evolution
The patient showed rapid clinical benefit in the form of local symptomatic control, reaching radiological partial response (according to RECIST criteria) in March 2016. The patient remained in partial response until the end of treatment in September 2016. After that, the partial response was maintained until the last control in January 2018, where disease progression was observed in the form of mediastinal lymphadenopathies, at which time treatment was restarted within the same clinical trial.
At no time did he present immuno-mediated toxicity.
