The patient was a 19 year old male who came for consultation brought by his relatives because of strange behaviour at home. All this had started after a high consumption of cannabis and alcohol, which provoked the sudden appearance of a psychotic episode. He was treated at his mental health centre for 4 months with neuroleptics, with complete remission of symptoms.
The initial diagnosis was Psychotic Cannabis Disorder. A year later, with no new drug use, the psychotic symptoms reappeared, and this time he went to the mental health centre on his own initiative, where he was again treated with neuroleptics, without achieving a complete recovery of the symptoms.
The current diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenic disorder.
The patient has a history of poor academic (dropping out of school) and work performance. The presence of antisocial personality traits is detected.
There is no family history of mental disorder. He has been a cannabis user since the age of 14 (7 years in total), consuming 2-3 times at weekends. Subsequently, consumption increased at the age of 16, moving on to daily consumption, which progressively increased to 8-10 consumptions/day at the time of the first psychotic outbreak. There is also alcohol abuse at weekends and sporadic consumption of amphetamines. With regard to his brother, he is a 28-year-old male, who develops a picture composed of delusions of reference, auditory hallucinations, verbal heteroaggressiveness at home, social isolation, sleep disorders and low mood after three months of working in a company where he works with solvents. 
He started treatment at his Mental Health Centre, where he received a diagnosis of solvent-induced psychotic disorder and was treated with high-dose neuroleptics and anxiolytics, with partial remission of symptoms. The current diagnosis is schizophrenic disorder of undifferentiated type.
