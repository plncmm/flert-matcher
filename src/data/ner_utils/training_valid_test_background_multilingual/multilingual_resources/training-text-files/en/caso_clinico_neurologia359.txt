Anamnesis
Male, 36 years old, smoker of 6 cigarettes/day, with no medical or surgical history of interest. He has a family history of migraine without aura. He does not follow any treatment on a regular basis nor does he consume toxic substances.
The patient came to the Emergency Department with a bilateral frontal oppressive headache of approximately 6 hours' duration, not triggered by physical effort, together with paraesthesia affecting the trunk, face and extremities. It is not associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia or sonophobia. The pain worsens with cervical movements in any direction. From the onset of symptoms, he describes speech impairment consisting of difficulty finding words and writing. Approximately one hour after arrival at the Emergency Department, the headache and sensory symptoms partially improve. However, his language progressively worsens to the point of presenting impoverished language with monosyllables and short unfinished and repetitive sentences. His wife reports that in the last month she has had 3-4 episodes of headache of moderate intensity which, on at least one occasion, are accompanied by right hemicorporal numbness, without language, motor or visual disturbances.

Physical examination
Haemodynamically stable, afebrile. Significant restlessness. Normal cardiopulmonary auscultation. Conscious and oriented in the three spheres. No nuchal rigidity, Kerning and Brudzinski signs negative. Language: articulation and repetition preserved. Failures in naming. Difficulty in understanding some complex commands. Bradylyaly. Unfinished, repetitive sentences. Normoreactive isochoric pupils. Normal ocular motor nerves. Confrontational campimetry and other cranial nerves normal. No motor or sensory deficits, dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Osteotendinous reflexes are normal and symmetrical. The cutaneous-plantar reflex is bilateral flexor and gait is unaltered.

Complementary tests
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm. No repolarisation alterations.
- Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no infiltrates. Free costophrenic sinuses.
- Blood count, coagulation and biochemistry within normal limits.
- Urinalysis: no pathology. No toxins detected.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): parenchymal and ventricular structures without alterations. - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): clear liquid, opening pressure 22 cm H2O, 76 leukocytes with 96% mononuclear, glucose 57 mg/dl, protein 70 mg/dl. Sterile fluid. Cryptococcus, lupus, Borrelia, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 negative.
- Immunology: antiphospholipid, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-DNA, organ-specific and non-organ-specific antibodies negative.
- Serum microbiological study: IgM for cytomegalovirus positive, IgG for varicella zoster virus and HSV positive. Serology for hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, lupus, Borrelia, Brucella negative. Negative cytomegalovirus antigenemia.
- Biomarkers negative.
- Electroencephalogram (EEG): globally slow, fluctuating and with marked reactivity to stimuli suggestive of mild diffuse encephalopathy.
- Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks (performed 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms): permeable carotid axes without atheromatosis, permeable vertebral axes with left dominance. Transcranial: middle cerebral arteries (MCA) patent and symmetrical. Normal velocities and pulsatility indices. Apnoea test: reactivity above normal values in both MCA, greater in the left MCA.
- Magnetic resonance imaging: study within the normal range.
- Brain SPECT: cerebellum and subcortical structures partially hypoperfused. At the cortical level, there was significant bilateral generalised hypoperfusion, with a predominance of large perfusion defects in the left hemisphere, mainly in the frontoparietal region. Brain SPECT on admission: severe global hypoperfusion, predominantly on the left.

Treatment and evolution
The patient presented progression of the focal symptoms described in the hours following his arrival at the ED. A lumbar puncture was performed, detecting lymphocytic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, so treatment was started with acyclovir and the patient was admitted to the Neurology ward on suspicion of viral encephalitis. Twelve hours later, complete remission of symptoms was observed, and the patient partially remembered what had happened. In view of the negative PCR for HSV, antiviral treatment was suspended and analgesia was maintained with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During admission, the patient had an episode of mild acute renal failure secondary to treatment with acyclovir, corrected with abundant hydration. During the following month, the patient had daily episodes of headaches of moderate intensity that subsided with regular analgesia, lasting several hours, and he remained asymptomatic between episodes. On one occasion, the headache was accompanied by altered speech and right hemicorporal hypoaesthesia, which resolved spontaneously. Since then, two months after the first episode, he remains asymptomatic. The SPECT scan was repeated two months after the first episode of neurological focality, with normalisation of cerebral perfusion. SPECT at 2 months: almost complete recovery of left hemicranial hypoperfusion.

Diagnosis
Headache syndrome and transient neurological deficits with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (HaNDL syndrome).
