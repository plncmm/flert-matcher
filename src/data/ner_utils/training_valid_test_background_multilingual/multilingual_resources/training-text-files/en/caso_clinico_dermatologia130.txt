Anamnesis
A 2 year old girl was brought by her mother from the emergency department to be assessed by dermatology. She referred a history of 2 nodular lesions, one in the antecubital fold and the other on the left shoulder blade. The mother reported that they had appeared while they were travelling in Ecuador during an excursion in the forest and that they had persisted since then. The patient presented with pain on palpation and no associated pruritus, and the mother insisted that she saw "something" moving inside the lesions.

Physical examination
Two slightly erythematous nodular lesions were observed in the antecubital fold and on the left shoulder blade, all with a central orifice.

Complementary examinations
Dermoscopy of the lesions: Erythematous lesion with punctate vessels and black dot that moves with palpation and emerges through the orifice with extrusion. The lesions are covered with petroleum jelly and a larva emerges. Dermoscopy of the larva shows a creamy white ovoid body with spirals resembling bird's feet, surrounded by black dots in the shape of a crown of thorns.

Diagnosis
Furunculoid myiasis due to Dermatobia hominis.

Treatment
Spontaneous extrusion of the larvae.

Evolution
Satisfactory, with complete disappearance of the clinical manifestations in both cases.
