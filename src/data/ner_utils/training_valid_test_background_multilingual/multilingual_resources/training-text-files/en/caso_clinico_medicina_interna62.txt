Anamnesis
A 32-year-old woman with ulcer on the right upper extremity. No known drug allergies and no toxic habits. Strict vegetarian. Biologist. 5 months stay in Peru in direct contact with all kinds of animals: monkeys, bats, insects, etc.... Previously vaccinated against yellow fever, hepatitis A and B, typhoid fever and rabies. Since her return to Spain, she has been suffering from night sweats every day while afebrile. Three months later, rounded raised lesion (similar to a cigarette burn), crusted, on the posterior region of the left arm. Worsening and progressive growth as the days went by. He started several courses of antibiotics on an outpatient basis after taking a culture of exudate with growth of S. coagulase negative, (Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin) and topical ointments (Gentamicin) without improvement. After the growth and poor evolution, she was assessed by surgery, increasing the duration of antibiotic treatment and debridement. After this time and due to the persistence of the lesion, increase in size and signs of infection and secondary inflammation, she was referred to the hospital for assessment.
