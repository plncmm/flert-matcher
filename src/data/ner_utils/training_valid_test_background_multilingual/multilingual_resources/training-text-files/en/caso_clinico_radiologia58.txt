A 17-year-old male with a history of a fall on his back a week earlier. He attended the emergency department for lumbosacral pain radiating to the left leg. A lumbosacral CT scan and pelvic MRI showed several collections in the left iliopsoas and piriformis suggestive of haematomas, without traces of fracture. Given the poor clinical evolution, MRI was repeated, showing diffuse uptake of the left sacroiliac joint with fluid inside and bone oedema in relation to sacroiliitis, and persistence of the collections with greater extension and a more organised appearance, compatible with abscesses. Surgical drainage was performed with a positive culture for Staphylococcus aureus.

It was a post-traumatic infectious sacroiliitis associated with abscesses in the adjacent musculature.
