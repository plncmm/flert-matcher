We present the case of a 19 year old boy with no relevant past history of fever, purulent rhinorrhoea in the NIF and progressive pain in the ipsilateral hemiface exacerbated by head movements, of almost a month's evolution, which worsened despite antibiotic treatment; in addition, malar and eyelid oedema leading to double vision and a painful central frontal tumour of hard consistency. On examination, purulent rhinorrhoea at the level of the middle meatus, pain in the malar region and a frontal tumour of approximately 5cm in size, slightly fluctuating, painful. Analysis of infection and CT scan confirmed involvement of the maxillary sinus, ethmoidal cells and left frontal sinus, with bone destruction of the external wall of the same and extension of the inflammatory process to adjacent soft tissues. Surgical intervention was performed: CENS + frontal osteoplasty type Draft IIB + drainage of frontal subperiosteal abscess (CMF); abundant pus was drained and an external frontal penrose was left; favourable evolution. Positive culture for Prevotella Loeschii.
