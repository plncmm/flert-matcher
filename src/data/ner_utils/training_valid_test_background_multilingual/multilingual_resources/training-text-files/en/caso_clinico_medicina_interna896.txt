A 49-year-old male smoker with no adverse drug reactions, with a personal history of hyperuricaemia and psoriasis (without regular treatment). He works in the countryside (working with animals). He came to the emergency department for an episode of 2 weeks' evolution consisting of severe skin inflammation on the right upper limb, accompanied by febrile syndrome. His primary care doctor, whom he had consulted two days earlier, started treatment with Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid, without great improvement (a tetanus booster dose was also administered), for which he was admitted. He reported a wound on the back of his right hand, which he could not explain how or with what it had been made, which in the last 3 days oozed pus and was accompanied by a rise in temperature of up to 40oC, which partially subsided with paracetamol.
Physical examination revealed a blackish, crusty wound on the dorsum of the right hand, with severe inflammatory signs, erythema, crusting and increased skin temperature up to the armpit. Soft ipsilateral axillary mass not clearly demarcated. Radial pulse present. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The blood count showed a leukocytosis of 17100 (71% neutrophils); venous blood gas analysis with pH: 7.38, pCO2: 50, pO2: 12 mmHg; and a biochemistry with potassium of 3.4 and CRP of 23 as notable data. As part of the study to focus on the case, blood cultures (x2) and different serologies were taken and it was decided to start empirical antibiotic treatment with Ciprofloxacin and Clindamycin while awaiting laboratory results. There was a clear clinical and analytical improvement, leaving afebrile and with no other signs of systemic inflammatory response, so it was decided to discharge the patient (pending cultures and serologies to be seen in the outpatient clinic, which were positive for Francisella tularensis).
