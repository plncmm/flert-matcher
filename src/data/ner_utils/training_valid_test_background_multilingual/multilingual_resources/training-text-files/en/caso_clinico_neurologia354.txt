Anamnesis
A 61-year-old female patient with a history of long-standing cervical and mechanical back pain who a week before admission presented with acute cervico-dorsal pain of moderate intensity that did not subside with conventional analgesia, associated with loss of global strength of the right upper limb (MSD) of acute onset within a few hours. She went to the emergency department and a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was normal. In the following days, she had difficulty walking due to distal weakness of both lower limbs, as well as distal corking of the lower limbs, and finally, she reported difficulty initiating urination and only urinating small amounts. In addition, she has had persistent constipation, requiring the administration of a micro-enema. The patient denies any history of trauma, infection or recent vaccination, nor insect or animal bites. Personal history: no adverse drug reactions, intolerance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. No toxic habits. Hypertension under treatment with enalapril. Surgical interventions: hysterectomy for uterine myoma 17 years ago. Baseline situation: autonomous for basic activities of daily living.

Physical examination
Admission findings: blood pressure 154/89 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, temperature 35.1, O2 saturation 97% at baseline. Good general condition, well perfused and hydrated, good skin and mucous membrane colouring. Head and neck: normal, carotid beats rhythmic and symmetrical. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without added noise. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic at 90 bpm, no murmurs or extratonos. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful spontaneously or on palpation, no palpable masses or organomegaly (bladder catheterisation). Decreased bowel sounds. MMII: paedial pulses present, no oedema, no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Neurological examination: in the motor system, there was global weakness of the MSD (2- 3/5) with flaccid hypotonia at this level. Paraparesis MMII 4-/5 proximal and 4+/5 distal, with preserved muscle tone. Osteotendinous reflexes (ROT) exalted in MMII with cutaneous-planatr reflex right extensor in withdrawal and left initiates extension. ROT abolished in the MSD and very diminished in the left upper limb (MSI). Tactile-algesic hypoaesthesia especially in the left lower limb (LLM), without being able to delimit a clear sensory level. Normal arthrokinetic proprioceptive sensitivity. Normal cranial nerves, cerebellum and coordination: normal in MMII and MSI, very artefactual in MSD due to motor deficit.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: haemogram, coagulation, biochemistry with hepatic and renal profile within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP): normal.
- Chest X-ray: normal.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): normal.
- Serology negative for Mycoplasma, lupus, Borrelia, human immunodeficiency virus and neurotropic virus.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): normal.
- Cervico-dorsal MRI: intramedullary lesion located in the lateral cord, at the level of C5-C6, 27 mm long and 7 mm in maximum transverse diameter. Its signal is hyperintense on T2. No paravertebral masses are seen. Vertebral bodies of normal morphology and signal intensity. Cervical intervertebral discs of normal morphology, height and signal intensity, with no evidence of disc herniation or protrusion. Discrete loss of signal intensity in the D2-D3 disc in relation to dehydration. Conclusion: C5-C6 intramedullary cavernous angioma with extensive cervicodorsal acute subacute myelitis. She was assessed by the neurosurgery department of another hospital, which proposed spinal angiography, which the patient refused for the time being.

Diagnosis
- Acute non-traumatic myelopathy of vascular cause secondary to right C5-C6 intramedullary cavernous angioma.
- Neuropathic pain with metameric-radicular distribution at C8-T2 right and contralateral hemitronchus and IIM.

Treatment and evolution
The patient has progressively improved the motor deficit, presenting at discharge: mild right brachial paresis (4+/5) and left crural (4+/5), although she can walk without any type of support, with a decrease in thermoalgesic sensitivity in the MSD and the MII with very discreet alteration of proprioceptive sensitivity in the MII. During admission, and subsequently during neurological follow-up, the patient presented neuropathic pain with metameric-radicular distribution at the level of right C8-T2 and in the MII that required various combinations of drugs: gabapentin + clonazepam + amitriptyline, which was changed due to persistence of the symptoms with slight improvement despite using the optimal therapeutic doses of trileptal + pregabalin with adequate response until the present time. When trying to start treatment with carbamazepine, she had an allergic reaction, so it was discontinued. The patient completely improved her urinary complaints, requiring treatment with solifenacin, and also her intestinal complaints, requiring only treatment with micro-enemas during the first days of admission. Two and a half years later, the patient came to the emergency department three days prior to admission for cervical pain and cramping in the right arm, making it impossible to lift it, as well as pain, tingling and cramping in the lower limbs at the distal level, making it impossible to walk properly. She reported no urinary urgency or constipation. The neurological examination showed the following data. Strength: right brachial monoparesis (2/5), strength preserved in the MMII, ROT alive in the MSD, slightly exalted in the MID with rapidly exhaustible clonoid right achilles response, bilateral flexor RCP. Sensitivity: crossed algesic tactile hypoaesthesia in the MID and SDM with very discrete alteration of proprioceptive sensitivity in the MID. Preserved gait without support, including heel-toe and toe-to-toe. Very difficult tandem gait without support. During the new admission to the Neurology ward, another cerebral and cervical-dorsal MRI study was performed, showing rebleeding of the intramedullary cavernous angioma. The patient will be assessed again in the neurosurgery department, although no decision has been made regarding future surgical treatment. On discharge she is in her baseline condition prior to the second admission.
