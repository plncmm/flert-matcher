A 14 year old boy came to the clinic with urticarial symptoms immediately after eating several mushrooms. He also presented with rhinoconjunctivitis in September.
The symptoms had occurred after the ingestion of thistle mushroom
(Pleurotus eryngii) and Juniper mushroom (Leucopaxillus candidus / Clitocybe candida ).
It tolerates cooked mushrooms without problems.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Prick-prick with raw and cooked mushrooms: with positive result for all of them.
Prick-prick to pneumoallergens: with positive result to Alternaria.
A western blot was performed to see the allergenic characteristics of mushrooms and Alternaria.

Results:
Prick-prick with fresh and cooked mushrooms were positive, as well as SPT to Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Aspergillus. All other inhalants were negative. Alternaria-specific IgE: positive
The Alternaria blot showed several reactive IgE proteins, with two proteins being recognised. One of approximately 14 kDa compatible with Alt a 1 and another of 45 kDa that could be compatible with Alt a 6 (enolase).

Conclusions:
We present a case of immediate reaction after ingestion of cooked mushrooms, with recognition of the allergens of the ingested species and the fungus Alternaria alternata.
