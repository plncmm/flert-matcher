A 34-year-old woman came to the emergency department with dyspnoea, general malaise and pruritic skin rash. Laboratory tests showed iron deficiency anaemia. She has a child with chickenpox. Suspicion of varicella and after a chest X-ray (the findings on the X-ray were overlooked by the attending clinician), specific treatment and home rest were decided. Two days later she came in for increased dyspnoea and a feeling of extreme fatigue. An emergency radiologist was consulted and after reviewing the previous X-ray, it was decided to perform a chest CT scan in view of the clinical worsening.

The CT scan showed multiple nodular opacities with diameters between 5-10 mm surrounded by a low-attenuation halo, i.e. with a "halo sign" distributed in both hemithoraxes, with a greater number and size in the upper lobes and some of them with a tendency to coalesce, without cavitation or calcification. Given the patient's familial epidemiology, clinical manifestations and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is viral bronchopneumonia secondary to varicella-zoster, with pulmonary opacities probably corresponding to pseudo-infiltrates with perilesional bleeding (halo sign).
