Reason for consultation
Cervical tumour and fever.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests).
Anamnesis
No RAMS. Cardiac rhabdomyoma in infancy which was not found. Mixed headache. No usual treatment.

We present the case of a 21-year-old male who consulted his primary care physician for a lump in the right cervical region of two days' evolution associated with general malaise and high fever (up to 41o). He reported that it had been increasing over time. She denies previous trauma. No dysphagia or dyspnoea. Suspecting infectious mononucleosis, treatment was prescribed, laboratory tests and MNI test were requested.
Three days later, she was admitted to the hospital emergency department for high fever and pain in the right cervical region, where she was admitted for examination.

Exploration
BEG. BHP. Eupneic. Normal colour and fever. ACR without alterations, heart rhythmic at 80 bpm.
Examination of the area revealed a painful, warm, red, right laterocervical tumour with limitation of neck mobility, which appeared to be an abscess. It extends from the left mandibular angle at its most caudal pole and downwards to the middle cervical third. No trismus, dental pieces in good condition to the naked eye, no discharge of purulent material or signs of sialolithiasis. ENT without exudate. Abdomen without peritonism.

He was assessed by maxillofacial surgery who, in view of the clinical and radiological findings, did not consider it a pathology with a surgical approach at that time.

Summary of complementary tests
** CBC with blood count without leukocytosis and normal red series. Biochemistry without alterations, transaminases without elevation. Coagulation INR 1.22. Thyroid hormones
** Peripheral blood smear: negative for mononucleosis, positive for bacterial infection.
** Chest X-ray: normal, with thickened cords.
** Sputum culture and BAAR negative.
** Serology negative for Q fever, HBV, HCV, HAV, Brucella, HIV, Borrelia.
** Negative Mantoux with Booster.
** Transthoracic echocardiography without intracavitary masses, normal.
** Cervical CT scan: asymmetric thickening of homogeneous density of the ECM suggestive of inflammation/infection. In depth, a laterocervical polyadenopathic process with lymphadenopathy up to 16mm is observed.
** Thoracic and abdominal CT scan: discrete hepatosplenomegaly. There is no adenopathic involvement in the study.
** BAG of adenopathy: fibroadipose tissue without relevant alterations.

Family and community approach
21-year-old male who lives with his parents and a healthy brother. He works as a computer programmer. He has no family history of infection or TB. He has had two cats and a dog for years, well vaccinated.

Clinical judgement (list of problems, differential diagnosis)
Polyadenopathic syndrome due to non-specific reactive lymphadenitis. Suspected Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome.
Infectious sternocleidomastoid pyomyositis.

Action plan and evolution
The evolution was favourable, the patient was admitted for study for 7 days and reported improvement with the antibiotics and antipyretics administered. The lesion also decreased and resolved by the end of his stay on the ward.
Ten months later, the patient had the same clinical picture but on the contralateral side, on this occasion a PET scan was performed which revealed new supra- and infradiaphragmatic adenopathies with benign histology. The diagnostic process was prolonged for 2 years as it was a diagnosis of exclusion. Currently, the patient has again requested an appointment with his family doctor due to the appearance of new axillary lymphadenopathy. He is awaiting an analysis, abdominal and axillary ultrasound scan.
