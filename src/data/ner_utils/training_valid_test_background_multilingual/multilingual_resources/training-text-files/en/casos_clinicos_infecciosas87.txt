A 28-year-old man from Peru who had been living in Spain for two weeks. He had no history of interest, no contact with animals, no toxic habits, and no usual treatment.

He came to the emergency department for scapular pain, intense dyspnoea and fever of up to 39oC of five days' evolution. He had no oral problems or pharyngeal pain, cough, expectoration, symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or known risk factors for liver cirrhosis. On examination he was haemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 124/85 mmHg and 95 bpm, febrile (38.3oC), sweating, with adequate respiratory rate, saturating at 97% without oxygen therapy. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination showed no alterations. There were no meningeal signs, oropharyngeal alterations or stigmata of endocarditis. There were no findings in the lower limbs suggestive of venous thrombosis.

Laboratory results showed marked leukocytosis (20,840 cells/microL) with neutrophilia (18,110 cells/microL) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations of 255 mg/L and procalcitonin of 0.6 ng/mL. There was also an increase in total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dl), at the expense of an increase in direct bilirubin, and an increase in transaminases (GPT 155 IU/l, GOT 40 IU/l). Blood cultures, pneumococcal antigen in urine and chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules with dubious cavitation in some of them. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours and metronidazole 500 mg/8 hours was started and admission to the Infectious Diseases ward was requested.

Differential diagnosis
We will establish the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever and multiple pulmonary nodules. The most frequent causes of multiple pulmonary nodules and fever are neoplasms, systemic inflammatory diseases, infections and vascular processes.
- Malignant neoplasms. These may be primary lung (mainly adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) or metastatic (bronchial carcinoma, colon, breast, kidney, melanoma and sarcoma as the most frequent causes). Another infrequent cause in this section are neuroendocrine carcinoid tumours, typically endobronchial. The patient had no risk factors for lung carcinoma. The clinical manifestations of these neoplasms tend to be more severe than those presented by the patient; in addition, symptoms indicative of primary involvement of one of the presumed affected organs are frequent in the case of suspected metastasis, accompanied by constitutional symptoms.
- Benign tumours. The most frequent cause of benign lung tumours is hamartoma, with a mixed histological component, slow progressive growth and a popcorn-like appearance on radiography and computed axial tomography (CT).
- Multiple pulmonary thromboembolism, as a cause of pulmonary infarcts, could be considered in the differential diagnosis, but was ruled out by clinical and contrast-enhanced chest CT (see later findings).
- Systemic inflammatory diseases. This group includes, among others, Wegener's disease (multiple pulmonary nodules associated with otorhinolaryngological and renal involvement) and Churg Strauss vasculitis3 (atopy, previous asthma, eosinophilia, migratory pulmonary infiltrates, neurological involvement). Other diseases included in the differential diagnosis are rheumatoid arthritis (pulmonary rheumatoid nodules, accompanied by distal erosive symmetric polyarthritis), sarcoidosis (typically with bilateral hilar adenopathy) and amyloidosis (associated with amyloid deposition in other locations).
- Infectious. These are the most frequent cause within the benign aetiology group.
These include the following:
- Mycobacteria. Their symptoms are usually more severe, with progressive deterioration of the general condition, fever, sweating and haemoptotic cough.
- Fungi. They are endemic in certain areas of America. They sometimes cause pneumonia associated with the presence of nodules. Histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis and paracoccidiomycosis.
- Septic emboli secondary to right-sided endocarditis, typical of injecting drug users, mostly secondary to Staphylococcus aureus infection.
- Lemierre's syndrome, septic thrombophlebitis from parapharyngeal abscess, caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum.
- Necrotising pneumonia caused by some strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus and anaerobes.

Evolution
After his transfer to the Infectious Diseases ward, a CT scan of the chest with contrast was requested, in which no repletion defects were seen in the pulmonary arteries, ruling out pulmonary thromboembolism. Multiple pulmonary nodules were visualised, with no necrosis inside, peripherally distributed (mostly subpleural) affecting all the pulmonary lobes, compatible with septic emboli. No mediastinal adenopathies were visualised. Abdominal sections showed a nodule in the periphery of segment V of the liver, with peripheral uptake and central hypodensity, compatible with abscess, so the study was completed with CT of the abdomen. This showed a hypodense vascular structure in the central area of the liver leading to the inferior vena cava, compatible with thrombosis of the minor suprahepatic branch. Circumferential thickening of the wall of the jejunal loops (left) with an inflammatory-infectious appearance was also detected. No portal thrombosis was observed.

On the same day, the Microbiology Department reported the growth of Bacteroides fragilis in blood culture. The patient progressed favourably with the prescribed antibiotic therapy (metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours intravenously), with fever disappearing after 24 hours and presenting clear clinical improvement, with no dyspnoea and no general affectation.

During admission, the following complementary tests were requested in order to identify the origin of the symptoms:
- Transthoracic echocardiography and later transesophageal echocardiography, which ruled out the presence of endocarditis. - Doppler ultrasound of supra-aortic trunks, which ruled out jugular thrombosis.
- Intestinal entero-resonance. Hyperenhancement of the proximal jejunum was still observed. The liver abscess had decreased considerably in size. Thrombosis of one of the suprahepatic veins was still present. No portal thrombosis or other alterations were observed.
- Control laboratory tests. They showed a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants and liver cytolysis enzymes.
- Control X-ray: slight improvement of the nodular lesions.
After 7 days of hospitalisation and for personal reasons, the patient requested voluntary discharge, having shown clear symptomatic improvement, and oral treatment with metronidazole 250 mg 2 tablets every 8 hours was established for a total of 28 days.

Final diagnosis
Pulmonary septic embolism caused by Bacteroides fragilis secondary to proximal jejunitis.
