We present the case of a 44-year-old Spanish woman with a history of breast cancer 5 years ago in remission, which was treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She is being treated with tamoxifen, folic acid and IM vitamin B12. She denies toxic habits. Teacher by profession. No animals, no contact with the countryside. No previous trips.
She presented with "passing something when defecating" the day before the consultation, together with abdominal distension and discomfort of several months' duration. No nausea or vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhoea or fever. In the general laboratory tests, there was a slight leucopenia (3.35x10^3nL) with 0.33x10^3nL eosinophils; the rest of the parameters were normal. The autoimmunity test was negative. Peripheral blood smear showed mild eosinophilia. A stool culture, Clostridium difficile toxin and parasites were requested on 2 batches of 3 samples collected every other day, all of which were negative. Based on the patient's eosinophilia, the differential diagnosis was made.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of eosinophilia will depend on whether the patient is an immigrant or an autochthonous patient, a traveller or has HIV infection1. In our case, the patient is an autochthonous patient, so we must consider several major groups:
- Allergic reactions: such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, pharmacological reactions. In the western world, the main cause of eosinophilia tends to be allergic reactions, but we have ruled this out as our patient does not report any relevant history.
- Pharmacological: Drugs are a frequent cause of eosinophilia in Western countries, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, antihypertensives and antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones and sulphonamides. Her regular treatment with tamoxifen, acfol and optovite was not related to the eosinophilia.
- Neoplasms and haematological disorders: primary eosinophilic syndrome (HES), acute or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia in which immature eosinophils would be seen in the smear. In addition, other myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms are also included. Solid tumours, mainly adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, large intestine), lung and squamous epithelium (cervix, vagina, penis, skin, nasopharynx, bladder). The smear showed mature eosinophils, so we ruled out haematological tumours. She had had breast cancer, but was being monitored by oncology and had been in complete remission for several years.
- Immunological and rheumatological diseases: here we found systemic autoimmune diseases (Churg Strauss, eosinophilic fasciitis, severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis or Wegener's granulomatosis). We ruled it out as the autoimmunity study was negative.
- Endocrine-metabolic diseases: adrenal insufficiency. This was ruled out on the basis of analytical results.
- Parasites and other infections: helminths are the most commonly identified infectious cause of infectious eosinophilia. Although they are more frequent in patients from tropical regions, there are also some parasitosis capable of producing eosinophilia in our environment. The native helminths that most frequently cause it are: 
- Strongyloidiasis: Strongyloides stercolaris. Penetrates directly into the skin on contact with soil or water contaminated with human faeces. Can have a latency of years. - Toxocariasis: Toxocara canis and cati. Can be ingested with soil or food contaminated with dog or cat faeces. Severe systemic involvement.
- Trichinellosis: Trichinella spiralis. Transmitted by ingestion of undercooked meat, especially pork. Diagnosis of the above three would be made by serology.
- Anisakis spp: Associated with the ingestion of raw fish such as salted, smoked, pickled or undercooked fish. Diagnosis is made by visualisation of the worm recovered from emesis or by endoscopy. Detection of specific IgE.
- Echinococcus granulosus: humans are infected by ingestion of Echinococcus eggs present in contaminated food, water or soil.
- Fasciola hepatica, infection is acquired through ingestion of contaminated raw vegetables or water.
- Taenia spp: transmitted by ingestion of undercooked meat. Diagnosis is made by clinical history and morphometric features after visualisation of faecal eggs and rings.

Evolution
After this first consultation, we advised the patient to take a photograph if she passed this material through her anus again. The following week, the patient came in with only the image of a white elastic material almost a metre long, she subsequently reported tenesmus and emission of rings of similar characteristics to the previous one but smaller: 1 or 2 cm long and barely 1 mm thick, she brought this smaller material, which was sent to microbiology and the diagnosis was obtained. It was a proglottide of Taenia spp (probably T. saginata). After the diagnosis of taeniasis, he was treated with Praziquantel 5-10mg/kg body weight in a single dose (450mg). Stool monitoring was recommended for 3 months after treatment. The case was discussed with the preventive service, who indicated that hand washing and hygiene were necessary, but contacts did not need to take any special measures. She was subsequently reviewed in the outpatient Infectious Diseases department: since treatment she was completely asymptomatic and had no further discharge of the whitish material described above from the anus.

Final diagnosis
Taenia saginata infestation.
