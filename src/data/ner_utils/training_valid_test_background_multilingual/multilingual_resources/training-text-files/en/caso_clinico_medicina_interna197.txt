A 55-year-old woman, with no past history of interest, presented in the last 10 days with maculo-papular exanthema, non-pruritic, associated with polyarthritis; 5 days later she began with fever up to 39oC, occipital headache and cervicalgia associated with photophobia, myodesopsia and loss of visual acuity, starting with genital pain and odynophagia secondary to the appearance of aphthous lesions both at genital and oral level. The patient reported contact with a patient with chickenpox, although she reported having had the infection in adolescence. Examination revealed nuchal rigidity in the last degrees of flexion, and polyarthritis in the lower limbs, with the rest of the examination being unremarkable. He was admitted to Internal Medicine with suspicion of complicated chickenpox.
The examination revealed nuchal rigidity in the last degrees of flexion, as well as polyarthritis in the lower limbs, with the rest of the examination being unremarkable.
A lumbar puncture was performed which revealed acute lymphocytic meningitis, so a sample was sent to microbiology, requesting PCR for viruses, which were negative. In the analysis, serology was determined to be positive for CMV IgG and VVZ IgG, the rest being negative, as well as autoimmunity, with positive HLA B51. A genital biopsy was performed and reported as "chronic and acute infectious infiltrate". On the other hand, the patient consulted an ophthalmologist who diagnosed anterior uveitis.
In view of these findings, a differential diagnosis was made between 2 entities.
Varicella infection:
- In favour: Contact with chickenpox. Fever.
- Against: Past chickenpox infection. Positive Ig G serology. Aseptic meningitis.
Anterior uveitis. Non-pruritic papular lesions. Genital aphthosis.
- Outbreak of Behçet's disease:
- In favour: oral and genital aphthous ulcers. Anterior uveitis. Aseptic meningitis. Papular skin lesions. HLA B51 positive.
- Against: More frequent between 20-30 years of age.
The patient fulfilled the criteria for Behçet's disease and was diagnosed with "aseptic meningitis secondary to Neurobehçet's", starting treatment with systemic steroids, with resolution of the symptoms.
