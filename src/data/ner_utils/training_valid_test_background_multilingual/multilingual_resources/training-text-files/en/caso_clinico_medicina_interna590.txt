A 79 year old patient came to the emergency department with a bad evolution of a spider bite that had bitten him after he had put on his bathrobe. The patient started with a sting in the right latero-cervical area, followed by pruritus and a single small maculo-papular lesion, evolving within a few hours into hot, painful oedema and local swelling, which progressively increased without improvement. Twenty-four hours after the bite, a lighelloid plaque appeared in the area of the bite and serous blisters with an erythematous area of cellulitis around them.
The patient was in good general condition, but with intense pain in the left supraclavicular area and significant oedema with fluctuation on which there was a 6 cm erythematous-violaceous plaque with irregular boundaries, well-defined and an erythematous area extending to the breast together with a mobile and painful supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
In the emergency department, due to the poor clinical evolution, an incision-contra incision was made over the most fluctuant area, with no externalisation of pus.
Complementary studies: leukocytosis with neutrophilia, the rest normal. Diagnosis: cutaneous loxoscelism. The patient recognised the spider when shown a photograph of a specimen.
She was treated on the ward with corticosteroids, antihistamines and prophylactic antibiotics due to the risk of superinfection, with a very good clinical evolution. She remained stable, with no evidence of systemic involvement, apyretic, blood cultures were negative and antibiotic therapy was suspended.
