We present a 26-year-old male who was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department for fever and cutaneous-mucosal lesions accompanied by whitish urethral discharge and dysuria since three days before admission. As epidemiological history of interest, he reported unprotected sex with several heterosexual contacts in the last month.
On physical examination he was febrile (39.5o), normotensive, well perfused, eupneic and with no evidence of sepsis. He had millimetric submaxillary and left axillary lymphadenopathies, rolling and non-painful; involvement of the oral mucosa with necrotic desquamation of the lips, petechiae on the palate, whitish exudate and significant pain; asymptomatic macular periungual lesions on both hands, feet and scrotal and urethral level with no visible secretions. In addition, he had a dry cough with crackles in the right base.
Complementary tests showed monocytosis with left shift, elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 17.3, ESR 50, PCT 0.19) and an interstitial infiltrate in the right lower lobe. Serological results ruled out HIV, CMV, EBV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C. Blood cultures were negative while cultures of oral cavity and urethral exudate showed HSV-1 and Chlamydia trachomatis infection respectively. Dermatological assessment confirmed erythema multiforme multiforme major with involvement of the oral mucosa and acral areas reactive to the infectious process.
The patient showed rapid clinical, analytical and radiological improvement, with complete resolution of the lesions after symptomatic treatment and empirical antibiotherapy with Ceftriaxone, Doxycycline and Acyclovir for 10 days and a dose of Azithromycin. At one month follow-up the control serologies were negative and the complete examination was rigorously normal.
