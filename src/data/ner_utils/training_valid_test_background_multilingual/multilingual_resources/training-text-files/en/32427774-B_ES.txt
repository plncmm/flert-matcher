sA 55-year-old woman with a history of asthma, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and type II diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, dyspnoea and weakness of about 2.5 weeks' evolution.
2.5 weeks of evolution. His primary care physician had prescribed azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and levofloxacin, and he came to our ED from home. His vital signs on admission were T 39.4°C, pulse 111 bpm, blood pressure 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate 27, with SpO2 of 92% and PaO2 of 51 mmHg on room air. A chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates in both lungs. She was given oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and taken to the ward for observation. On day 4 of hospitalisation she developed tachypnoea and her dyspnoea worsened. She was placed on a 100% reservoir mask, with minimal improvement; her PaO2 was 67 mmHg. She was transferred to the ICU for possible impending intubation. The COVID-19 test was positive. On hospital day 5, she had a high D-dimer (8.34 ug/mL) and fibrinogen (899 mg/dL). The next day his PaO2 had decreased to 59 mmHg, despite the mask; it was decided to start treatment with APt. On day 1 post-treatment, his PaO2 improved to 72 mmHg, his D-dimer increased to > 20 ug/mL and his fibrinogen decreased to 535 mg/dL. He remained on a 100% reservoir mask. On day 2 post-treatment, he completed the hydroxychloroquine regimen and was started on methylprednisolone 80 mg every 24 hours. He started to tolerate movement better and to interact with staff; his PaO2 increased to 77 mmHg. D-dimer remained above 20 ug/mL. On day 3 post-treatment, the reservoir mask was replaced with a 6L nasal cannula. D-dimer decreased to 4.56 ug/mL. On day 6 after treatment she was transferred to the ward and i.v. heparin was withdrawn; at this time the D-dimer was 1.91 ug/mL. The patient felt well with no new symptoms, and was able to breathe in room air. On day 8 post-treatment, the patient was no longer dyspnoeic and was discharged on a tapering steroid regimen.
