Anamnesis
A 66-year-old woman, right-handed, teacher, with a personal history of dyslipidaemia on treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/day. She has been consulting for about 2 months because of increasingly frequent memory lapses, difficulty in finding the right word in the course of a conversation and in recalling names of everyday objects. She has lost valuable objects, has become disorientated in familiar places, and when driving along streets that she is used to, she has even driven in a forbidden direction. She also reports a decreased ability to maintain attention and concentrate, sometimes becoming "blocked" and not being able to continue with the intellectual activity she was carrying out. He believes that these symptoms have been slowly and progressively worsening. In addition, for the last 10 days, he has been experiencing almost daily episodes of paraesthesia in the lower part of the left side of the face, lasting minutes, and occasionally ipsilateral periorbital "shooting" pain. She also describes asthenia and daytime drowsiness of recent onset. She reports a good mood.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, pulse 75 bpm, axillary temperature 36.2 oC. Collaborative. No carotid murmurs. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. No skin alterations. The neurological examination revealed left facial hypoaesthesia in the V3 region, with the rest of the cranial nerves being normal. The osteotendinous reflexes are symmetrical at 1⁄4⁄4, and the cutaneous-plantar reflexes in flexion. There are no motor deficits in the limbs and no impairment of deep or superficial sensation. Cerebellar tests are normal. Romberg's test is negative and gait is normal. In the MMSE: 27/30 points, with two failures in temporospatial orientation and one failure in attention and calculation. Language is fluent, grammatically correct, without paraphasia or alteration in naming. Writing and reading are normal. There is a loss of attention and concentration skills. There are no deficits in praxias or gnosias and in the area of memory the values are adequate for his age and educational level. In the Hamilton test for depression the score is normal.

Complementary tests
- Brain MRI: isolated foci of leukoaraiosis in the white matter of both hemispheres, with no other alterations. Brain MRI, axial section, showing isolated foci of leukoaraiosis.
- Brain metabolism PET with 18-FDG: no alterations in the metabolism of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamic regions, midbrain, trunk or cerebellar hemispheres. PET of cerebral metabolism with 18-FDG. Axial projection at the level of the basal ganglia. Study within normal limits.
- EEG: normal background activity (10 Hz, 50 uV). No abnormalities at rest or under stimulation.
- Blood tests: CBC, ESR, coagulation tests without alterations. Folic acid, vitamin B12, homocysteine, ACE, basal TSH, vitamin E and B12, ionogram, liver and renal function and lipid profile without alterations. ANA, ENA, ANCA negative. Antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies, a-TPO, a-TGB negative. HIV negative. VDRL syphilis serology: negative. Lyme serology (Borrelia burgdorferi): IgM positive (0.45/0.32); IgG negative. Lyme serology. Confirmatory. Immunoblot: IgM positive.
- CSF analysis: glucose 68 mg/dl, protein 41.6 mg/dl. Cells 0/ul. Oligoclonal bands in both CSF and serum, with coincident pattern. IgG/albumin ratio: 0.39. Bacteriological culture negative. Syphilis serology negative. Lyme serology: negative. Protein 14.3.3 negative. Negative onconeuronal antibodies.  

Diagnosis
The picture of recurrent haemifacial paraesthesias in a patient with complaints of loss of memory and ability to concentrate, episodes of disorientation and confusion, associated with a positive IgM serology for Borrelia burgdorferi, is compatible with neuroborreliosis.

Treatment
Treatment was started with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/12 h for one month and doxycycline 100 mg/12 h orally for 12 weeks, with progressive improvement.

Evolution
Within 2 weeks of starting treatment, the hemifacial sensory disturbance and headache, as well as hypersomnia, asthenia, episodes of confusion, memory complaints and impaired ability to concentrate, had disappeared.
