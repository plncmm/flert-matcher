Obese 44-year-old male, with no other known cardiovascular risk factors, ex-addict to inhaled drugs for 10 years and ex-drinker for a year, with no current toxic habits and a history of enolic pancreatitis in 2006. He has been living in a drug rehabilitation centre for the last year. She came to the emergency department for three days of intense cough with purulent expectoration, fever of 41oC with "shivering" and liquid stools. Hours before coming to the hospital, she began to experience progressive dyspnoea, haemoptysis and haematuria. Physical examination on arrival revealed poor general condition, he was conscious and oriented, mucocutaneous pallor and intense respiratory work. Saturation of 98% with high-flow CPAP and blood pressure of 220/130 mmHg. On auscultation he is tachycardic and the vesicular murmur is diminished with generalised crackles in both lung fields. There were no other findings of interest on examination. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started with cefotaxime (2 g intravenous - IV - every 6 hours) and levofloxacin (500 mg IV every 12 hours) with the aim of covering the most frequent microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and serum therapy. Serial blood cultures were taken and urine tests for pneumococcal and Legionella antigens were requested. The first laboratory tests revealed previously unknown renal failure, thrombopenia, lymphopenia and alterations in basic coagulation parameters (see table 1). The initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed a bilateral alveolar pulmonary infiltrate, nodular in appearance at the left paracardial level, with bilateral posterobasal impingement and retrosternal air trapping in the lateral projection. After the initial measures, the patient deteriorated, hypotension appeared, increased hypoxaemia and he was transferred to the ICU where he required orotracheal intubation (OTI). After OTI, several bronchial aspirate samples (BAS) are taken.

Differential diagnosis
The patient is admitted with sepsis due to CAP. The main microorganisms causing CAP are:
- Streptococcus pneumoniae: microorganism that mainly causes pneumonia, although it can cause infections at other levels (primary peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with renal disease, meningitis, etc.). 
- Haemophilus influenzae: its incidence has decreased following the introduction of vaccination against type b, but it should be suspected in elderly patients or those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: can be found, like others, colonising the pharynx of elderly people, cirrhotics, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, malnutrition or active neoplasia.
- Coxiella burnetii: to be suspected in patients exposed to animals (cattle, rodents, birds or tick bites) in endemic areas.


In the case of severe CAP, such as the one presented by our patient, we should also think of:
- Staphylococcus aureus: especially if there is any type of immunosuppression (alcoholics, diabetics, parenteral drug users, traumatic brain injury, influenza virus infection or OTI), although cases have been described in previously healthy patients. Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing strains, especially methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) strains, can cause severe necrotising pneumonia. It should therefore be considered in a previously healthy young adult or child with a rapidly progressive lung infection that and/or is accompanied by lung necrosis, shock and neutropenia.
- Influenza virus (Influenzavirus A, B or C): diagnosis is usually clinical and the most frequent symptoms are chills, fever, myalgia, headache, non-productive cough and/or odynophagia. It can also cause viral pneumonia or bacterial superinfections. In the case of infection by the H5N1 virus, a severe infection can occur with pneumonia, sometimes haemorrhagic and with a severe course.
- Legionella pneumophila: by inhalation of contaminated aerosols. People with chronic diseases, smoking, the elderly or immunocompromised, especially transplant recipients, are at greater risk. Antigenuria for Legionella pneumophila is a rapid detection method, with high sensitivity and specificity, and should be complemented with DNA detection techniques by PCR and direct immunofluorescence.
- Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae: it is difficult to estimate its incidence due to the difficulties involved in its diagnosis, which can be made by serology (microimmunofluorescence), immunohistochemistry, PCR or culture.
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae: mainly a pathogen of children and adolescents but increasingly common in adults, especially the elderly. Diagnostic methods include culture (slow-growing), PCR and serology with IgM (increase at the end of the first week) and IgG.
- Anaerobic infection: in aspiration, presence of lung cavity in a patient predisposed to bronchoaspiration or existence of purulent discharge (sputum or empyema).
- Fungal infections, such as Aspergillus spp: mainly cause extrinsic allergic alveolitis and asthma, chronic sinusitis in atopics, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Pneumonia usually occurs in patients with severe and prolonged neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease, COPD, alcoholism, liver cirrhosis and/or diabetes mellitus.

Evolution
In the first 12 hours after admission to the ICU, progressive deterioration is maintained, with vasoactive amines, renal failure and respiratory failure are established. Given the persistence of the shock situation, Linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours iv) was added to the initial treatment and the microbiological study was extended, adding HIV, hepatitis virus (HV) and "atypical" pneumonia serology to the requests, as well as PCR determination of influenza virus in BAS extracted after the IOT. During this period we began to obtain the microbiological results of the initial samples taken: in the first batch of blood cultures, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) grew, as it did in the BAS, where MRSA was isolated (with the same sensitivity profile) and Aspergillus fumigatus grew. The smear microscopy was negative, as was the antigenuria for pneumococcus and legionella and the influenza test. Serology was negative for HIV, HBV and atypical pneumonias: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetti and Legionella pneumophila. The determination of IgG HCV antibodies was positive, so PCR was performed to detect viral RNA, which was negative. In view of these results, the study was extended and B-D Glucan and Galactomannan were requested in serum and BAS, and then the current antibiotic therapy was modified to Linezolid and Voriconazole.
The blood cultures taken 24 hours after the start of treatment were still positive for MRSA. After 48 hours they were negative. The determination of Galactomannan and B-D Glucan in serum as well as Galactomannan in BAS were positive.
Clinical, analytical and radiological stabilisation was achieved 72 hours after admission. Antibiotic therapy was maintained until day 7, when a new febrile peak appeared accompanied by frank clinical deterioration. New microbiological samples were collected: serial blood cultures, urine culture, BAS. The central catheter was checked and showed no evidence of infection, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed where there were no lesions suspicious of endocarditis. On day 11 the patient died. The results of the last blood cultures, urine culture and BAS were negative.

Final diagnosis
Septic shock with multi-organ failure due to MRSA bacteremic CAP. Colonisation by Aspergillus fumigatus.
