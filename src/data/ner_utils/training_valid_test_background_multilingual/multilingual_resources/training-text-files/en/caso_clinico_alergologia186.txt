10-year-old girl diagnosed with rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma due to allergy to olive and grass pollens, and oral allergy syndrome with fruit and vegetables due to allergy to profilin. He had previously undergone two years of sublingual immunotherapy against pollens, which had to be discontinued due to poor tolerance (cough and respiratory stridor). Subsequently, a new cycle of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy against pollens (olive and grasses) was started in our hospital, with poor tolerance during induction in the form of episodes of sudden coughing and laryngeal stridor, maintaining at all times a non-pathological pulmonary auscultation, oxygen saturation and normal vital signs. However, given the high suspicion of the existence of a psychogenic component involved in the condition, it was decided to administer the next dose under surveillance in our Technical Area and in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, masked manner. After the placebo dose, the patient reproduced the same symptoms, which progressively subsided after the corresponding dose of immunotherapy. Thus, the psychogenic component was proven to be the main cause of the clinical picture and the immunotherapy could be continued and all chronic treatment related to her cough could be withdrawn.

We present the case of a patient who presented with an immediate cough and stridor as a reaction to immunotherapy and who was able to continue her treatment without incident after the psychogenic origin of the reaction was established.
