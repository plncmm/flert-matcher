Anamnesis
A 46-year-old patient with a personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, former injecting drug addict (heroin), HIV positive on monotherapy with DRV/r with good control (CD4 440 and undetectable viral load), HCV genotype 1b coinfection with no signs of portal hypertension and under follow-up by Dermatology for neutrophilic dermatosis. He was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department in August 2012 for a clinical picture of progressive weakness and visual disturbances associated with a deterioration in the level of consciousness. A normal lumbar puncture was performed, syphilis and toxoplasma serology was negative, herpes simplex PCR 1, 2 and varicella were negative. The infectious origin of the process was ruled out, and Neurology was notified for assessment.

Physical examination
General examination: bedridden patient in acceptable general condition, well hydrated and perfused, eupneic at rest and speech. Afebrile. Blood pressure 160/100 mmHg. Weight 85 kg. Cushingoid appearance. Cardiac auscultation with rhythmic tones, at a good frequency, without audible murmurs. Respiratory auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur with no added pathological sounds. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no palpable masses or megaliths, no signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Papuloerythematous and pruritic lesions on the trunk.  Neurological examination: good level of consciousness, oriented, emotional lability with a tendency to cry. No language disorders. Left homonymous hemianopsia. Motor balance: upper limbs 5/5. Left lower limb 5/5. Right lower limb 3/5 overall. No clear deficits in tactoalgesic sensitivity. Failure to recognise toes. REM more vivid in the right hemibody. Right extensor CPR, indifferent left. No dysmetria. Paretic gait.

Complementary tests
- CBC: creatinine 1.65 mg/dl GOT 47 IU/l, GPT 59 IU/l. Haemoglobin 12.7 g/dl. All other parameters within normal ranges.
- Electrocardiogram: sinus tachycardia at 100-110 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS with normal axis. Deep S wave in V2-V3. rS in III and aVF. No significant cardiac repolarisation disturbances.
- Cerebrospinal fluid: normal cellularity, proteinorrachia of 60 mg/dl, rest normal, including ADA.
- Study of autoimmunity (ANA, ANCA) and normal hypercoagulability. Cryoglobulins negative.
- Serology negative (syphilis, toxoplasma, PCR HSV 1,2 and varicella) except HIV (undetectable viral load) and HCV (viral load > 4,000,000).
- Bilateral intracranial carotid artery and bilateral vertebral artery arteriography: multiple parietal irregularities and stenosis in the intracranial arteries in their distal segments affecting both anterior and posterior circulation. Also, moderate stenosis in the left P1 segment. Findings compatible with small vessel vasculitis. Arteriography showing parietal irregularities and stenosis of the distal intracranial arteries, compatible with small vessel vasculitis.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT): multiple ischaemic lesions, some with haemorrhagic transformation, territorial and bilateral, in different stages. Cranial CT scan showing large cortical atrophy and multiple bilateral ischaemic lesions in different vascular territories.
- Echocardiography: severe LV hypertrophy with preserved EF.
- Electroencephalogram: bilateral and symmetrical fundamental activity, showing moderate signs of diffuse cerebral involvement. Diagnosis Central nervous system (CNS) HCV vasculitis with negative cryoglobulinaemia in an HIV and HCV positive patient.

Treatment
During his admission, treatment was started with a bolus of cyclophosphamide 750 mg and 3 boluses of 1 g/day of methylprednisolone for 3 days. Despite this, the evolution was torpid.

Evolution
In December 2012, he required a new admission to the Neurology Department due to progression of the pathology. He presented new multiple ischaemic brain lesions and several episodes of acute myocardial ischaemia, receiving conservative medical treatment. Given the patient's poor neurological condition, aggressive treatment for HCV was rejected, which, in addition, being genotype 1b, would have required a more aggressive treatment than usual and with worse results. At present, he is in a very poor clinical condition, with general conservative measures as the only treatment. Although he maintains haemodynamic stability, he is disorientated, he speaks and understands simple commands, cortical blindness, tendency to cephalic deviation to the right, tetraparesis: MSD 2/5, MSI 0/5, MID proximal 0/5, MID distal 3/5, MII proximal 0/5, distal 3/5.
