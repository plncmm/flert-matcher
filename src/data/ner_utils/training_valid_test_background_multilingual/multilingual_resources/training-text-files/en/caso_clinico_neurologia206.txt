Anamnesis
A 25-year-old woman, with no personal history of interest, presented with episodes of hemicranial headache of intensity 9/10 on the VAS scale, associated with nausea and vomiting, lasting for hours, oppressive and sometimes pulsating, which did not subside with first-stage analgesia. He reports some improvement with triptans. On several occasions, the headache was preceded by episodes of slurred speech and numbness of the right arm starting in the hand and moving up the arm, extending to the ipsilateral peribuccal region.

Physical examination
General examination with no pathological findings. Neurological examination: alert, oriented in the three spheres. Fluent language without dysphasic elements, no dysarthria. PICNR. Normal ocular motility. No campimetric defects. No facial asymmetry. Normal lower torques. Strength 5/5 universal. ROT +++/++++ symmetrical. Bilateral flexor RCP. Normal sensibility. No dysmetria. Normal gait.

Complementary tests

- Serology: HIV negative; CMV IgG-, IgM-; EBV IgG+, IgM-; Coxiella burnetti IgG, IgM-, Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG+, Rickettsia typhi IgG-, IgM-, Rickettsia conorii IgG-, IgM-.
- Negative autoimmunity study.
- CSF: normal appearance, clear. Opening pressure 18 cm H2O. Cells 250 leukocytes/ mm3 (90% mononucleated). Glucose: 49.4 mg/dl. Protein: 47.6 mg/dl. Lactate: 1.11 mg/dl. Bacteriological and virus culture negative. Enterovirus PCR negative. CMV IgG-, IgM-; EBV IgG-, IgM-; HSV type 1 and 2 IgG-.
- Brain MRI: normal.
- Arterial and venous MR angiography: normal.
- Electroencephalogram: non-specific.
- Cerebral SPECT (Tc99m): normal.

Diagnosis
In the case of a 25-year-old patient with headache associated with episodes of language and sensory disorders, with CSF pleocytosis, we made the following differential diagnosis:
- Infectious encephalitis due to atypical bacteria or viruses.
- Autoimmune encephalitis.
- Vascular aetiology.
- Epileptic origin.
- Headache syndrome and transient neurological deficits with CSF pleocytosis (HaNDL) or pseudomigraine with pleocytosis. A battery of diagnostic tests was performed, excluding most of the diagnoses listed. The most likely diagnosis was established as headache syndrome and transient neurological deficits with CSF pleocytosis (HaNDL).

Treatment
Analgesic treatment for headache was administered during admission.

Evolution
The patient evolved favourably, the episodes decreased and she did not present new focal neurological symptoms.
