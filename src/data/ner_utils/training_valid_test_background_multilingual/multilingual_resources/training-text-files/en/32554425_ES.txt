A 65-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fever, fatigue and cough of 5 days' duration. Initial blood work showed inflammatory syndrome with high C-reactive protein values (60 mg/L), bicytopenia (normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia) and lymphocytopenia. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward for evaluation. A non-contrast chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacities, characteristic of COVID-19 infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The following day, the patient presented with high fever and chills. A rash was also seen on the lower extremities. Severe hypoxaemia (56 mm Hg) and low oxygen saturation (90.6%) prompted oxygen therapy with a high-concentration mask (15 L/min) and antibiotic therapy (spiramycin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid). As oxygen saturation continued to decrease to 88%, with worsening exanthema and tachypnoea, the patient was admitted to the pneumology intensive care unit.
Rapid pulmonary stabilisation with oxygen was achieved in the intensive care unit; however, the patient remained drowsy despite discontinuation of sedation. CT and MRI of the brain were performed to look for possible neurological complications, such as hypoxic ischaemic lesions or encephalitis. CT showed multiple cerebellar, white matter and basal ganglia hypodensities, as well as bilateral globus pallidus hyperdensities, all indicative of haemorrhage, confirmed on the MRI T2*-weighted sequence.
Brain MRI showed extensive ischaemic lesions, with limited diffusion, involving the semioval centre, corpus callosum, basal ganglia and cerebellum, with patchy/punctate enhancement. A frontal 3D MRA reconstruction of the supra-aortic arteries showed no detectable intra- or extracranial vessel abnormalities.
