Personal History: 36-year-old male. Usual good health. No drug allergies. No usual treatment. Smoker 10 packs/year. Light drinker. Married and an electronics retailer.

Anamnesis: In November 2014, he began with a fever of 38o, no cough, no expectoration, so he went to the Emergency Department and a chest X-ray was performed, which revealed a mass in the right upper lobe (LSD) of the lung.

Physical examination
ECOG 0. Anodyne.

Complementary tests
CBC (15-12-16): CEA 23.1, CA 19.9 199, HIV negative. CT (computed tomography) Chest-abdomen-pelvis (15-12-14): Mass in LSD of 49 mm. Mediastinal right paratracheal, ipsilateral hilar and subcarinal mediastinal adenopathies (10mm). Simple hepatic cysts segments V, VI, VII. Bronchoscopy (16-12-14): Normal. Bronchoaspirate and brushing: Negative CT-guided BAG of LSD mass (22-12-14): Lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR native, ALK translocated by IHC and FISH. PET CT (Positron Emission Tomography) (29-12-14): LSD mass of 3.4x4.6x3.3 cm with SUV 16.32. Right high mediastinal adenopathy 8 mm. SUV 5.15 Prevascular adenopathy 7 mm. SUV 3.05.
High right paratracheal adenopathy 8 mm SUV 4.86, low right paratracheal adenopathy 10 mm SUV 8.01, right hilar adenopathy SUV 5.34. In hepatic segments IV-V hyperactive images with SUV 3.06 and 3.09.
Abdominal ultrasound (02-01-15): Simple hepatic cysts in segments 5 and 6.
Hepatic MRI (07-01-15): Hepatic cysts segments V, VI, VII, VIII.
Echobronchoscopy (12-01-15): adenopathy less than 1 cm in levels 2R with negative puncture, adenopathy 4R positive for adenocarcinoma.
Cranial CT scan (29-01-15): Normal.

Diagnosis
On 26-01-15 he was referred to our service, with a diagnosis of LSD lung adenocarcinoma, T2a-N2-(ipsilateral hilar and mediastinal), M0 Stage III-A. Native EGFR, translocated ALK.

Treatment
We started treatment with CRIZOTINIB 250 mg every 12 hours continuously.

Evolution
After 1 month of treatment, a re-evaluation CT scan was performed (04-03-15) showing a reduction of the LSD mass in the partial response range, complete response of the right paratracheal lymphadenopathy and partial response of the right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. Side effects were visual disturbances in the form of aura, predominantly in the evening. After 2.5 months of treatment with CRIZOTINIB, a PET CT scan was performed (13-04-15): a complete metabolic response of mediastinal and hilar adenopathies with partial response of the tumour was observed. In view of this response, the patient was referred to the Thoracic Surgery Department in Salamanca for surgical assessment following mediastinoscopy. On 28-04-15 mediastinoscopy of levels 4L, 4R and 7 was performed: Negative. On 19-05-15 LSD lobectomy and lymphadenectomy of 4R and 7 by videothoracoscopy: ypT1a (15 mm)- pN0-M0. Complementary radiotherapy is administered (Start 25-08-15/// End 30-09-15) DT 54 Gy in 27 fractions. Side effects: haemoptysis, odynophagia and G-1 dermitis. On 23-02-16 CT TAP was performed: no evidence of disease.
