We present the case of a 37-year-old man from Romania, resident in Spain for 6 years. He smoked about 30 cigarettes/day since he was 15 years old (33 packs/year). He worked in a plastics factory and was diagnosed with silicosis due to occupational exposure to sandblasting. He presented with pulmonary tuberculosis (TBP) 10 years previously treated in his country for six months with a daily regimen containing rifampicin. He came to the emergency department with a fever of 39oC of one week's evolution, dry cough and odynophagia with no other clinical findings on anamnesis by apparatus and systems.

Physical examination: fever, 39oC, BP 130/70 mmHg, HR 112 bpm. RR 12. SatO2 98% at ambient FiO2. No peripheral lymph nodes were palpable. Cardiac auscultation was normal, with no murmurs or friction sounds. Pulmonary auscultation showed generalised hypophonesis without rales. The ED blood test showed 9600 x10e9/L leukocytes, 13.5% monocytes; the rest was normal. Renal function, ionogram and transaminases were normal. CRP 112mg/l.

The ECG showed no relevant alterations. Chest X-ray showed increased cardiothoracic index, nodular image in the left upper lobe and bilateral perihilar interstitial infiltrate. Chest CT revealed progressive massive fibrosis secondary to silicosis with superimposed residual tuberculous fibrotic tracts, infectious involvement of the distal airway and severe pericardial effusion confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography revealing evidence of tamponade.

Differential diagnosis
On admission, the differential diagnosis was established among the causes of pericardial effusion:
- Infectious causes: any microorganism can affect the pericardium.
- Viruses, mainly coxsackievirus. HIV infection should also be considered.
- Bacteria: the most frequently isolated in pericardial fluid are Staphylococcus spp, S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus spp. Less frequent, although to be considered in our patient, is tuberculous pericarditis (PTB). - Others: Rickettsiae, spirochetes, fungi, parasites, Tropheryma whippelii or Chlamydia.
- Neoplastic causes: mainly breast cancer, lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
- Autoimmune causes: the most frequent are systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
- Metabolic causes: uraemic pericarditis, hypothyroidism.
- Other: secondary to acute myocardial infarction, radiation, post-surgical, trauma, pharmacological, chemotherapy.
- Idiopathic: in up to 70% of cases, the aetiology of the effusion may not be established. Most are thought to be viral in origin.

Evolution
A pericardial window was performed, draining 150 ml of sero-sanguinolent fluid with 2380 leukocytes/Î¼l (80% mononuclear) with ADA and glucose levels within normal limits. Given the clinical suspicion of tuberculous pericarditis, treatment was started with four first-line antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) without improvement. The HIV test was negative. Sputum smears and mycobacterial medium culture of four induced sputum samples were negative. Pericardial fluid smear microscopy was negative and mycobacterial culture showed M. tuberculosis resistant to rifampicin (R), isoniazid (I), pyrazinamide (P) and ethambutol (E) as well as to capreomycin and amikacin, and sensitive to other second-line drugs. Treatment was changed to moxifloxacin, prothionamide and linezolid and prednisone 50 mg/day was added. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was maintained for 18 months with good clinical evolution, and the patient was followed up for 24 months without relapse.

Final diagnosis
Tuberculous pericarditis due to multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
