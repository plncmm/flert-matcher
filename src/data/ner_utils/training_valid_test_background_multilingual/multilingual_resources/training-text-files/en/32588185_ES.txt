A 66-year-old Moroccan woman, resident of the Bologna area, was admitted to Imola hospital on 15 March 2020 with hyposthenia in all limbs, more intense in the lower limbs, with a Medical Research Council (MRC) scale score of 1/5 in the distal and 2/5 in the proximal part of the lower limbs, and 3/5 in the distal part and 4/4 in the proximal part of the upper limbs, with a distal tingling sensation and intense low back pain of eight days' evolution. He was unable to walk, reported dysphagia and absent osteotendinous reflexes. Vital signs were normal, medical history was irrelevant and he reported no infection during the previous month. Nerve conduction studies consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were performed, consistent with our hypothesis (protein content 245 mg/dL, cells 13/mmc, polymorphonucleated 61.5%).
CSF microbiological tests were negative (HSV1-2, EBV, VZV, CMV, HIV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia). Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative and ruled out electrolyte abnormalities, heavy metal or drug intoxication, endocrine disorders or folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Blood tests showed elevated creatine kinase (461U/L, normal < 145) and C-reactive protein (5.65mg/dL, normal < 0.5), lymphocytopenia (0.68 × 109/L, normal 1.10-4) and slightly increased LDH (284U/L, normal < 248) and GOT and GPT (549 and 547U/L, normal < 35), similar to laboratory results in patients with COVID-19. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, with a positive result. Increased interleukin 6 (11pg/mL, normal < 5.9) was found, also associated with COVID-19. The patient was transferred to a COVID-19 ward and given a five-day regimen of i.v. immunoglobulin, ritonavir 100mg and darunavir 800mg per day, with hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice daily, according to our hospital's protocol for COVID-19 treatment. She never presented with respiratory symptoms or fever; chest CT was normal.
After Ig administration, the patient improved significantly with a MRC scale score of 4/5 in the distal part of the upper extremities and 3/5 in the proximal and distal parts of the lower extremities, with the appearance of diplegia. About 3 weeks after the onset of neurological symptoms, two nasopharyngeal swabs, taken 24 hours apart, were negative; the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation ward.
