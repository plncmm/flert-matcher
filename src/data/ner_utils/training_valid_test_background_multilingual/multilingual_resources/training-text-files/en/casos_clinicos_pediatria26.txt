REASON FOR CONSULTATION
- A 14-month-old infant came to the emergency department on 15-03-20 due to respiratory distress.
- He had been suffering from catarrhal symptoms for a week with associated bronchospasm on treatment with salbutamol 4 puff every 8 hours. They report increased difficulty in the last few hours.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION
- Fever of 37.7oC with isolated febrile peak of 38oC in the last 48 hours. Some vomiting of mucous content, triggered by coughing. Normal stools.
- Mother in isolation due to direct contact with COVID-19.

PERSONAL HISTORY
- Newborn at term. Normal neonatal period.
- Virus-induced asthma being treated with salbutamol on demand.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
- On arrival at the emergency department, the patient's O2 Sat. O2 of 86% together with tachypnoea and universal tachypnoea. Ta 37.5oC.
- Acceptable general condition. Normal skin and mucosa colouring. No rash or petechiae.
- AP: Acceptable bilateral air entry with scattered subcrepitant.
- Rest of physical examination normal.

COMPLEMENTARY EXPLORATIONS
THORAX X-RAY
Bilateral interstitial infiltrate. Retrocardiac alveolar infiltrate. Free costophrenic sinuses.
- Venous gases: pH 7.36, pCO2 40.4 mmHg, pO2 40.9 mmHg, Bicarbonate 22.7 mmol / L, Exc Base -2.4
- PCR Influenza Virus: NEGATIVE.
- PCR VRS: POSITIVE
Due to COVID-19 epidemic season and mother in contact with positive patient, SARS-CoV-2 PCR is requested.

EVOLUTION
- On arrival, oxygen therapy was administered with a venturi mask at a flow rate of 8 bpm (FiO2 31%), as well as bronchodilator treatment (Salbutamol + Ipratropium Bromide) + Methylprednisolone at 2mg/kg by mouth.
- Hospitalisation was decided due to the need for additional oxygen therapy due to persistent hypoxaemia.
- On admission, routine blood tests showed mild leukocytosis 11310 (5940N 4160L), CRP: 8.7 mg/L, LDH 284, CK 49, GPT 12, glucose 116 and urea 31. In the first 24 hours a NEGATIVE PCR result was obtained for SARS-CoV-2.
- During admission he remained afebrile, on treatment with Ampicillin 200mg/kg/day due to middle lobe infiltrate, as well as bronchodilator treatment (Salbutamol and Ipratropium bromide) in chamber together with methylprednisolone in a descending pattern.
- He required high-flow oxygen therapy (maximum 12 l.p.m. with FiO2 55%) to maintain saturations in range, which could be progressively lowered until discontinued 48 hours before discharge. Discharge on the third day of admission due to good evolution.

DIAGNOSIS
- Moderate asthmatic crisis secondary to RSV infection.
- JMD pneumonia.

TREATMENT
- Salbutamol, with spacer chamber and mask, on demand.
- Paracetamol, if fever.
- Amoxicillin 80mg/kg/day until completing 7 days of treatment.
- Alarm guidelines and information sheet with recommendations are given.
- Telephone monitoring of the evolution of the disease by the primary care paediatrician is indicated.
