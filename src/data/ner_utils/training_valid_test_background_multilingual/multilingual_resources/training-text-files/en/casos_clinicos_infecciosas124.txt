A 67 year old woman who presented with untreated inverse psoriasis and had undergone total knee replacement surgery a year and a half earlier. Three months prior to her admission she presented various dermatological problems consisting of recurrent outbreaks of eczema, folliculitis and int√©rtrigo treated with antihistamines, azithromycin, fluticasone and fusidic acid cream, and irritated actinic keratoses treated with methylprednisolone aceponate cream. One month before admission she presented frequent vaginal discomfort with intense pruritus that she treated empirically with clotrimazole ointment and ointment on suspicion of candidiasis, with very little clinical improvement. A week before her arrival at the emergency department she had a fever of up to 40oC, of 36-48 hours of evolution, with no clear initial focus, but 24 hours after the febrile episode she presented, without previous trauma and at rest, rapidly progressive pain and functional impotence of the left knee with an increase in its circumference. She was seen in the emergency department, where an examination showed clear signs of phlogosis: warmth, erythema and an increase in the circumference of the knee. X-rays showed an increase in the anterior joint space with no involvement of Hoffa's fat or prosthetic mobilisation. Laboratory tests showed lactate 16.1 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 398.9 mg/l, normal renal function, Hb 13 g/dl, leukocytes 13180/mcl with 9710 neutrophils/mcl, platelets 231000/mcl, INR 1.13, AP 82%, APTT 32.9 sec, fibrinogen 1039 mg/dl. Diagnostic and evacuative arthrocentesis was performed, resulting in 50 cc of yellowish cloudy synovial fluid, which was sent to the laboratory for cytobiochemistry and culture.

Differential diagnosis
The patient was a 67-year-old woman with little history of interest, who had undergone total left knee replacement surgery 19 months previously, with no postoperative complications. After an acute, self-limited febrile peak, she presented with local inflammatory signs in the operated knee.
In the differential diagnosis, we must consider the main pathologies that can lead to the development of monoarthritis:
- Arthritis due to microcrystal deposition: the first option to consider in the differential diagnosis due to its frequency of occurrence and its clinical similarity to arthritis of infectious origin (calcium oxalate, calcium pyrophosphate or pseudogout, hydroxyapatite, monosodium urate). Although the coexistence of both entities is an infrequent phenomenon, this possibility must be taken into account.
- Post-traumatic arthritis: ruled out in the absence of previous trauma.
- Haemarthrosis. Rapid onset joint effusion with functional impotence leads us to consider this possibility. However, haemarthrosis is not usually accompanied by fever, unless there is superinfection, and is more common in people with a history of congenital or acquired coagulopathy, recent trauma or anticoagulant treatment, none of these predisposing factors being present in our patient.
- Inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc.). She has a joint effusion with fever; however, the joint fluid is cloudy in appearance and there are no other signs and symptoms to support the possibility of autoimmune disease.
- Infection of prosthetic joint. The patient presents with local inflammatory signs and cloudy joint fluid in the prosthetic knee. Due to the chronology of the infection, we must make a differential diagnosis between a late-onset post-surgical infection or an acute haematogenous infection. The abrupt form of presentation and the accompanying symptoms would support the second option.

Evolution
Biochemical analysis of the synovial fluid showed 123,621 leukocytes/mcl, of which 81% were polymorphonuclear, glucose 1 mg/dl, protein 5.7 g/dl, LDH 4054 U/L. Surgical lavage of the joint cavity with polyethylene replacement was scheduled. Given the clinical stability of the patient on admission and the absence of fever, it was decided to postpone antibiotic treatment to surgery in order to increase the yield of intraoperative cultures. However, the scheduling of the surgery was delayed for several days, due to problems of operating room availability. On previously knowing the results of the culture of the synovial fluid extracted by arthrocentesis, with isolation of S. agalactiae, it was decided to start targeted antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone 2 grams every 24 hours. In the operating theatre, abundant purulent exudate was observed and exhaustive debridement and lavage with abundant saline was performed. Six samples of joint fluid were obtained during surgery and sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from 3 of the 6 intraoperative samples. The Gram stain was positive, showing cocci in chains.
The detailed anamnesis highlighted the history of intense vulvar pruritus secondary to dermal lesions, resistant to the prescribed treatments, which caused scratching lesions. The detailed examination did not find any other possible entry point for the subsequent haematogenous dissemination of the isolated germ, which is common in the vaginal flora. The patient was assessed by gynaecology on admission and a hyperkeratotic lesion was found on the inner face and upper third of both labia majora, compatible with lichen planus. A sample of vaginal exudate was taken for microbiological culture, the result of which was negative.
After surgery, a week of intravenous treatment with ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hours was completed, showing a good clinical evolution and a decrease in acute phase reactants. On discharge, the patient was transferred to oral treatment with amoxicillin 1 g/6 h and rifampicin 600 mg/24 h for a further 7 weeks. Subsequently, the patient was followed up on an outpatient basis, and a good clinical course was observed.

Final diagnosis
Acute haematogenous infection of knee prosthesis secondary to Streptococcus agalactiae bacteraemia of genital origin due to scratching lesions on vulvar eczema.
