A 13-year-old patient with a personal history of pollinosis. After eating salmon, she reported two episodes of choking and chest tightness which subsided after vomiting. Subsequently, lip swelling after eating trout, tolerating the rest of the fish. Allergological study: prick with a battery of aeroallergens and trophoallergens positive for grasses, olive tree, cupressus and profilin. Prick with commercial extract and prick-prick with fish: positive for trout and salmon. Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) 281 U/ml, specific IgE hake, tuna and shrimp <0.35 kU/l. In vitro study: production of complete extracts by freeze-drying of fresh products from cooked/smoked salmon, salmon trout, cooked/raw emperor, pangasius and sea bass. Protein quantification by Bradford method, SDS-PAGE acrylamide gel electrophoresis, Wester Blot, Immunoblotting and Immunodetection.

Results:
After in vitro study, the patient was found to possess specific IgE that recognised bands with an apparent molecular weight between 35 and 40 kDa molecular weight, in salmonid extracts. Salmonid parvalbumin is found in a region around 10-12 kDa. A review of the literature suggests that this may correspond to a region of salmonid enolases and aldolases (40-50 kDa) responsible for recently described monosensitisations to these fish species associated with moderate to severe clinical signs.
