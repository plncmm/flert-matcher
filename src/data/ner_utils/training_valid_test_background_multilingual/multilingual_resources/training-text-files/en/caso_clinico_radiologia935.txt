A 36-year-old male patient with a history of hepatitis C.
Hospitalised for fever and dyspnoea.
 
 
Initial history
Patient was admitted with septic symptoms associated with respiratory distress.
History of IV drug addiction.
As part of the bacteraemia study, an imaging study was performed showing findings compatible with septic embolism.
Coronal reconstruction and axial slices of the CT scan on admission: the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, predominantly peripheral, cavitated, suggestive of septic embolism, was confirmed.

Trans oesophageal echocardiogram showed the presence of vegetation on the tricuspid valve associated with severe regurgitation.

Chest X-ray PA: bilateral parenchymal alveolar filling opacities, some cavitated, more confluent in the right lung base. Mild right pleural effusion. Post-surgical changes of tricuspid valve replacement.

Axial slices and coronal CT reconstruction: Multiple pulmonary nodules, peripheral, bilateral, some cavitated, more clustered in the right lung base. Mild right pleural effusion.

During hospitalisation the patient underwent tricuspid valve replacement surgery.

The patient completed antibiotic treatment, evolved favourably and was discharged with indications for monitoring by the infectious diseases and toxicology team.
