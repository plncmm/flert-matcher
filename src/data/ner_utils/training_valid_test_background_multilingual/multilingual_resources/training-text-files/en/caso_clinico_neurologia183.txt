Anamnesis
A 41-year-old woman with changes in her usual tension headaches for the last 3 months. What she initially described as holocranial and mild became left hemicranial, oppressive and of moderate-severe intensity. They were also associated with pruritus, pain at the slightest tactile stimulus and a tingling sensation in the left hemiface, more accentuated in the fronto-orbital area, with photophobia and sonophobia, as well as less relief with the usual analgesia (ibuprofen and paracetamol) and blurred vision in the temporal hemifield of the left eye. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in the emergency department, showing no alterations, and an outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain was performed in another centre shortly after the onset of the described symptoms, which was reported as normal. Given the frequency of the headaches, treatment was started with amitriptyline with clinical improvement in the following month, although the allodynia and facial pruritus persisted.

She came to the emergency department again due to an increase in the intensity of the left hemicranial pain in the last 2 weeks with a score of 8 on the visual analogue scale (VAS). She describes it as throbbing, associated with photophobia and sonophobia, although what most incapacitates her is the pruritus and hypersensitivity of the periorbital and left frontoparietal area. She feels an intense stinging sensation to small tactile stimuli, making it impossible for her to rest her head on this area. The decrease in visual acuity in the left temporal hemifield progressed to absolute loss of vision in this eye (she could not even distinguish light or shadows). In addition, he reported difficulty seeing normally in the right temporal hemifield and pain with eye movements. He denied nausea, vomiting, worsening of the headache with Valsalva manoeuvres or interference with sleep. He denied fever or other infectious symptoms, as well as recent travel. She denied sphincter alteration. The patient recalled that, coinciding with the onset of the headache and visual symptoms, she had felt numbness in the breast and left brachial region for several weeks, which resolved spontaneously and completely.

Physical examination
Amaurosis of the left eye. Visual acuity of 0.8/1 in the right eye with temporal hemianopsia and dyschromatopsia. Relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Pupil of the right eye reactive. Normal fundus. Extrinsic ocular movements preserved, without restrictions, although she reported pain when moving the left eye. Allodynia in the theoretical territory of the left first trigeminal branch (V1). Hypoaesthesia in the left C2-C4 territory. Rest normal.

Complementary tests
- Blood count, haemostasis, liver profile, lipid profile, renal profile, ions, acute phase reactants, hormones (TSH, T4) and vitamins (B12, A, E, D, folic acid) normal.
- Immunochemistry: slight increase in IgM (339 mg/dl, normal range 49-302), rest normal. No oligoclonal bands in serum.
- Normal autoimmunity study.
- Serum serology (HBV, HCV, syphilis, Borrelia, Brucella, HIV, cryptococcal antigen) negative.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): biochemistry with slightly increased protein (37 mg/dl, normal range 10-30) without cells. ADA negative. Albumin quotient and IgG index normal. No oligoclonal bands detected in CSF. Serology (syphilis, Borrelia, Brucella, cryptococcus) negative.
- Cervical spine MRI: signal alteration in the T2 sequence in the cervical spinal cord at levels C1-C2 located mainly in the right posterior cord region and left lateral region compatible with demyelinating lesion. Cervical MRI, T2 sequence, longitudinal section showing hyperintensity at the C1-2 level, compatible with demyelinating lesion.
- Brain MRI: anomalous hyperintensity in FLAIR sequences affecting the intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve on the left side in its posterior portion and extending to the chiasm, with extension towards the left side. Brain magnetic resonance imaging FLAIR sequence, coronal section. Hyperintensity in the optic chiasm is visualised.
- Visual evoked potentials (VEP): no response with stimulus from the left eye. Normal in the right eye.
- Positive anti-quaporin 4 (anti-NMO) antibodies.

Diagnosis
Autoimmune neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease).

Treatment
After administration of 1 g methylprednisolone daily for 7 days and six sessions of plasmapheresis the patient experienced a complete improvement of visual acuity in the right eye. However, with the left eye she was only able to distinguish light and shadow. She was discharged with azathioprine 50 mg every 12 hours and topiramate 50 mg every 24 hours.

Evolution
In the following 6 months she required admission on two occasions for blurred vision in the right eye, again requiring several cycles of methylprednisolone with complete resolution of the symptoms in that eye. Vision in the left eye remained similar to the first admission, with only light and shadow distinction. The allodynia and headaches improved with an increase in the dose of topiramate and the reintroduction of amitriptyline, without completely disappearing, pending assessment by the Pain Unit.
