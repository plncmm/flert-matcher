28-year-old woman, who reported allergy to penicillin studied in childhood by the Allergology Service, with intradermal test. She had no other known medical or surgical history of interest. She denied toxic habits. She did not take treatment on a regular basis.
She consulted her primary care physician for symptoms of odynophagia of 10 days' evolution and self-palpation of the cervical lymph nodes. Examination revealed hypertrophic tonsils with whitish exudate, and treatment was started with oral corticotherapy (deflazacort 30 mg per day) and empirical oral antibiotherapy with clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. After 48 hours, the patient went to the emergency department for worsening general condition, presenting fever up to 39.7oC, dry cough, dyspnoea and right costal pain with pleuritic characteristics. On arrival the patient was febrile (38.3o), hypotensive (84/40 mmHg), tachycardic (120 bpm) and tachypneic (30 rpm). On examination she presented: cardiopulmonary auscultation with rhythmic tachycardic tones and good vesicular murmur with dry bibasal crackles; abdomen and lower extremities without findings.
The otorhinolaryngological examination showed hypertrophic tonsils with a slight whitish exudate and multiple cervical adenopathies of 1-2 cm, not attached to deep planes, painful and mobile. There were no pathological findings in the dental pieces on examination. The complementary tests requested in the emergency department showed the following results: haemoglobin 10.7 mg/dl, leucocytes 47,000/ul, with 44,120 absolute neutrophils and platelets 160,000/uL.
The smear showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia at the expense of mature elements with significant toxic granulation and the presence of a few cysts. No platelet aggregates. Coagulation with INR 1.4 with times within normality. Renal function with Cr 0.7 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to CKD-EPI of 105.90 ml/min/1.73 m2, and normal ions, normal abdominal profile (Bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL), CRP 337 mg/L, procalcitonin 58.4 mg/L. Venous blood gas analysis showed pH 7.34, pO2 61 mmHg, pCO2 35 mmHg, HCO3- 19 mE/L, lactic acid 2.7 mosm/L. Chest X-ray showed normal cardiothoracic index and bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate (Chest X-ray: reticulonodular infiltrate in both bases and pulmonary nodules in LSD) and abdominal ultrasound showed right pleural effusion in discrete quantity and an image suggestive of consolidation in the lower lobe of the right lung.

Differential diagnosis
In view of the data obtained in the anamnesis and the complementary tests requested in the emergency department, we considered severe sepsis of otorhinolaryngological/respiratory origin as a syndromic diagnosis, with the following diagnostic possibilities:
- Streptococcal tonsillitis complicated with:
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, this could be considered due to the aggressiveness of the picture, however the absence of cutaneous involvement leads us to doubt this picture, as less than 20% present without such involvement.
- Septic thrombophlebitis or Lemierre's syndrome: factors in favour include a septic picture in the context of possible tonsillitis, the presence of respiratory symptoms (cough and dyspnoea).
- However, for the moment we did not have enough complementary tests, nor a decisive semiology in the cervical examination, to confirm that the patient had a jugular vein thrombosis.
- Ludwig's angina, practically ruled out due to the presentation of the picture and the absence of inflammatory signs in the floor of the mouth and submaxillary region.
- Plaut-Vincent's angina, initially we cannot rule it out, despite the otorhinolaryngological examination described above, as no ulceronecrotic lesion with formation of membranes can be seen.
- Mononucleosis syndrome is considered in the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, odynophagia and tonsillar hypertrophy; however, the intense leukocytosis at the expense of neutrophils would make this diagnosis difficult, unless it is a possible superinfection.
- Community-acquired pneumonia, in principle we would be faced with a mixed profile, atypical due to the absence of clear radiological consolidation, dry cough without expectoration, and typical due to high fever and neutrophilic leukocytosis.

Evolution
On arrival at the hospital ward, empirical treatment with clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours) had already been started in the emergency department, given the patient's history of allergy to penicillins. The patient was in septic shock, with BP 90/40 mmHg, HR 120 bpm and tachypnoea of 30 breaths per minute. She was assessed by the Bacteraemia Programme team, who added clindamycin (600 mg every 6 hours IV) and requested an urgent cervico-thoracic CT scan, showing a left parapharyngeal abscess associated with thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein (cervical CT c/c. left parapharyngeal abscess associated with thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein). left parapharyngeal abscess and thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein) as well as bilateral cavitated pulmonary nodules compatible with septic embolism, associated with bilateral pleural effusion, which was drained, obtaining pleural fluid compatible with empyema (chest CT scan: bilateral septic emboli and image of pleural effusion predominantly on the right), with the placement of pleural drainage tubes. After 48 hours of incubation, results of complementary microbiological tests were received. Blood culture isolated Fusobacterium spp, pending definitive identification and antibiogram. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigenuria was negative. Sputum culture was also negative for bacteria and mycobacteria. Serology for pneumonia, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetti and respiratory viruses was negative, as well as for Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, hepatitis A, B, C virus, rubella and human immunodeficiency virus. In view of these data (CT scan and blood culture), as well as the absence of clinical improvement, presenting hypoxaemic respiratory failure and hypotension refractory to fluid therapy, an assessment was requested from the Intensive Care Unit, which decided to admit him to the ICU.
During his stay in the ICU, tonsillectomy and abscess drainage were performed by the Otorhinolaryngology Department and assessment by the Allergy Department, which performed skin tests with major and minor determinants of benzylpenicillin sodium, with negative results. Following this, a controlled exposure test with penicillin was performed, and combined antibiotic treatment was started with peciniline (4 MU every 4 hours) and clindamycin (600mg every 6 hours IV), methylprednisolone (40mg every 8 hours IV) and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin SC (60 mg every 12 hours).
No vasoactive amines were required. The definitive results of the blood cultures were received, which reported isolation of Fusobacterium necrophorum sensitive to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, and metronidazole; and the pleural fluid culture, which was negative. After these therapeutic measures, the patient improved progressively without requiring mechanical ventilation or vasoactive amines. A control cervico-thoracic CT scan was performed with a favourable radiological response, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases hospital ward.
Laboratory and radiological controls were carried out and showed an improvement in the condition, despite the persistence of residual lesions in the form of smaller pulmonary nodules and chronic thrombosis of the left jugular vein. Given the clinical stability of the patient, hospital discharge was decided on day +20 of admission, with home treatment with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for a further 2 weeks, deflazacort 30 mg in a descending pattern, enoxaparin 60 mg every 12 hours. The patient was reviewed in the outpatient infectious diseases department 2 weeks after hospital discharge, where clinical improvement was observed, with virtual disappearance of the odynophagia and normalisation of the haemogram and acute phase reactants.

Final diagnosis
Lemierre's syndrome with the presence of peritonsillar and parapharyngeal abscess complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein and bilateral pulmonary septic embolisms and pleural empyema.
