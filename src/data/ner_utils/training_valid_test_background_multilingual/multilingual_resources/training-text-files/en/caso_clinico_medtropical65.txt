Previously healthy female patient aged 1 year and 11 months, resident of the conurbation area of the city, with a history of living in overcrowded conditions, who attended the hospital in May. The parents reported that, since birth, she had had close contact with animals, specifically dogs and cats, which did not receive preventive treatment against ticks and were frequently parasitised by them.

The illness began with acute hyperthermia, which persisted for 3 days, of an intermittent type with peaks of up to 38.8 oC, accompanied by generalised macular exanthema. On the third day, diffuse colicky abdominal pain was added, which, due to its intensity, warranted admission to the second level of medical care for examination. During the first hours of his stay, he presented complex partial seizures, secondarily generalised for 40 minutes, so the airway was secured by endotracheal intubation and impregnation with diphenylhydantoin, diazepam and cisatracurium was started. A central venous catheter was installed and the patient was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).

The patient was admitted to the PICU in poor general condition, with evidence of septic shock and low cardiac output manifested by arterial hypotension below the 5th percentile for her age, tachycardia, anuria, distal hypoperfusion, delayed capillary refill, weak central pulses and non-palpable peripheral pulses. The patient also presented petechial and purpuric lesions on the abdomen and upper and lower extremities and distal ischaemia in the fingers, reflecting a vasculitic process.

During his stay, he was maintained on sedation-controlled mechanical ventilation and analgesia with fentanyl/midazolam, meropenem/vancomycin schedule adjusted to renal impairment, crystalloid solution loading at 20 ml/kg/day, acute bicarbonate correction to base deficit, inotropic support with milrinone/dobutamine/levisomendan, norepinephrine as a systemic vasopressor, hydrocortisone infusion for management of refractory shock, and heparin infusion for management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Blood gases were obtained and showed decompensated metabolic acidosis, with venous saturation of 49% and a central venous pressure (CVP) reading of 14 cmH2O. Paraclinical tests showed impending organ failure, with renal and hepatic compromise, as well as marked leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, so 10 ml/kg of fresh plasma and 2 platelet concentrates were administered.

Due to the patient's history and clinical condition, a diagnosis of rickettsiosis was requested from our Institute. This was carried out by means of indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) positive 1:128 for R. rickettsii antigens circulating in our environment, together with amplification and sequencing of the OmpB gene, which resulted in 98% homology to R. rickettsii, as well as nested amplification of the 17 kDa gene. Shortly after 24 hours of admission and before 6 hours in the PICU, the patient presented signs of septic shock secondary to multiple organ failure, DIC and cardiorespiratory arrest that did not respond to advanced resuscitation manoeuvres and died. The serological diagnosis was obtained hours before the patient's death, while the molecular diagnosis was obtained post mortem.
