He suffered a progressive abandonment of his hygienic-dietary care and notable social isolation, even considering death as something desirable "he saw people die and thought that this was a way of resting".

Clinical course
During his hospitalisation, treatment with Escitalopram and Lorazepam was gradually started. There was a progressive improvement in her mood, with good adaptation to the dynamics of the unit and to home leave. The patient was totally critical of the suicidal ideation, verbalising coherent, realistic and adaptive plans for the short and medium term, centred on family life and work. She accepts the convenience of continuing treatment on an outpatient basis. Given the good evolution, hospital discharge was decided 20 days after admission, in agreement with the patient and his family. Follow-up at CSMA with good evolution.
