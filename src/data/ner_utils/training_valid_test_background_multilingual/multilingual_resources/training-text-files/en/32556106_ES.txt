A 51-year-old man reported fever, arthromyalgia, dyspnoea and atypical chest pain, but without cough or anosmia/ageusia. Troponin I values were 200 ng/mL, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 900 pg/mL, C-reactive protein 270 mg/L and fibrinogen > 10 g/L. ECG showed non-specific T-wave changes. Echocardiogram yielded no relevant findings. Acute myocarditis was suspected. Two PCR tests for COVID-19 from nasopharyngeal swabs were performed at an interval of 48 hours, together with a chest CT scan, and in both cases the result was negative for COVID-19. Serological tests showed previous infections with parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus. Other tests were negative (HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, Coxsackie, HSV1, HSV2, VZV, RSV and influenza virus). Cardiac MRI 8 days after symptom onset showed subepicardial oedema in the lateral/inferior left ventricular (LV) wall, with late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with acute myocarditis. A radiocinematography showed maintenance of LVEF and volumes, no alterations in wall motion but a 5 mm thrombus was seen at the LV tip. The atypical finding of a thrombus despite an unaltered LVEF and clear biological signs of inflammation were assessed as rare and therefore serological testing for COVID-19 was performed. The results were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. The patient was treated with tocilizumab.
