A 64-year-old man, ex-smoker, with hypertension and severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, presented to our emergency department with dry cough, dyspnoea and hyperthermia of 4 days' evolution. Clinical examination was normal except for a temperature of 37.3 oC. Laboratory tests showed increased fibrinogen, D-dimer and C-reactive protein. Chest X-ray showed unilobular interstitial opacities in the right upper lobe. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was initiated and the patient was discharged 48 h later. During outpatient follow-up, the patient presented chest X-ray with extensive pulmonary opacities, lymphocytopenia and a significant increase in C-reactive protein, so he was readmitted and, to the previous treatment, methylprednisolone and a single 600 mg dose of tocilizumab were added (day 4 from the first ED visit). All markers of inflammation improved, but D-dimer increased significantly to 4640μg/L, so that 7 days after admission (day 11 from symptom onset), a CT scan was performed to look for acute pulmonary oedema (ALE), which showed a floating thrombus in the mid-segment of the descending aorta. Treatment with LMWH at an antithrombotic dose was initiated. On a follow-up CT angiography 17 days later, no aortic thrombus was found.
