A 42-year-old woman consulted the emergency department for the third time with a fever of up to 38-5oC, fluctuating, with no clear morning or evening predominance, for 17 days, preceded by abdominal pain for a month in the mesogastrium and epigastrium with increased bowel habit for several months, presenting diarrhoeal stools with mucus, as well as arthralgia. Ten days earlier she had started treatment with Levofloxacin without improvement. Her medical history included ex-smoking 19 packs/year for 8 years, a history of sinusitis, extrinsic rhinitis-asthma due to sensitisation to pollens. In January 2013, she was admitted to Internal Medicine for community-acquired left lower lobe pneumonia with minimal associated pleural effusion, with peripheral eosinophilia that had persisted up to the time of this consultation. Physical examination revealed pain on deep palpation of the mesogastrium with no signs of peritoneal irritation, and the rest of the examination was unremarkable. During her stay in the emergency department, urgent laboratory tests were requested, showing a CRP 111.2 mg/l; eosinophilia of 1,200 (18.5%), and she was admitted to the internal medicine ward with fever under study and eosinophilia. On arrival at the ward, the patient continued with febrile peaks, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, beginning with asthmatic decompensation. Full laboratory tests were requested from the ward, showing frank eosinophilia of 6200 (50.4%), elevated CRP of 108.7 mg/l, rheumatoid factor of 591.8 IU/mL, tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, CA 125, CA 15.3; CA19. 9; CEA) with CA 125 elevated 193.7 U/ml; Autoimmunity with ANAs, ENAs, ANCAs and Antiphospholipid Ac. which were normal, as well as serology for Salmonella, Brucella, Coxiella burnetii; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Rickettsia conorii all negative. Given the patient's personal history, clinical and laboratory findings, the following differential diagnoses were made: infection by parasites; haematological disease such as eosinophilic syndrome, lymphoma (Hodking, non-Hodking), leukaemia or mastocytosis; gastrointestinal disease such as eosinophilic gastroenteritis and Churg-Strauss disease. To continue the study, an IgE determination was requested, which was 325, a peripheral blood smear showed absolute eosinophilia, with no atypical cells; a stool study was carried out, which ruled out the presence of parasites. Simultaneously, a CT scan of the sinuses-thorax-abdomen was requested, which showed sinupathy, small pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion with lower lobe atelectasis and colitis with a moderate amount of free abdominal fluid. To complete the study, invasive tests such as paracentesis, gastro-colonsoccopy and nasofibroscopy were performed, from which samples were obtained for both microbiology and pathological anatomy. While the study was being carried out, the patient began treatment with corticotherapy and antibiotic coverage with Ceftriaxone, with improvement of the digestive symptoms and pleural effusion. The microbiology results were obtained and ruled out the presence of pathogens in the samples received; however, the pathological anatomy confirmed the presence of eosinophils in all the samples received. The results of the differential diagnoses ruled out the presence of parasitosis and haematological disease. The presence of eosinophilic gastroenteritis was confirmed, which, together with the patient's personal history, strengthened the diagnosis of Churg Strauss disease, which according to the ACR criteria:
- Asthma.
- Eosinophilia greater than 10% in the differential white blood cell count.
- Development of mono-polyneuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy (glove/sock distribution) attributable to systemic vasculitis.
- Migratory or transient pulmonary infiltrates on Rx (not including fixed infiltrates) attributable to systemic vasculitis.
- Sinus abnormality: History of acute or chronic paranasal pain or hypersensitivity to touch or radiological sinus opacification.
- Extravascular eosinophilia. Biopsy including arteries, arterioles or venules showing accumulation of eosinophils in extravascular areas.
- Of which the patient fulfilled 5 of the 6 criteria, so after clinical improvement the patient was discharged with the following diagnosis:
- Churg-Strauss disease in eosinophilic phase.
- She continued treatment with Dacortin 30mg daily with a gradual decrease to 20 mg, which was maintained.
- The patient continues with check-ups and recently started treatment with immurel for asthmatic exacerbations and abdominal pain.
