A 37 year old woman came to the emergency department with fever of 39oC and pain in the right hypochondrium. Examination revealed significant hepatomegaly. Blood tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased acute phase reactants. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed three space-occupying lesions in the liver, hypoechogenic and with poorly demarcated contours, which displaced the vessels in the vicinity. In view of these findings, an abdominopelvic CT scan was performed with three-phase intravenous contrast, showing the aforementioned hepatic lesions, which were characterised as abscesses. In addition, distension of the endometrial cavity due to liquid content with enhancement of the endometrium and a hypodense tubular structure in the right adnexal region with enhancement of its wall were identified. Subsequently, transvaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of right pyosalpinx.

The patient was diagnosed with liver abscesses secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease. Ultrasound-guided drainage of the more peripheral liver abscesses was performed and the culture of the material obtained was positive for Actinomyces israelii.
