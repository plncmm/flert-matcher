A 54-year-old man was referred to the Oncology Unit of the Hospital Virgen Macarena with the main diagnosis of posterior uveitis. Infectious aetiology was ruled out due to negative laboratory data and the absence of data suggestive of systemic disease. A lesion was observed in the posterior pole of the right eye.
The patient was treated four times with antiangiogenic drugs (anti-VEGF; bevacizumab) before being referred to our centre.
As family history, he refers to his mother with tongue cancer and his father with stomach cancer and, in terms of personal history, only dyslipidaemia.
As complementary tests of interest, we have a normal haemogram and biochemistry (NL), except for the referred dyslipidaemia, erythrocyte sedimentation volume 9, negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (-), Toxocara cani (-), Borrelia (-), syphilis: negative, Mantoux (-). X-ray: normal. Computed axial tomography of the skull/orbits, with and without contrast: normal. Tumour markers (-), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, human leukocyte antigen-B/angiotensin converting enzyme: normal or negative.

Ophthalmological examination:
- Visual acuity (VA): right eye (RA): 0.05/left eye: 0.9. He reported a decrease in VA, despite suffering from amblyopia of the right eye.
- Biomicroscopy of the anterior pole: anterior pole without pathological signs. Clear cornea and lens, Tyndall (-), normal intrinsic and extrinsic ocular motility.
- Fundus: slightly raised lesion in the posterior pole of the OD with a haemorrhagic and vascular component on its surface.
- Intraocular pressure: 16/16 mmHg.
- Optical coherence tomography (OCT): retinal lesion of dense consistency without cysts or presence of subretinal fluid compatible with retinal hamartoma.
- Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A): lesion compatible with an arcuate capillary haemangioma involving the posterior pole. The afferent and efferent vessels are visualised in the superficial layers and there is a shadow compatible with artefacts in the avascular layers2. We performed OCT-A using Triton OCT, swept source OCT-A3.

Diagnosis: solitary retinal capillary haemangioma in the inferior temporal arch with no associated systemic disease.

Treatment: the lesion was treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) on four occasions plus post-treatment A-VEGF (aflibercept) one week after each session, with two-month intervals between treatments, with improvement of VA (January, March, May, July). Their activity was reduced and, as a consequence, exudation was reduced. Vision improved from 0.05 to 0.2, which, given the patient's previous amblyopia, is a significant improvement. He currently remains under observation.
