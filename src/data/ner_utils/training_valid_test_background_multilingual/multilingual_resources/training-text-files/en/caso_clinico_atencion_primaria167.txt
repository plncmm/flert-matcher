Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Family and Community Approach
The patient lives with a caregiver and has 8 children who visit him frequently. Among his children there is no agreement regarding the patient's care, as they have not all assimilated the prognosis of his disease in the same way. He was last admitted 1 month ago for sepsis of urinary origin. Since discharge, we have made scheduled home visits every 2 days due to his high comorbidity and the presence of frequent pyuria every time he finishes a course of antibiotics, in order to prevent further complications. The patient had deteriorated after admission but had an acceptable quality of life and remained clinically stable. His family was very demanding in terms of the patient's medical care.

Clinical judgement (list of problems, referral diagnosis)
Upper respiratory tract cold.

Action plan
We started treatment with acetylcysteine and paracetamol, in addition to maintaining his inhalers. We assessed the patient again the following day when one of his daughters phoned us to report a lack of improvement. When we went to assess him, we found no change from the previous day. He still had no fever.

Evolution
The morning after our second visit, the patient began to run a fever and his family decided to take him to hospital for assessment.
Several complementary tests were performed. Blood tests showed Hb 11.5 g/dl; Leukocytes 20000; Neutrophils 94%; Platelets 520000; Creatinine 4,895 mg/dl; Urea 186 mg/dl; Sodium 120 mEq/L; Potassium 6, 2 mEq/L (haemolyzed serum). Chest X-ray showed a condensation image in the upper third of the right hemithorax. Influenza PCR was negative for influenza A and B.
In view of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and admitted to the observation area. He had a poor evolution during the next 24 hours after admission, with a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and increased work of breathing. The family was warned of the poor short-term prognosis and he eventually died.
The next day one of his daughters called us at the surgery to tell us the news. She was angry and reproached us for not having noticed the condition earlier. We told her how upset we were about the development and tried to be sympathetic to the situation. However, we could not help but be left with a very bad feeling about what had happened given the extensive attention and dedication we had given to the patient when it was necessary.
