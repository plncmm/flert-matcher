On 1 February 2020, a 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency department reporting a fever of 7 days' duration, with a maximum temperature of 38.7°C, coughing, slight expectoration and myalgia, but no chest discomfort or dyspnoea. He had flown back to Hangzhou (China) from Malaysia 7 days earlier. Physical examination revealed no dry or moist rales in both lungs and a temperature of 37.3°C, pulse 92 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm and blood pressure 113/79 mmHg. Laboratory tests gave a white blood cell count of 2.5 x 109 cells/mL, with 63.3% neutrophils and 29.2% lymphocytes; the C-reactive protein value was 3.62 mg/L. Sputum tests for influenza A+B (by real-time RT-PCR) were negative. Lung CT scans of the patient showed several ground-glass shadows with diffuse borders and irregular densities in the peripheral and posterior areas of the lungs, mainly subpleural. These images were consistent with previous radiological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Further, real-time fluorescence RT-PCR testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.
