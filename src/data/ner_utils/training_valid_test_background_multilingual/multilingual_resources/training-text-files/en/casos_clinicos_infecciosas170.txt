The case is presented of a 37-year-old male of African origin, who has been living in Spain for 10 years. He consulted for abdominal pain of 3 weeks' evolution, fever/febrile fever and increased abdominal perimeter.
On examination, good general condition, with BP 110/70 mmHg, HR of 110 spm and Ta of 37.8 oC. The abdomen was painful to diffuse palpation, with non-tension ascites. No other findings of interest.
Among the complementary studies, analytical profiles were normal except for GPT 62 U/l, CPK 1695 U/l, CRP 177 mg/l, ESR 100 mm/h, haemoglobin 114 g/l, relative neutrophilia 67% without leukocytosis, fibrinogen 7.5 g/l and INR 1.4. Abdominal ultrasound showed homogeneous splenomegaly and abundant free fluid without other alterations. Paracentesis was performed and biochemistry showed 2214 cells/mm3 (95% mononuclear), protein 59 g/L, ADA 154 mU/mL, LDH 728 mU/mL, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 8.8 g/L. Blood cultures, urine cultures, smear microscopy and sputum culture were negative. Chest and abdominal X-rays were normal and CT scan with intravenous c/c of the abdomen showed diaphragmatic and mesenteric adenopathy, abundant intraperitoneal fluid, enhancement of peritoneal sheets and infiltration of the greater omentum.

Differential diagnosis
This is a patient of African origin, but taking into account that the most frequent cause of ascites is due to portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis (80% frequency), multiple aetiologies must be ruled out due to their prevalence, as well as other less frequent but possible causes due to the patient's origin and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics:

Portal hypertension:
- Cirrhosis (80% of all cases of ascites).
- Acute alcoholic hepatitis: may be due to underlying portal hypertension due to cirrhosis or transient portal venous obstruction, together with the associated state of malnutrition.
- Acute liver failure: all causes of acute fulminant hepatitis can trigger ascites.
- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (Budd- Chiari syndrome): obstruction due to thrombosis of at least 2 of the 3 suprahepatic veins.
- Heart failure.
- Constrictive pericarditis: decreased venous return can trigger ascites due to congestion.

Hypoalbuminaemia:
- Nephrotic syndrome.
- Protein-losing enteropathy.
- Severe malnutrition. 

Peritoneal pathology:
- Ascites due to malignancy (gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer...): very difficult to diagnose as it presents in a very similar way to other pathologies, its main characteristics will be reviewed in the discussion.
- Infectious peritonitis:
- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: it should be ruled out in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
- Secondary bacterial peritonitis (covert perforation): due to perforation of the hollow viscera, the characteristics of the ascitic fluid would be different, with high cellularity and predominance of PMN, and the presentation would be much more acute.
- Peritoneal tuberculosis: given the origin and form of presentation, it is very likely, but other causes must be excluded.
- Fungal peritonitis: especially in patients on renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis, which is not our case.
- Parasites: exceptionally, but given the patient's origin, they should be taken into account (hydatidosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis...) although it is very characteristic for it to present with eosinophilic ascites.
- Primary mesothelioma. Systemic eosinophilias: Systemic pathologies with severe organ involvement that can lead to liver infiltration such as hypereosinophilic syndromes, Churg-Strauss syndrome, etc. They would present with eosinophilia in LA. 

Inflammatory/Autoimmune:
It is necessary to rule out inflammatory and autoimmune pathology, which may course with serositis:
- Autoinflammatory syndromes: familial Mediterranean fever, cryopyrinopathies, periodic syndromes associated with anti-TNF receptor.... A high index of suspicion is required, as ascites due to serositis is rare.
- Autoimmune diseases: SLE (rare), rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis and chronic cholestasis (primary biliary cirrhosis and primary cholangitis in cirrhosis phase, etc. other causes: Sarcoidosis (rare form of presentation), chylous ascites (milky ascitic fluid, predominantly trglycerides), pancreatic ascites (elevated amylase), myxedema, haemoperitoneum, urological damage....

Evolution
During the patient's hospitalisation, a new paracentesis is performed (800 ml), with similar ascitic fluid; this ascitic fluid is centrifuged and cultured. After 14 days of hospitalisation, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with biopsies taken for culture and pathological anatomy. The laparoscopic report showed massive adhesive symptoms, miliary granules in the parietal and visceral peritoneum and omentum, with considerable ascites, compatible with tuberculous peritonitis.
The pathological anatomy reports necrotising granulomatous inflammation and the biopsy culture is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Lowenstein medium, without resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin, with positive PCR; the ascitic fluid centrifugation culture grows the same species, with negative PCR. Treatment was started with 4 drugs and prednisone, with excellent evolution and resolution of symptoms.

Final diagnosis
Tuberculous peritonitis.
