A 27-year-old male presented with fever and haemoptysis. His personal history included two episodes of bilateral pneumonia in the last year, with clinical resolution and radiological improvement after conventional treatment, although with persistent left alveolar infiltrate on control chest X-rays.

He has no HIV risk factors or immunosuppression. He works as a mechanic in contact with environments where welding, grease, acids and other irritants are used.

Physical examination, laboratory tests and respiratory function tests were normal.

A chest X-ray was performed which revealed a bilateral alveolar infiltrate similar to the previous X-rays. It was then decided to perform a high-resolution computed tomography scan of the thorax with high-resolution slices, consisting of 1 mm thin slices at 10 mm intervals of the lung parenchyma, in inspiration and with the patient in the supine decubitus position. The study shows areas of scattered ground-glass alveolar opacification with superimposed linear smooth inter- and intralobular septal thickening, known as 'crazy-paving' or cobblestone pattern, with extensive scattered and patchy involvement of the left lung as well as perihilar and middle lobe on the right side.

Taking into account the radiological pattern on HRCT and exposure to inhaled toxic agents, the differential diagnosis is reduced to PAP and lipoid pneumonia.

Fibrobronchoscopy was performed with BAL, which was inconclusive, and was completed with a transbronchial biopsy; the ultrastructural study identified PAS-positive eosinophilic amorphous granular material in the interior of the alveoli and some lipophage with microvacuoles in the alveolar wall, leading to the diagnosis of PAP.
