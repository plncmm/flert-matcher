A 9 year old boy. In May he presented an episode of anaphylaxis (urticaria, facial angioedema, hand oedema and respiratory difficulty) while playing in a rose garden and 3 hours after having eaten loin with cheese and cherry "which did not agree with him". At the health centre he was given intravenous methylprednisolone and dexchlorpheniramine, and the symptoms subsided.

Since childhood, after contact with peach and Paraguayan peel, he had oedema and erythema in the area of contact. He had not been studied in paediatric allergy. No rhinoconjunctival symptoms in spring or bronchospasm crisis.

Prick skin tests positive for grasses and olive tree, peach, cherry and LTP skin. Specific IgE: peach class 3, pru p3 7.08 kU/L moderate level, cherry 3.75 kU/L moderate level, olive class 1, dactylis glomerata class 5, phleum pratense class 4, cynodon dactylo class 2.

Given the severity of the symptoms, it was recommended to avoid eating rosaceous fruits and an adrenaline auto-injector was indicated. No new symptoms.

The patient suffered anaphylaxis due to ingestion of cherry plus other coadjuvant factors (area of rose bushes, spring).

He presented primary sensitisation to other rose fruits with sensitisation to lipid transporter protein (LTP), indicating the possibility of a severe systemic reaction.

After study, hypersensitivity to grass pollen was demonstrated, as is usual in clinical cases with fruits of the rosaceae family.

Episode of anaphylaxis, although resolved satisfactorily, the first line of treatment recommended in clinical guidelines, intramuscular adrenaline, was not prescribed. Training should continue at all levels of health care for the correct treatment of these cases.
