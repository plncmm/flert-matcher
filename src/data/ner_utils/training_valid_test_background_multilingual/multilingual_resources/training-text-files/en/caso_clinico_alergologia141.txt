A 5-month-old boy was seen in the emergency department on 2 occasions for vomiting, poor general condition, decreased level of consciousness, hypotonia and skin pallor lasting 30 minutes, which started 2 hours after eating gluten-free cereal porridge. During the first episode, blood tests, cranial CT scan and lumbar puncture were performed, and the patient was admitted with IV acyclovir.

A 5-month-old boy was assessed twice in 10 days for episodes of vomiting, pallor and hypotonia. In both episodes he had eaten gluten-free cereal porridge which he had previously tolerated on one occasion.

In both cases, skin tests and specific IgE to cereals were negative. Provocation to cereals with gluten and without rice with negative results, so they were diagnosed with rice-induced enterocolitis.

A 5-month-old female brought to the emergency department for vomiting after 2 hours of first ingestion of porridge with gluten-free cereals. Complete resolution of the symptoms on arrival at the emergency department and she was discharged. Provocation with gluten-free cereals, presenting 2 hours after ingestion with skin pallor, hypotonia and decay. Same symptoms after provocation with cereals containing gluten (without rice). Provocation with corn negative. Pending further study.
