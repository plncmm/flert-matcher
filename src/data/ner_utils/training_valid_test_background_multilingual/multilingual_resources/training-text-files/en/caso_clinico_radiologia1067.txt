A 62-year-old male patient, farmer, previously healthy, resident of the province of Santiago del Estero, was admitted to the emergency room with mild trauma and a fracture of the right femur as a result of a road accident (motorbike).
Diagnostic laboratory and imaging studies were requested:
- Laboratory: complete blood count, glycaemia, transaminases, ionogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis, Arc 5.
- Imaging: X-rays of the chest, complete spine, skull, hip and lower limbs; abdominal ultrasound; computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen-pelvis without and with intravenous contrast; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with slices without and with intravenous contrast, according to protocol for lower limbs.
Both conventional radiology and CT showed a non-specific osteolytic lesion with poorly defined margins involving the bone marrow, with traces of spiral fracture at the mid and diaphyseal level of the right femur that respected the respective epiphyses, without associated periosteal reaction. The adjacent soft tissues appeared to be involved.

X-ray of both hips in front. Alteration of the bone structure with cortical reduction at the level of the metaphysis with diaphyseal extension of the right femur.

Front X-ray of the right femur. Note the spiral fracture at the level of the middle and lower third.

Axial slices of computed tomography (CT) of the right thigh with soft tissue window. Densitometric changes of the bone marrow are observed, associated with atrophy of the adjacent muscles.

With a bone window, signs of fracture with cortical thinning of the bone are observed. Compared with its contralateral counterpart, atrophic changes in the muscular plane are evident.

Postoperative frontal femur X-ray. The bone graft with plate-screw fixation can be seen.

MRI showed the presence of multiloculated cystic images with heterogeneous signal hypointensity in T1 and high intensity in T2 and Stir, with tenuemedian post-contrast enhancement. It also showed the margins and extent (32 cm longitudinally) of the lesion and confirmed the involvement of adjacent soft tissue. An association with muscular hypotrophy was observed.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right thigh. Axial T1 and T2 sequences showing signal changes, heterogeneous, hypointense in T1, and iso-hyperintense in T2, intramedullary bone with extension into adjacent soft tissues.

Coronal Fat-sat and coronal T1-weighted images. Multiloculated cystic images are observed with heterogeneous signal hypointensity in T1 and high intensity in T2 and Stir. The cephalo-caudal extension of the lesion in the right femur is evident.

As ancillary data, the result of the haemogram revealed minimal decrease in red blood cells, with discrete leukocytosis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate; the Arc 5 was negative in the first analysis, changing to positive weeks later.
In the case of a patient with a pathological fracture with the presence of a solitary focal lesion, the following differential diagnoses are raised:
- Primary tumours:

  - Osteosarcoma
  - Lymphoma
  - Multiple myeloma: diffuse lesion; solitary lesion (plasmacytoma)

- Metastases
- Infectious pathology

  - Osteomyelitis
  - Cystic tuberculosis

The patient underwent a biopsy. Histopathological diagnosis determined that it was a bone hydatidosis.
Hydatidosis is a parasitic disease caused by the larvae of Echinococcus, usually of the species E. granulosus.
