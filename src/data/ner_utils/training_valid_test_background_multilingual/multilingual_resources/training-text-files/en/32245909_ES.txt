On 12 February 2020, days before this outbreak was identified, an 80-year-old woman with a three-year history of left ulcerative colitis and maintenance treatment with mesalamine came to our clinic with fever and haemorrhagic diarrhoea of 7 days' evolution. On admission, the patient reported four bloody stools per day and fever up to 38.5 °C. Laboratory tests indicated severe anaemia (haemoglobin 7 g/dL) and high C-reactive protein values (6 mg/dL). A sigmoidoscopy showed large, deep ulcers in the sigmoid colon and rectum. Stool cultures were negative, including tests for Clostridum difficile. The patient was diagnosed with recurrence of ulcerative colitis and was started on i.v. corticosteroids (methylprednisolone). (methylprednisolone 40 mg/day) was started. Over the next three days, the frequency of bowel movements decreased, fever subsided and C-reactive protein values returned to the normal range. On the fourth day he developed a fever of up to 39°C with a dry cough. Based on the evolving data on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, including information on nosocomial infections, a case of COVID-19 was suspected. A chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumonia, confirmed by chest CT. Nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was established. The patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation and a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. I.v. corticosteroids were rapidly replaced by oral prednisone and a progressive tapering of the dose was initiated. Despite an initial improvement, the patient's condition worsened and she died after 14 days of hospitalisation. At the time of death the prednisone dose was 25 mg per day.
