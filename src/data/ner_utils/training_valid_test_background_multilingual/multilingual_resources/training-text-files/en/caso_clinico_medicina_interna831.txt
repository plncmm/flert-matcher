We present the case of a 50-year-old man from Guinea Conakry, resident for nine years in Spain, HIV-positive and on antiretroviral treatment (TDF/ FTC/EFV). He had travelled to his country for four months, where he developed diarrhoea and abdominal pain that required hospital admission. He presented with CD4 77/μL, Hb 7.2 g/dL, normal abdominal ultrasound, negative stool culture and parasites. He received empirical treatment with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, fluconazole, cotrimoxazole and omeprazole with improvement. ART was changed to AZT/3TC and LPV/r.
Three months after his return to Spain, he started a new two-week course of symptoms with 4-8 liquid stools without pathological products, nausea, epi-mesogastric pain, prostration and loss of 10 kg. On admission he had hypotension, creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, eosinophils 5,260/μL, CD4 211/μL and HIV viraemia 1100/ml. Stool cultures, Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica antigens, parasites and Cryptosporidium stain in stool, thick drop, microfilariae in blood and multiple serologies were negative. Sequential empirical treatment with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, cotrimoxazole, albendazole, praziquantel and ivermectin was started, with clinical improvement. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed with biopsies without alterations. On discharge, ART was changed to DTG/ABC/3TC and prophylactic daily cotrimoxazole was maintained. As eosinophilia persisted, the dose of cotrimoxazole was reduced and two weeks later he was admitted again for the same symptoms as before. This time Cystoisospora belli oocysts were visualised in the stool, and the condition improved rapidly after a new course of cotrimoxazole and prolonged secondary prophylaxis.
