We present the case of a 36-year-old male who practices sex with men (MSM), diagnosed with HIV infection in 2014 (Nadir CD4 165). Smoker and polydrug user (Chemsex and Slamsex). He has been treated for multiple sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and maintains 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART).
In 2017, he consulted for polyadenopathy associated with B symptoms (CD4 27%, 562 cells/mL, CD4/CD8 ratio=0.37 and HIV CV 5.7 log), and a lymph node biopsy was requested. The patient was lost to follow-up and was seen 8 months later due to enlargement of the lymph nodes. Suspecting a lymphoproliferative disorder, a lymph node biopsy and a CT/PET scan (supra- and infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathies) were performed, among others. Serum qualitative herpesvirus PCR for HHV-4 was positive (HHV-8 negative). The definitive diagnosis was nodal Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the main risk factors being low CD4 count and high viral load. ART was restarted with ABC/3TC/DTG.
The patient continues drug use. Six months after diagnosis (HIV CV<1.57 log), CT scan shows a steady increase in cervical lymph nodes. The second lymph node biopsy confirms the diagnosis of an HIV-associated lymphoproliferative process such as diffuse large cell lymphoma with focal Kaposi's sarcoma (HHV 8+). Treatment was started with R-CHOP and the patient is currently in complete remission. Nodal KS is included in the differential diagnosis of polyadenopathy in a patient with HIV infection and poor virological control. HHV8, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), causes pathology in tumour forms or lymphoproliferative syndromes. The involvement of HIV and EBV infection in the pathogenesis of lymphomas has been extensively demonstrated. The diagnosis of suspected lymphoma in any HIV patient with EBV (HVV-4) viraemia is essential and may anticipate the development of a future lymphoma.
