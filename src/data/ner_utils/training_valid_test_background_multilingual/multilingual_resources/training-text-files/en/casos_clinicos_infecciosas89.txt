We present the case of a 79-year-old man with no drug allergies. He suffers from arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia as cardiovascular risk factors, with good home control. He has left hydronephrosis with reduction of the renal parenchyma leading to chronic renal failure with a creatinine clearance of approximately 40 ml/min/1.73m2. In addition, he has prostatic symptoms, with a suspected left testicular tumour under study by Urology and presented a massive pulmonary thromboembolism in 2017 with no clear precipitant with normal coagulation study. Since then, he has been anticoagulated with direct-acting anticoagulants. As usual treatment, the patient takes apixaban, amlodipine, tamsulosin and omeprazole. He has an active baseline life and is independent for basic activities of daily living. He has no cognitive impairment, sphincter incontinence or gait disturbance.

The patient was brought to the emergency department by ambulance after his family found him on the floor with sphincter incontinence, difficulty in mobilisation and behavioural alteration, with mutism and disorientation. In the days prior to the episode, the relatives report the presence of continuous nausea without vomiting, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits or fever, and gait disturbance with lateralisation the day before the fall. On examination, he was conscious but disoriented, with irregular cooperation and slowness to simple commands, with no clear neurological focality. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.

The blood tests carried out in the emergency department showed 11,700 leukocytes in the haemogram with 78% polymorphonuclear cells, normal red blood count and platelets, with normal coagulation. Biochemistry showed creatinine 1.89 mg/dl (glomerular filtration rate 37 ml/min/1.73m2), sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.8 mEq/L and C-reactive protein (CRP) 10.8 mg/dl. Thyroid hormone levels and urine system were normal. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of infiltrates in the pulmonary parenchyma or pleural effusion. The ED study was completed with a non-contrast CT scan of the skull showing marked dilatation of the ventricular system, not proportionate to the degree of cortical atrophy, which could correspond to normotensive hydrocephalus in an appropriate clinical context. In addition, there is an ectatic and tortuous basilar artery. During the afternoon after admission, the patient became more agitated and nervous, not cooperating or recognising his relatives, and his level of consciousness progressively decreased to a Glasgow score of 12/15. Vital signs at that time are as follows: BP 130/100 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, saturating at 91-92% with oxygen supply at 2 bpm via nasal goggles and fever of 38oC. The blood test was repeated and was similar to the previous one, although with an increase in CRP to 44 mg/dl, with normal ions and blood gases. A new CT scan of the skull was also repeated, showing no changes with respect to the previous one, and it was decided to perform a lumbar puncture to analyse the CSF.

Differential diagnosis
We found a patient with acute confusional symptoms with altered level of consciousness, slight leukocytosis with elevated CRP, fever, partial respiratory failure and dilatation of the ventricular system in the skull CT scan.
Given that there are many pathologies that present with decreased level of consciousness, a differential diagnosis should include those causes that are accompanied by hydrocephalus in their evolution. This includes CSF outflow obstruction caused by an anatomical abnormality (e.g. Chiari malformation), by a tumour or by an infectious or inflammatory disease (e.g. meningitis).1 Since no mass or other obstructive lesion was seen on our patient's CT scan of the brain, we could rule out both an anatomical abnormality and a tumour (as well as not being accompanied by the rest of our patient's clinical presentation, such as fever or elevated CRP).

Therefore, the entities that could be taken into account in the differential diagnosis would be the following:
- Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: this is a fulminant demyelinating disease that may be related to a history of immunisation or infection. It always presents with clinical manifestations of disseminated neurological disease (such as sensory deficit), in addition to other symptoms such as fever, headache, meningismus... Pleocytosis is common in CSF, usually 200 cells/Î¼l. MRI may reveal extensive gadolinium enhancement of the cerebral and medullary white matter.
- Sarcoidosis: Neurological involvement occurs in 5% of patients with sarcoidosis and is the first manifestation in about half of the cases. Neurological findings include cranial neuropathies and occasionally pachymeningitis. However, hydrocephalus would be more unusual. Aseptic meningitis is usually the only manifestation of neurosarcoidosis.
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis). Neurological complications of Wegener's granulomatosis occur in 20-50% of cases, although they are not usually the initial signs of the disease. Mechanisms of nervous system involvement include invasion of contiguous, independent structures, intracranial granuloma formation and vasculitis. Despite this, our patient has no other extracranial clinical manifestations that might suggest this entity, such as paranasal sinus or renal lesions.
- Bacterial meningoencephalitis: Both bacterial and fungal meningoencephalitis can cause chronic inflammation and scarring of the lining of the ventricle, leading to the formation of adhesions that can cause obstruction. The most common community-acquired bacterium causing meningitis in adult patients is Streptococcus pneumoniae, although meningococcus and Listeria are also common. In this case, we would find pleocytosis in the CSF with predominantly polymorphonuclear, elevated protein, decreased glucose and positive Gram staining. Brucella can cause chronic granulomatous meningitis, but is typically associated with fever, constitutional symptoms and a history of exposure to infected animals or tissues2. Finally, the spirochetes Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi can cause various neurological manifestations in advanced stages, such as meningitis, encephalitis, cranial nerve inflammation, ataxia or myelitis.
- Fungal meningitis. May cause meningoencephalitis associated with a mild, resolving or asymptomatic lung infection. The most common type of fungal meningitis is cryptococcal, although it is rare in immunocompetent patients, as are Aspergillus spp, Mucor spp and Pseudallescheria boydii. Coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis rarely spread to the central nervous system. In blastomycosis, the brain and meninges are usually affected late in the course of advanced disease.
- Tuberculous meningitis: occurs with a chronic, indolent course. The infection originates from a primary tuberculous lesion or reactivation in relation to ageing, immunosuppression or HIV infection. The characteristic features of active tuberculosis may not accompany meningitis; chest radiographs are normal in more than half of affected adults. The typical CSF pattern is mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein and reduced glucose levels. The average duration of symptoms is two to four weeks. Fever is typical, occurring during the course of the disease in more than 80% of patients. Hydrocephalus is the most common neuroradiological alteration. In our patient this entity should be considered, given the clinical features and the presence of hydrocephalus, although a priori we would be dealing with an immunocompetent patient, which would be less likely. It could also be an infection by M. avium, although in these cases the patient usually had a productive cough and abnormal chest X-rays.

Evolution
After performing the lumbar puncture, empirical treatment with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone was started and, given the serious clinical condition of the patient, with a marked decrease in the level of consciousness and progressive respiratory failure, he was transferred to the ICU where he finally required orotracheal intubation.
Cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry showed clear fluid with 21 leukocytes (89% mononuclear), glucose consumption (20 mg/dl) and proteinuria (169 mg/dl). Gram stain showed no micro-organisms. Since the patient did not show clear improvement with antibiotic treatment, it was decided to perform a new lumbar puncture, and a positive tuberculosis PCR was detected, confirming its growth in the subsequent culture. Treatment was started with rifampicin/pyrazinamide/isoniazid (Mycobacterium tuberculosis was sensitive to all first-line tuberculostatics). Sputum smear microscopy of respiratory samples was also positive, requiring respiratory isolation. New imaging tests, both CT and MRI, continued to detect hydrocephalus one week after starting anti-tuberculostatic treatment, and an external ventricular drain was placed, with no clear clinical improvement in the level of consciousness, so it was removed three days later. A CT scan of the chest showed multiple small nodules in the lower and upper right lobe, which did not appear to be related to tuberculosis.
HIV serology was negative. As complications in the ICU he presented tracheobronchitis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and two episodes of bacteraemia secondary to central venous catheter infection, one of them due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and the other to Klebsiella pneumoniae, treated with linezolid and ciprofloxacin respectively. He was transferred to the hospital ward with haemodynamic and respiratory stability and some improvement in the level of consciousness, albeit fluctuating over the following days.
It was decided to perform a ventriculostomy due to the persistence of hydrocephalus with significant ependymal transudate in a control CT scan of the skull performed one month later. Finally, despite the measures taken, the patient continued to deteriorate progressively from the neurological point of view and died almost two months after starting anti-tuberculosis treatment.

Final diagnosis
Acute confusional syndrome with decreased level of consciousness secondary to tuberculous meningitis in an immunocompetent patient.
