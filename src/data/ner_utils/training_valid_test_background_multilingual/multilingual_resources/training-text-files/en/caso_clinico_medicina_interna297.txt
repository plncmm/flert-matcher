Male, 21 years old with no medical, toxic, personal or family history. He travelled to Ceuta and Melilla in the last month.
He consulted for asthenia and diffuse abdominal pain. It started 15 days after the trip, with progressive abdominal pain, intensity 4/10 (VAS), without concomitants.

Physical examination: jaundice and petechiae on the trunk. Abdomen: painful on palpation, predominantly in the right hypochondrium. The rest of the examination was normal. CBC: leukocytes 5,110/mm3 (65%N; 20.9%L; 12.8%M); haemoglobin: 15.5 g/dL; haematocrit 45% and platelets 20,000/mm3. GOT 5020 U/L, GTP 5500 U/L, GGT 181 U/L, total bilirubin 10 mg/dL and CRP 8.4 mg/dL, prothrombin activity 68% and prothrombin time 13.9 sec. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The following differential diagnoses were made: acute hepatitis of possible infectious, medicinal, toxic, autoimmune, ischaemic origin; and less probably secondary to Wilson's disease, hypothyroidism and coeliac disease. Evolution: no clinical or analytical improvement. HIV, HAV, HBV, HEV, HCV, Rickettsia, Brucella, Leptospira, and Q fever; CMV, HSV, VZV, herpes virus type 8, toxins, autoimmunity and coeliac disease negative. After 15 days of admission without clinical improvement: pancytopenia (leukocytes: 550/mm3 (50% neutrophils; 41.9% lymphocytes, 5.8% monocytes); haemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL, platelets 10,000mm3). Consultation with haematology indicated transfusion of platelets and intravenous human immunoglobulin, corticosteroids and cyclosporine, with no analytical response and coagulation deterioration was observed, so a liver biopsy was ruled out. Chest and abdominal CT scan: 13 cm splenomegaly. Subsequent laboratory tests: worsening of pancytopenia (leukocytes 450/mm3 (50%N; 42%L; 6%M ); Hb 8.6 g/dL; haematocrit 25%; platelets 9000/mm3; fibrinogen 100 mg/dl; elevated ferritin and triglycerides (350 mg/dl), total bilirubin 18 mg/dl; GOT 3000 U/l; GPT 4500 U/l). Haemophagocytic syndrome was suspected and a bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed the presence of haemophagocytes in the aspirate, confirming the diagnosis. Specific treatment was started and a bone marrow transplant was proposed. The patient developed sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeuriginosa and died despite treatment. Acute markers of Epstein Barr infection were positive (anti VCA-IgG negative, anti EBNA IgG negative, anti VCA-IgM positive).

Final Diagnosis
Haemophagocytic syndrome secondary to Epstein Barr infection.
