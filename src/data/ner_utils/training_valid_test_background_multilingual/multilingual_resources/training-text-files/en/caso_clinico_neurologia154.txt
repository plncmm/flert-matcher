Anamnesis
57-year-old patient, with a history of spondyloarthrosis, smoker of 2 packs a day and drinker of 2 litres of beer a day, admitted for a progressive picture of 2-3 weeks of evolution consisting of progressive occipito-nucal headache, resistant to analgesia with NSAIDs, resistant to analgesia with NSAIDs, exacerbation at night and with Valsalva manoeuvres, accompanied by behavioural changes and cognitive failures (disorientation and bradypsychia, masked by severe alcohol habit) and instability with difficulty in walking on his own.

Physical examination
Blood pressure was 197/121 mmHg. Unkempt and cachectic appearance. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation with normoventilation. Neurological examination: Glasgow of 4-5-6. Right homonymous hemianopsia. Right central facial paresis. Normal strength. Indifferent cutaneous-plantar reflex. Discrete right dysmetria. Normal tactile sensitivity with right sensory extinction. Gait was unstable, with severe ataxia that allowed sitting.

Complementary tests
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 85 bpm.
- Blood tests: vitamin B12 178 pg/ml (low limit), total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, LDL 170 IU/l, GGT 260 IU/l, with the rest of the biochemistry normal. Normal haemogram. ESR 37 mm. Tumour markers: GI monitor 76.2, NSE 143.8.
- Chest X-ray: global cardiomegaly and aortic elongation, with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: multiple lesions of cystic morphology and variable size scattered throughout the encephalic parenchyma, which glow intensely in all enhancements due to their protein component with little enhancement after contrast injection, the largest of them at the level of the right cerebellar hemisphere. In addition, a voluminous right parieto-occipital mass is observed, with abundant vasogenic oedema, intratumoral bleeding foci and irregular enhancement after intravenous contrast administration, which does not appear to be related to those described above. Findings compatible with multiple metastases of some type of adenocarcinoma coinciding with tumour suggestive of a high-grade glial tumour.
Brain MRI scan showing multiple lesions of cystic morphology and variable size scattered throughout the encephalic parenchyma, and a voluminous right parieto-occipital mass, with vasogenic oedema and foci of intratumoral bleeding.
- Blood cultures: negative.
- Transthoracic ultrasound: normal, with no ultrasound signs of endocarditis.
- Serology: negative for HIV, lues, Brucella, Borrelia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cysticercosis, Toxoplasma and hydatidosis.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT): bronchopulmonary carcinoma with lobulated tumour mass measuring 66 x 80 x 60 mm in the lower lobe of the right lung infiltrating the bronchus intermedius and encompassing the bronchus of the middle lobe and the basal pyramid, invading the posterior mediastinum with infiltration of the left atrium with imprint on the right pulmonary artery. Subcarinal and prevascular adenopathies, upper and lower right paratracheal. Bilateral and diffuse emphysema with paraseptal bullae predominantly in the upper lobes. Liver with multiple cystic hypodense lesions in both hepatic lobes. Bilateral adrenal metastases. Bilateral L5 spondylosis with L5-S1 degenerative disc disease.
Thoracic CT scan showed a 66 x 80 x 60 mm lobulated tumour mass in the lower lobe of the right lung infiltrating the bronchus intermedius and encompassing the middle lobe bronchus and the basal pyramid, invading the posterior mediastinum with infiltration of the left atrium with imprint on the right pulmonary artery.
- Fibrobronchoscopy: macroscopic diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma with biopsy.
- Biopsy: undifferentiated small cell carcinoma. In the immunohistochemical study the tumour cells express Ck AE1/AE3, TTF1 and weakly chromogranin and synaptophysin.

Diagnosis
Initially, the multiple cystiform images scattered throughout the brain parenchyma raised doubts about a possible infectious pathology of the CNS, which was ruled out by the negative serology, negative blood culture, normal echocardiographic study and the permanent absence of fever. Once the elevation of the right diaphragm was studied with CT and the pathological anatomy was performed confirming pulmonary neoplasia, these lesions were assumed to be encephalic metastases of a grade IV pulmonary carcinoma with metastases at multiple levels. Given the advanced stage of the lung neoplasm and the palliative situation of the patient, a brain biopsy was discarded. Due to the absence of pathological anatomy of the right parieto-occipital lesion, we can only state in relation to its morphological appearance in the brain MRI that it was suggestive of a high-grade primary glial tumour. Thus, the final diagnosis was two synchronous neoplastic lesions:
- Stage IV small cell undifferentiated lung carcinoma with multiple brain metastases.
- Brain lesion suggestive of high-grade glioma with symptoms of intracranial hypertension.

Treatment
Treatment was started with dexamethasone to reduce perilesional oedema and, in accordance with the decision taken by the Tumour Committee, a confirmatory biopsy of the lung carcinoma was obtained in order to start palliative holocranial radiotherapy.

Evolution
During his stay on the ward, the patient's neurological deficits hardly improved. He repeatedly presented with insomnia and agitation. After 2 weeks, he was discharged home under observation of his relatives and support from Palliative Care.
