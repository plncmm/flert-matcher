A 32-year-old man consulted for: headache, cough with haemoptotic episodes, pleuritic pain and febrile fever of 5 days' evolution. No history of interest, he had a frontal piercing. Physical examination was unremarkable. CRP 353, leucocytes 21000, 17000 neutrophils. Chest X-ray showed cavitary condensation in LSD. Admitted for suspected TB with prophylactic treatment with Augmentine.
During admission, urgent Auramine was negative and the study continued. Motor aphasia, fever, elevated acute phase reactants and decreased level of consciousness. Thoracic CT scan: multiple nodules with areas of cavitation suggesting septic embolism. Cranial CT scan: left frontal hypodense area and in corona radiata. Augmentine was replaced by Meropenem and Linezolid. Echocardiogram, BAS, BAL normal. Brain MRI: acute subdural empyema. The collection was surgically drained and a sample was sent for study. Metronidazole was added and the patient progressed favourably.
Brain abscess culture positive for Prevotella melaninogenica and Parvimonar micra. Maxillofacial C. extracts the frontal piercing that caused the brain infection at the origin of the infection. On discharge the patient continued with Augmentine and progressed favourably.
