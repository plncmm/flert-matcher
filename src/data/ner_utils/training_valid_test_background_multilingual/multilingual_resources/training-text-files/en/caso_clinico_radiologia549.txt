An 83-year-old woman with epigastric pain radiating to the back and vomiting of several hours' duration. Important antecedents were appendectomy and herniorrhaphy. On examination, afebrile and normotensive, highlighting diffuse pain in the epigastrium without peritonism, with doubtful Murphy. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, pattern of cholestasis and cytolysis, and CRP of 0.5, rising.

An urgent abdominal ultrasound was requested to rule out cholecystitis. The findings showed a moderately distended, thin-walled gallbladder, without cholelithiasis. Ultrasound Murphy's murphy was doubtful. Minimal amount of free intraperitoneal fluid. Due to persistent suspicion, it was decided to perform an abdominopelvic CT scan with IV contrast after a few hours. The gallbladder showed poorly defined walls with irregular uptake, with marked perivesicular fat striation. Contiguous inflammatory changes in the antropylorus and hepatic angle of the colon. No signs of pancreatitis were demonstrated. Acute cholecystitis, possibly gangrenous, was suggested. Surgery was refused and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started. The evolution was favourable, with a decrease in AFR.
