Female patient, 43 years old, from the shapono of Wareta, (2o 47 ́ 34" N, 64o 13 ́ 46" W, Altitude: 897 m above sea level) belonging to the Yanomami community of Parima B (Alto Orinoco Municipality, Amazonas State), with no known pathological history, who began her illness in 2006, when she presented with abdominal pain located in the right hypochondrium, of moderate intensity, of a stabbing nature and hepatomegaly, for which reason she was evaluated by a local doctor. Serological studies showed positive IgG-Hydatidosis ELISA (D.O. 0.360) and positive WB for Echinococcus sp. 5 of 6 specific bands were detected. The patient was referred to the HUC where the following paraclinical results were obtained.

Laboratory: Hb: 11.8 g/dL, Ht: 35.0%, WBC: 6100, No: 56.9%, Lo: 29.3%, Eo: 8.3%. TGO: 27U/L, TGP: 18U/L. Abdominal ultrasonography, Liver: two heterogeneous images, with poorly defined hypoechogenic contours, with anechogenic images inside, without Doppler effect: one located in segment VII of 4.2 x 2.7 x 4.5 cm with total volume approx. 26.09 mL, and the other located in segment VIII of 5 x 4.8 x 4.9 cm, with total volume approx. 62.02mL. Abdominal CT scan: heterogeneous image located in hepatic segments VI and VII, of cystic aspect, bilobed, with calcification area, measuring 11 x 7 x 5 x 5 cm.

On 18/02/10, after 3 months of treatment with albendazole, she was taken to the operating theatre with a diagnosis of hepatic hydatidosis for PAIR, robotic partial cystectomy and omentoplasty.

The fluid extracted from the hydatid cyst of the surgical intervention had the same macroscopic characteristics as the fluid extracted in case 1. In this case, there were also numerous hydatids with no movement of the flaming cells and 200 hooks were observed. Morphobiometry was performed on these and an average total size of 38.42 μ, blade size of 24.41μ and hook shank size of 13.95 μ were obtained, which were characteristic of E. vogeli. The patient had a satisfactory postoperative course with tomographic controls before discharge. Three months of post-operative treatment with the described doses of albendazole was indicated and she now resides in her community.
