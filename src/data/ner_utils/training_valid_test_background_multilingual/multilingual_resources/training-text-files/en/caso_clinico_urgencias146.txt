Reason for consultation: 46 year old patient who consulted the emergency department for 12 hours of clinical evolution of behavioural disorder, disorientation and tendency to somnolence, 24 hours earlier, diagnosed as an outpatient with varicella (epidemiological antecedent of a daughter diagnosed 10 days earlier) and prescribed symptomatic treatment.

Pathological history: High blood pressure treated with amlodipine, cognitively preserved. Evolution: Patient admitted to the emergency department with a 12-hour clinical picture of behavioural disorder without fever. Vitals within the normal range, but GCS of 14 (at the expense of no spontaneous ocular opening). On physical examination, cardiorespiratory examination was normal; abdominal examination was unremarkable; neurological examination showed spatio-temporal disorientation, no meningismus and a tendency to somnolence, with isochoric and normoreactive pupils. The skin showed several lesions of varying degrees of evolution compatible with chickenpox; mucous membranes were preserved. An analytical control was requested which only showed PCR of 10 mg/L. A sample was collected for Tzanck staining (which was finally positive for VZV). Chest X-ray was normal. A non-contrast cranial CT scan was performed, which showed no abnormalities, and finally the lumbar puncture showed 26 leukocytes/microlitre, with proteins of 0.75 g/L and normal glucose. The HIV test was negative and finally the CSF PCR for VZV was positive. He was initially treated in the emergency department with parenteral acyclovir adjusted to weight, with a spectacular improvement in sensorium 12-14 hours after starting treatment. He was admitted to the ward to complete treatment. Diagnosis: Cutaneous varicella zoster with dissemination to the CNS causing meningoencephalitis.
