History, current disease and physical examination
Patient aged 43 years, with no past history of interest, who has been doing intense aerobic sport (athletics and paddle tennis) for about 7 hours a week since childhood, referred to the Cardiology department for the finding of isolated monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles (VE) on ECG performed during an examination at work. Physical examination was normal.

Complementary tests
Echocardiogram, chest X-ray and laboratory tests showed no abnormalities. There were no signs or symptoms of ischaemia in the exercise stress test, but the density of ventricular extrasystoles increased slightly at maximum effort.

Clinical course
Treatment was started with bisoprolol 5 mg per day and the Holter monitoring recorded disappearance of VE but nocturnal atrioventricular block (AVB) with several pauses, the longest of 12 seconds. The patient remained asymptomatic at all times and denied any family history of conduction disorder, dilated cardiomyopathy or sudden death. The Holter monitoring was interpreted as advanced AVB, bisoprolol was discontinued and the patient was admitted for study and monitoring. Nocturnal pauses were recorded in relation to AVB and/or sinus bradycardia of up to 7 seconds and very occasional VS. Baseline conduction was found to be normal by electrophysiological study and sleep apnoea was ruled out by polysomnography. In view of the poor clinical situation and the lack of curative treatment possibilities, analgesia was intensified and the patient died.

Diagnosis
In view of the absence of structural heart disease and relevant family history, he was diagnosed with VAB mediated by vagal hypertonia and was advised to reduce his sporting activity, but he refused.
The risk-benefit balance of implanting a single-chamber pacemaker was explained to him and he refused. 
During follow-up, he continues to be asymptomatic, although Holter ECG monitoring shows that nocturnal pauses of up to 9 seconds in duration persist.
