Patient from Morocco, living in Spain for three years. Independent for basic activities of daily living. No known drug allergies, toxic habits or cardiovascular risk factors.
Diagnosed in November 2017 with common B acute lymphoid leukaemia, starting treatment with PETHEMA-LAL/AR protocol, achieving complete remission and negative minimal residual disease after induction, without relevant complications. She subsequently received consolidation treatment without incident, and a bone marrow aspirate was performed in September 2018, showing 7.8% of cells similar to the blasts at diagnosis, and she was admitted to receive a new induction programme.
On admission he was haemodynamically stable, afebrile, with acceptable general condition, conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest, well hydrated and perfused. Rhythmic tones without audible murmurs and preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen soft and depressible, without organomegaly or signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs without alterations.
On day +3 of the cycle, she began with febrile symptoms without apparent focus, for which empirical antibiotic therapy was started with cefepime and vancomycin after drawing blood cultures. During this period he began to experience pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy treatment, for which he received multiple transfusions of red blood cells and platelets together with colony-stimulating factor. Given the scant improvement in fever and the increase in acute phase reactants, on day +13 treatment was changed to meropenem 1g every 8 hours, vancomycin 1g every 12 hours, together with posaconazole and acyclovir as prophylaxis. On day +6 of the induction cycle, grouped crusty vesicles began to appear on the right breast with a purplish base, together with the subsequent appearance of an erythematous nodule with a blister on the right thigh and, subsequently, the spread of similar lesions on both hands and the left shoulder, with areas of necrosis in the centre.

Differential diagnosis
We consider the differential diagnosis of febrile syndrome with skin lesions in a patient with oncohematological pathology, either due to an infectious or non-infectious process (such as the underlying pathology, graft-versus-host disease, pharmacological, or other aetiologies such as pyoderma gangrenosum, etc.). The type of skin lesions can guide us towards the aetiology of the lesions. Thus, in the case of ulcerative lesions we would think of fungi, bacteria, mycobacteria and viruses, while in the case of vesicular lesions we would think of viral aetiology. In the case of cutaneous nodules, fungi, bacteria and non-tuberculous mycobacteria should be considered as the cause. Another entity to take into account would be gangrenous ecthyma, caused fundamentally by Pseudomonas spp. It should not be forgotten that in the case of lesions with a necrotic centre in this patient profile, invasive fungal infections by microorganisms such as Aspergillus spp, Mucorales and other emerging species such as Fusarium spp. or Scedosporium spp. should be considered.
The type of immunosuppression of the patient can also guide us to the aetiology, distinguishing between cellular or humoral immunosuppression, neutropenia (immunosuppression in our patient) or the use of purine analogues or monoclonal antibodies.
Within each aetiological group, we should consider:
- Bacteria: in addition to the microorganisms that usually colonise the skin, such as staphylococci and streptococci, we should also consider the possibility of Pseudomonas spp, Stenotrophomona maltophila, Brucella spp, Actinomyces spp or Nocardia spp.
- Viruses: rule out Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, herpes varicella-zoster virus.
- Fungi: Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. represent the majority of fungi that produce this type of lesions, although there are microorganisms such as Mucorales, Fusarium spp. and Scedosporium spp. that are emerging fungal groups that should be included in our differential diagnosis.
- Mycobacteria: some of the most common species are M. avium, M. kansasii, M. xenopi and M. haemophilum.

Evolution
Despite broad-spectrum empirical treatment, the patient continued with fever and increased acute phase reactants, in a situation of severe pancytopenia with absolute neutropenia from day +6 of treatment. It was decided to perform a skin biopsy for pathology and microbiology, together with a new blood culture. On consecutive days, while awaiting microbiological results, the patient began to deteriorate clinically, and treatment was extended on day +22 of induction to meropenem 2g every 8 hours, linezolid 600mg every 12 hours, acyclovir 1000mg every 8 hours and liposomal amphotericin B at a dose of 3mg/kg. Little improvement in general condition, with the appearance of visual disturbances and subconjunctival haemorrhage.
Various complementary tests were ordered:
- Blood tests with progressive worsening: haemoglobin 7.5 g/dL, 13,000 platelets, 10 neutrophils, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, LDH 280 U/L, CRP 300 mg/dL, blood PCR 300 mg/dL.
- Blood PCR CMV, HSV1, HSV2 and EBV negative.
- Auramine stain, culture of Actinomyces spp., Brucella spp. and Nocardia spp. negative.
- Chest X-ray with no significant findings. On suspicion of cutaneous septic emboli, an echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were performed, with no significant alterations.
Finally, Fusarium solani was isolated in both blood culture and skin biopsy culture, pending fungigram, suspending antifungals and adding isavuconazole on day +26 of the cycle with a loading dose of 200mg every 8 hours for 48 hours and then 200 mg every 24 hours for maintenance, prescribed for compassionate use given the poor evolution of the patient with the antifungals prescribed up to that time. Finally, on the third day of starting isavuconazole and despite improvement of the skin lesions, he suffered septic shock with respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, causing the patient's death on day +29 of the cycle.

Final diagnosis
Disseminated fusariosis with cutaneous, pulmonary and probably ocular septic metastases. Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia B in the course of induction treatment.
