A 10-year-old girl with severe atopic dermatitis since the age of 2 months. From the age of 6 months she presented repeated mucocutaneous candidiasis, suppurating otitis media, disseminated molluscum contagiosum and multiple food allergy with anaphylaxis. At 10 years of age, genital warts (human papilloma virus 6) appeared.

Laboratory tests showed progressive elevation of IgE (maximum: 5724KUI/l) and CD4 lymphopenia.

Genetic study revealed a PGM3 defect (OMIM 172100), with a compound heterozygous mutation.

For severe atopic dermatitis with recurrent superinfections, therapeutic trials with oral Cyclosporine, Methotrexate and Mycophenolate-mofetil are performed and should be discontinued due to worsening immunodeficiency and partial response of the dermatitis. During the compassionate use of Dupulimab, and given the severity of the skin condition, Omalizumab was started. With the first dose, she developed anaphylaxis 3.5 hours after administration. Currently on treatment with Dupilumab, well tolerated.
