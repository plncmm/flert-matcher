69-year-old man. History of biological AVR 9 months earlier. Native of CABA, with no relevant epidemiological history. Evaluated for intermittent fever and chills of 2 months' evolution. Samples were taken for HC which were repeatedly negative; TEE: anechoic image compatible with drained abscess in mitroaortic fibrosa territory; PET-CT: hypercaptation at perivalvular level. He underwent empirical antibiotic treatment with Daptomycin 10 mg/kg/day + Ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 6 weeks with a diagnosis of probable early Ao IVPVD with negative HC. As the patient progressed favourably, it was decided not to perform surgery during the hospitalisation.
Two months after completion of ATB treatment, she returned with fever and chills. HC again negative and TEE with progression of the perivalvular lesion, it was decided to perform surgery. Perivalvular specimen was sent for culture, AP and PCR in which C. burnetti was detected by 16S DNA sequencing. Serology by IFA for Coxiella IgG 1/256. Treatment with Doxycycline 200 mg/day + Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day was started. During his evolution and without ever being able to go outside, he suffers multiple complications associated with health care, which lead to his death 5 months after surgery.
Coxiella burnetti is a rare cause of IE. It should be suspected especially in patients with negative HC and specific epidemiological factors such as contact with cattle, sheep and goats.
