Anamnesis
A 64-year-old male patient with the following personal history: smoker of 10 cigarette-days, IgG-lambda monoclonal gammopathy and seronegative polyarthritis for which he had been treated with methotrexate.
He was diagnosed in March 2018 during a study of anorexia and dyspepsia of years of evolution of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma MALT type stage IVB by means of a gastric endoscopic biopsy. He received treatment with six cycles of the R-CHOP scheme (including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone), entering complete response.
In November 2018, in the response re-evaluation study after the end of treatment, he was diagnosed by means of a new endoscopic gastric biopsy of transformation to LPB, with no further involvement in the extension study. Treatment was then started with etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin (ESHAP), receiving a single cycle in October followed by radiotherapy on gastric tumour volume with 30 Gy in 15 days in December 2018.
In December, she consulted with subacute symptoms of disorientation, motor aphasia and weakness in the lower limbs for two weeks, not associated with fever, headache, vomiting or any other symptoms, and it was decided at that time to admit her to the ward to study the symptoms.

Physical examination
Neurological examination revealed temporary disorientation, dysnomia and loss of strength in the lower limbs. No lymphadenopathy or palpable abdominal masses, normal cardiorespiratory auscultation and examination of the limbs.

Complementary tests
- Urgent laboratory tests: no notable alterations.
- Urgent cranial CT scan: no space-occupying lesions or acute/subacute ischaemic lesions. Left frontal frontal subcortical hypodense focus.
- PET/CT body: decreased uptake of cerebral cortex of the left hemisphere, especially in frontal, parietal and temporal areas, as well as thalamic regions and left basal ganglia and right cerebellar hemisphere. These alterations suggest a vascular origin. In addition, a new mass in contact with the right kidney, not visualised in previous follow-up PET scans.
- Biopsy of retroperitoneal mass: plasmablastic lymphoma infiltration.
- MRI of the brain: left frontal irregular lesion that does not enhance with contrast and with increased vascularisation, suggesting a neoplastic origin, possibly diffuse astrocytoma. Hyperintense punctate lesions in FLAIR and T2 in subcortical white matter compatible with small vessel arteriopathy. Right cerebellar lesion with an encephalomalacic appearance.
Cerebrospinal fluid study: normal biochemistry, Gram stain without microorganisms, negative cultures, cytometry with absence of data of infiltration by lymphoma, negative PCR herpes virus and varicella zoster.
- Electroencephalogram: activity without abnormalities.
- Brain lesion biopsy: changes compatible with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with positivity for SV-40 antibody (JC virus). Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, macrophages and oligodendroglial cells with atypical large nuclei with erased chromatin. No evidence of infiltration by primary glial neoplasia or lymphoma. Moderate nuclear positivity for HSV-I with granular pattern.
- HIV serology: negative.

Diagnosis
Given the results of the brain imaging tests with the finding of a left frontal lesion that did not enhance with contrast and increased vascularisation, the initial differential diagnosis was considered to be primary CNS neoplasia, lymphoma and lesion of inflammatory origin. He was assessed by neurosurgery, who ruled out the need for urgent surgery and added corticosteroids to the treatment in descending doses, with subsequent improvement in symptoms. After presenting the case to the Neuroncology Committee and the progressive worsening of symptoms despite medium-term corticotherapy, it was decided to biopsy the lesion. The preliminary anatomical pathology report described a primary brain tumour, which was then assessed by medical oncology, with the option of astrocytoma vs. high-grade glioma being considered.
Subsequently, after an exhaustive analysis of the sample, the lesion was confirmed to be infectious in origin, specifically PML; in addition, weak positivity for HSV-1 was detected.

Treatment
Given the limited therapeutic options for non-HIV patients, it was decided to start treatment with mirtazapine for PML and acyclovir for HSV-1 positivity, with progressive worsening of the patient's clinical and general condition, and later maraviroc was added.

Evolution
The evolution was unfavourable, with a progressive worsening of the neurological symptoms (appearance of hemiplegia, facial paralysis, mutism), onset of fever probably related to aspiration pneumonia with episodes of hypoxaemic respiratory failure and incoordinated movements of paretic limbs for which anticonvulsant treatment had to be added.
Finally, the patient was discharged in February 2019 after two months of hospitalisation.
