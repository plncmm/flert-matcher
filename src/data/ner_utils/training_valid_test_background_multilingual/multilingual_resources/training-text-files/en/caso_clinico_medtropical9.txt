We present the clinical case of a 63-year-old male patient with a history of chronic constipation, who has had several admissions for this cause and since childhood has lived in the rural area of the community of Santa Johana in the municipality of Itamarandiba, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. She reports that for approximately 3 months she has been feeling tired quite easily, feeling faint and having difficulty defecating, which she had not given any importance to until she began to experience other symptoms, such as abdominal distension, meteorism (accumulation of gas), rash, bowel sounds and continued to have difficulty defecating, which she could only do with the help of tea and laxatives; for this reason she decided to seek specialised medical help.

Positive findings on physical examination
- Mucous membranes: hypo-coloured and moist.
- Cardiovascular system: arrhythmic and audible heart sounds, blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg, heart rate (HR): 84 beats/minute.
- Abdomen: distended, hydro-aerial sounds present and normal, painful on superficial and deep palpation, presence of a mobile, elongated, spindle-shaped, somewhat firm tumour with diffuse abdominal tympanism and contrasting dullness in the area of the left lower quadrant over the mass already described.

Complementary examinations (the most important are listed)
- Complete blood count: Hb 10,5 g/L(decreased)
- Uric acid: 3.4 mg/dL
- Triglycerides: 114 mg/dL
- Blood urea: 2.7 mg/dL
- Plasma creatinine: 1.10 mg/dL
- Serology (VDRL): non-reactive
- HIV: non-reactive
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm within normal limits for her age.
- Enema colonic X-ray: dilatation with elongation extending into the sigmoid colon.
- Abdominal ultrasound: ultrasound images consistent with faecal occult.
- Chagas test: positive. It was repeated on 2 occasions and the diagnosis was corroborated.

Several immunological tests. Detection of parasite-specific antibodies in the blood.
- Complement fixation
- Indirect haemagglutination
- ELISA technique
- Direct agglutination
- Particle agglutination

Positivity was corroborated.

The patient was treated surgically, a colostomy was performed and post-surgical evolution has been favourable. He is being followed up by the health post and surgery consultation, as well as emphasising educational and control activities in the community, which are of great value in the preventive treatment of Primary Health Care.
