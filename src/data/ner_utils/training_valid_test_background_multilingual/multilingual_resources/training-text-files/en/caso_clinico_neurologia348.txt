Anamnesis
46-year-old woman, with no cardiovascular risk factors, under treatment with escitalopram for dysthymia. Eight years ago she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) due to tingling paraesthesias in both upper limbs with demyelinating lesions in the cervical spinal cord as a finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During the 5 years following the diagnosis of the disease the patient suffered several sensory flares and in the following 2 years three motor flares with a progressive worsening of disability (increase of two points on the EDSS scale in 6 months). With a diagnosis of secondarily progressive relapsing-remitting MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4, treatment with intravenous natalizumab, 300 mg monthly, was started with good clinical response. After 27 sessions of treatment with the monoclonal antibody and with a disability of 3 on the EDSS scale, the patient began with a month of progressive symptoms of impaired speech with preserved comprehension of variable course throughout the day, with sudden worsening in the 24 hours prior to attending the neurology clinic, with total inability to utter words, without a decrease in the level of consciousness.

Physical examination
Normotensive, afebrile and with normal somatic examination. Neurological examination showed a normal level of consciousness, with slight bradyphrenia and severe dysnomia. She does not understand commands. Able to utter words and short sentences of no more than three words. Parathespastic gait of right predominance with circumduction of the right lower limb. Impossible variants and tandem. Romberg unstable. Strength in the distal lower limbs 3/5 and proximal 4/5 and in the upper limbs 4/5. Spasticity grade II of Ashworth in the lower limbs. Exalted muscle stretch reflexes with increased reflexogenic area predominantly in the right limbs. Bilateral extensor cutaneous-plantar reflexes with inexhaustible Achilles clonus and bilateral Hoffmann's reflexes. Eye movements in the form of saccades. Right homonymous hemianopsia (difficult to assess due to linguistic alteration). Fundus: bilateral papillary pallor. Rest normal.

Complementary tests
- Blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, biochemistry (including calcium and phosphorus), coagulation and proteinogram: normal.
- Serum albumin 40.20 mg/dl, serum IgG 1.46 mg/dl.
- Autoimmunity: antinuclear antibodies negative.
- Serology: negative for syphilis. Hepatitis B and C viruses negative. Human immunodeficiency virus negative.
- Serology for JC virus in blood positive.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): clear. Leukocytes 0/mm3, red blood cells 0/mm3. Glucose 67 mg/dl, protein 21 mg/dl, lactic acid 1.4 mmol/l, albumin 10.2 mg/dl. IgG 1.46 mg/dl. Culture: negative.
- Link index: 0.68 (CSF IgG x serum albumin/serum IgG x CSF albumin).
- Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray: normal.
- Electroencephalogram: focus of slow activity in the left temporal region.
- Encephalic MRI: lesions in the periventricular white matter, left internal capsule and subcortical white matter suggestive of demyelinating MS type disease, already known. Extensive signal intensity alterations were seen in the left parietooccipital subcortical white matter in T2 and FLAIR sequences, without significant mass effect and without enhancement after intravenous contrast. MRI with hyperintense lesion in the left parietooccipital white matter compatible with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and digitating lesions perpendicular to the ventricular major axis compatible with multiple sclerosis.
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in CSF for JC virus positive (234 copies/ml).

Diagnosis
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC virus, in a patient treated with natalizumab, with no history of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment.
- MS R-R stage 4 on the Kurtzke EDSS scale.

Treatment and evolution
From the onset of the clinical picture of speech impairment, treatment with natalizumab was discontinued. Three plasmapheresis followed by a dose of 625 mg of oral 6-methylprednisolone for 3 days with progressive tapering (prevention of immune reconstitution syndrome) was performed. This treatment was combined with 250 mg mefloquine daily for one week, followed by mefloquine once a week. She was also treated with 45 mg/day of mirtazapine. Two weeks later, the patient suffered sudden episodes of clonic movements of the left hemiface, predominantly mandibular, with blinking, sialorrhoea and profuse sweating for 2-3 minutes, followed by a "daze" for a quarter of an hour. After the third episode, treatment with levetiracetam up to a dose of 500 mg/12 h is started. The actual neurological examination showed worsening of strength in the right hemibody with increased difficulty in walking. Strength had worsened in the right extremities with distal plegia in the right upper limb and a grade 2/5 proximal. A second encephalic MRI was performed, where a progression of the lesions was observed, covering the parietal, occipital and temporal areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Extensive hyperintense lesion of the white matter in the temporo-parieto-occipital region in the left hemisphere and occipital in the right hemisphere compatible with progression of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Treatment was started with cidofovir at a dose of 5 mg/kg with the hydration protocol and probenecid on a weekly basis for three weeks and then biweekly thereafter. At the last examination, the patient's right lower limb paresis had improved, with adequate seizure control.
