Personal history
29-year-old male patient, with no known drug allergies or medical or surgical history of interest.

Epidemiological history
Born in India, he has lived in Angola for 15 years and travels frequently to Hong Kong for work.

Present illness
He came to the emergency room of a Spanish hospital because while he was on a cruise with his wife in Greece and Turkey, on the 8th day of the trip, he began to suffer from fever, jaundice, abdominal pain and diarrhoea without pathological products. He went to a medical centre in Turkey, where he underwent a blood test showing GOT 132 U/L; GPT 244 U/L; GGT 199 U/L, negative HBV and HCV serology, negative thick drop and smear test. Three days later, on the 12th day of the cruise, once the cruise was over, he continued with the same clinical picture. He had previously been in Hong Kong for 20 days and during the 7 days prior to the trip in Angola.

Physical examination and complementary tests
At the emergency department, he presented fever (39o), BP 93/54 mmHg, HR 93lpm, and on physical examination he presented hepatomegaly of 2 crosses, with no other significant alterations. Laboratory tests showed 18000 platelets, creatinine 1.74 mg/dL, total bilirubin 12.14 mg/dL (direct bilirubin 8.63 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 3.51mg/dL), GOT 141 U/l, GPT 163 U/L. ECG and chest X-ray with no significant alterations; abdominal ultrasound showed discrete hepatomegaly. The rapid malaria diagnostic test was repeated and was positive, smear and thick blood smear with parasitaemia 17%.

Evolution during admission
A diagnosis of severe malaria was made, with hyperparasitaemia, jaundice/transaminasemia and thrombocytopenia as poor prognostic criteria. Admission to the ICU and treatment was started with artesunate i.v. for 3 days during his stay in the ICU. Subsequently, with recovery of renal function, thrombocytopenia, tolerance of the oral route and haemodynamic stability, it was decided to transfer him to the conventional hospital ward, continuing treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet), 4 tablets every 12 hours for 3 days. During the following days he presented haemodynamic stability, progressive reduction of fever and transaminases. On day +7 of admission he again had a fever peak (38.7oC), and the blood test showed haemoglobin 10.7 mg/dL (at admission 12.2mg/dL) and LDH 1157 U/L (at admission 570 U/L). During the following days he continued with fever, decreased haemoglobin and elevated LDH, reaching the nadir of haemoglobin (8.3 mg/dL) and elevated LDH 1582 U/L on day +14 of admission. Haemolytic anaemia was studied and the following complementary tests were performed:
- Study of haemolysis: elevated reticulocytes, decreased Hb, elevated LDH, normal haptoglobin and study of ferrokinetics within the limits of normality.
- Autoimmunity: ANAs and cryoglobulins within normal limits.
- Coombs negative
- No G6PD deficiency
- Immunophenotype within normal limits.
- Cholangioresonance: no significant alterations.
- With no change in clinical attitude, 13 days later he presented haemoglobin levels of 10.2 mg/dL, LDH 647 U/L, total bilirubin 2.91mg/dL with normalisation of transaminases, and it was therefore decided to discharge him home from hospital with subsequent follow-up in outpatient clinics.

Clinical judgement
Severe malaria. Haemolytic anaemia secondary to treatment with artesunate. Good clinical evolution until normalisation of the different analytical parameters.
