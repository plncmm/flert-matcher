The patient was a 36 year old male smoker who consulted for dysphonia. Physical examination revealed an extensive friable lesion of woody consistency throughout the larynx including bands, vocal cords and part of the subglottis. CT scan of the neck and chest showed pathological lymphadenopathies in the ll-lll, jugulid-gastric and bilateral submandibular spaces. Together with multiple ground glass nodules distributed throughout the lobes of both hemithoraxes suggesting metastasis. A FNA of an adenopathy was performed and revealed necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis with no evidence of neoplasia. A PPD skin test was performed and the result was negative. The patient was taken to the operating theatre for biopsies. Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed no acid-fast bacilli, no DNA of M. tuberculosis complex was detected in the samples, and laryngeal biopsies showed only mild to moderate dysplasia and the presence of microorganisms compatible with fungi. Oral itraconazole was started and showed considerable improvement and the laryngeal lesions disappeared. A control thoracic CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules with halo and inverted halo signs suggesting ABPA, bronchoscopy showed no tumour cells and cultures were negative. Immunoglobulins were measured and an exaggerated increase in IgE was observed, and aspergillus fumigatus antibodies and RAST IgE and IgG antibodies were requested, the results of which are still pending. In view of all this, it is suspected that the patient may have an underlying cystic fibrosis that has not yet been diagnosed, so a measurement of chlorine in sweat is requested, which is still pending (consequence of the covid-19 pandemic).
