A 29-year-old man, fisherman, first consulted the emergency department for vomiting, asthenia, myalgia and fever. He was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and discharged with symptomatic treatment. Five days later, he consulted again due to persistent symptoms and decay: hypotension, tachycardia, and poor general condition were observed, as well as leukocytosis, neutrophilia, thrombopenia, acute renal failure, elevated creatine kinase and hypertransaminasemia, with normal lactate dehydrogenase. Admission to Internal Medicine with fluid therapy and supportive treatment was decided. In the following 12 hours, haemodynamic and respiratory deterioration, and admission to the Intensive Care Unit. After abdominal imaging tests that ruled out complications, extraction of blood cultures and complete blood tests with viral serology, atypical microorganisms and possible zoonosis, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with Levofloxacin and Doxycycline. The patient required ventilatory support with mechanical ventilation, continuous haemodialysis, vasoactive drugs and alveolar recruitment manoeuvres due to alveolar haemorrhage. Subsequently, microbiological results were received: negative cultures, and serology for Leptospira spp. IgM positive, confirmed with PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for Leptospira spp. in urine, confirming Weil's Syndrome, and de-escalating antibiotherapy to Doxycycline. Subsequent good evolution, being discharged from hospital, and in subsequent revisions seroconversion was observed, with positive IgG and negative IgM for Leptospira spp.
