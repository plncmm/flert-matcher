Anamnesis
A 72-year-old patient with a personal history of right aorto-iliac by-pass, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, bilateral expulsive nephritic colic, acute pulmonary oedema, mild renal failure, moderate-severe BPH in treatment with combined therapy, with no known drug allergies, She came to the Emergency Department 7 days ago for dysuria, shortness of urination, stranguria, pollakiuria, urgency, nocturia 5-6 times, accompanied by fever, predominantly in the evening, and intense pain in the perineal region, which has not improved despite outpatient treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg/12h.

Physical examination
Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths, no peritonism, Blumberg, Murphy and Rovsing negative, not painful on palpation. External genitalia: testicles and epididymis of normal size, shape and consistency, mobile, not ascended, not painful; penis normal; urethral meatus not stenotic or with signs of inflammation. Rectal examination: grade II prostate, with a left lobe with well-defined borders and adenomatous consistency, non-painful. In the right lobe, a stony mass is palpated, difficult to delimit, very painful on palpation.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests:
- CBC: white blood cells 18 x 103/μl, platelets 148 x 103/μl, neutrophils 80%, CRP 20 mg/dl. All other parameters normal.
- Biochemistry: glucose 195 mg/dl, creatinine 1.9 mg/dl, urea 85 mg/dl. Rest of parameters normal.
- Coagulation: normal.
- Sediment: leucocyturia, microhaematuria and bacteriuria with negative nitrites. Imaging tests
- Transrectal ultrasound: left lobe with normal echostructure. In the middle third of the right lobe there is an anechoic area measuring 2.71 x 1.99 cm with floating echoes within it, extending into the ipsilateral ischiorectal space.
- Pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan: prostatic hypertrophy with enlargement of the middle lobe that imprints on the bladder floor. Hypodense area in the right lower region of the prostate associated with a fluid collection in the right ischiorectal fossa, approximately 4.3 cm in transverse diameter, 3.8 cm in anteroposterior diameter and 4 cm in craniocaudal diameter.

Diagnosis
Prostatic abscess extending into the ipsilateral ischiorectal fossa.

Treatment
A bladder catheter was placed and a urine culture and blood cultures were taken (both negative), starting treatment with imipenem 500 mg/6 h and gentamicin 160 mg/24 h parenterally.
Percutaneous transperineal drainage guided by transrectal ultrasound was performed, obtaining 25 ml of purulent secretion which was sent for culture (positive for Escherichia coli). A Ch 10 nephrostomy catheter was placed.

Evolution
96 hours after drainage, the patient was discharged with bladder catheter, without fever and with progressive normalisation of analytical parameters, continuing home antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mg/8h.
