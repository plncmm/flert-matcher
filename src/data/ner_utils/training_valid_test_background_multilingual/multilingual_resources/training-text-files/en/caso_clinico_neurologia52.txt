Anamnesis
A 44-year-old woman consulted for headache and fever of 2 weeks' evolution. Her only personal history of interest was 5 years ago, she had a hormone-dependent infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, stage pT2N0M0, which was treated by lumpectomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, and which has been in complete remission ever since. As a relevant family history, she lived with a sister who suffered from treated pulmonary tuberculosis 26 years ago. She maintains treatment with triptorelin (GnRH analogue) and exemestane (aromatase inhibitor). The current history began 2 weeks before the patient came to the emergency department, when she began with a low-grade fever that turned into a fever of up to 39.5oC in the last few days, associated with oppressive headache, predominantly in the occipital and cervical regions, although with holocranial extension, which has been progressing in intensity so that in the initial assessment she presented a VAS score of 7/10, and which did not improve with conventional analgesic treatment. She has also presented nausea and some vomiting of food content. She denies any symptoms suggestive of neurological focality, as well as any other systemic symptoms in the anamnesis by apparatus.

Physical examination
General physical examination: temperature 38.9 oC, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm. No other alterations of interest. Neurological examination: slight nuchal rigidity, with negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. The rest was normal.

Complementary tests
- In the ED, analytical studies were performed (basic biochemistry, haemogram, coagulation study) which showed no alterations except for LDH levels of 201 IU/l, with CRP < 0.3 mg/dl and procalcitonin 0.069 ng/ml.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT) was normal, as were chest X-ray and urine systemic examination.
- A lumbar puncture was performed with an opening pressure of 300 mm H2O, no blockages and clear cerebrospinal fluid. The result of the cytobiochemical study was 50 leukocytes/mm3 (15% polymorphonucleated, 85% mononucleated), 0 red blood cells/mm3, glucose 21 mg/dl (capillary glycaemia 133 mg/dl), protein 1.26 g/l. The remainder of the study was obtained from the blood.
- The rest of the study was obtained throughout the patient's admission, of which the most relevant was the positive CSF culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex sensitive to streptomycin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, isoniazid and rifampicin.
- CSF gamma interferon: 166 pg/ml.
- PCR for mycobacteria, HSV and enterovirus in CSF: negative.
- CSF culture for bacteria: negative.
- CSF cytology negative for malignant cells.
- CSF serology for lupus, Borrelia, Brucella and Cryptococcus neoformans: negative.
- Fluorescence stains and mycobacterial cultures in sputum and urine: negative.
- Serology in serum/plasma for HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis, Brucella, Toxoplasma: negative.
- Mantoux test: negative.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast: leptomeningeal uptake at the level of both cerebral hemispheres and posterior fossa structures. Axial slice of FLAIR sequence with intravenous contrast MRI showing leptomeningeal uptake at the brainstem level.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan: no signs of lymph node recurrence or distant dissemination of her breast neoplasm.
- Tumour markers: normal.

Diagnosis
Tuberculous meningitis.

Treatment
Initially, given the picture of meningitis with lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhoea and hyperproteinorrhoea of subacute onset, empirical antimicrobial treatment was started with ampicillin (2 g/4 h intravenous), acyclovir 10 mg/kg/8 h intravenous), ceftriaxone (2 g/12 h intravenous) and oral tuberculostatics, as well as dexamethasone (8 mg/6 h intravenous). After ruling out other infectious aetiologies (viral and bacterial), in addition to tumour (meningeal carcinomatosis) and non-infectious inflammation, he was maintained only on anti-tuberculosis treatment: isoniazid 300 mg/24 h (together with pyridoxine 300 mg/week), rifampicin 600 mg/24 h, pyrazinamide 2 g/24 h and levofloxacin 500 mg/12 h.

Evolution
The patient showed progressive improvement until she was asymptomatic and afebrile 10 days after starting treatment. As a pharmacological side effect, she presented progressive asymptomatic hepatopathy with a cytolytic profile, with GOT and GPT values of up to 141 and 208 IU/l, respectively, 15 days after starting treatment, making it necessary to replace isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide with second-line antituberculosis treatment (linezolid, ethambutol and amikacin, in addition to levofloxacin). Given the good evolution of the liver profile, the pharmacological treatment was progressively changed, so that she was discharged from hospital with isoniazid, rifampicin and levofloxacin for another 2 months and then isoniazid and rifampicin for another 9 months. On subsequent outpatient follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic and did not present any further complications.
