A 72-year-old man with no relevant past history presented with sudden left hemiparesis, altered mental status and refractory status epilepticus. In retrospect, the patient's family reported mild respiratory symptoms since a few days before.
Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and negative for influenza A and B viruses and adenovirus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an increased erythrocyte count (500/mm3) due to traumatic lumbar puncture and apleocytosis (30 leukocytes/mm3). RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus as well as bacterial cultures were negative in CSF.
A non-contrast CT scan showed intense right hemispheric hypodensity with some hyperdense areas, involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule and splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as the deep white matter. A slight hypodensity was also seen in the left thalamus. These alterations caused a moderate mass effect in the medial structures. Among the scattered areas of parenchymal haemorrhage, spontaneous hyperdensity was detected in the deep cerebral veins and in the cerebral magna vein. A CT phlebogram showed no opacification of these veins, confirming the diagnosis of acute cerebral deep vein thrombosis complicated by a haemorrhagic venous infarction.
