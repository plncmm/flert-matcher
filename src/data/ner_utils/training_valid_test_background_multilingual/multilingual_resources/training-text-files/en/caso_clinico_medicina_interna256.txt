A 65-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia. In a study for constitutional syndrome, he was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum and an abdominal CT scan showed a mass in the pancreatic uncinate process, confirming pancreatic adenocarcinoma after ERCP. He received radiotherapy and underwent colostomy and cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. Drainage and bile fluid cultures were taken and Escherichia coli BLEE, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated, and antibiotherapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was started, and she remained afebrile for eight days postoperatively. Subsequently, he developed a fever of 39Â°C, chills and vomiting. Examination with no findings except for an ejection systolic murmur; the patient was given a central venous catheter for postoperative parenteral nutrition. New blood cultures and drainage cultures were taken, VVC was removed and its tip was sent for culture. Despite changing antibiotic therapy to meropenem + vancomycin, fever persisted. Subsequently, Candida albicans was isolated in blood cultures, catheter and surgical drainage cultures, so fluconazole 400mg/day was added, and the patient continued to be febrile and acute phase reactants increased. Echocardiography, ocular fundus, echo-Doppler of supra-aortic trunks, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Given the suspicion of possible pulmonary septic emboli, a thoracic tomography was requested, showing evidence of septic thrombophlebitis due to Candida Albicans in the subclavian artery. He died within hours due to multi-organ failure.
