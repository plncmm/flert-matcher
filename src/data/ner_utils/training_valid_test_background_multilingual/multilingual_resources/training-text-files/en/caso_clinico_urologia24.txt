Anamnesis
A 48-year-old male patient with a history of repeated renal colic (with expulsion of calcium oxalate lithiasis) treated on an outpatient basis, who came to the emergency department with colicky pain in the right renal fossa of 24 hours evolution, radiating to the genitals, nausea and vomiting, being treated with ibuprofen, although without clear improvement. He did not report thermometric fever, micturition syndrome or haematuria. Of note was a significant asthenic habitus, generalised weakness, difficulty in moving from sitting to standing, myalgia and generalised arthralgia.
In February 2013, she visited her primary care doctor for clinical symptoms of low back pain, and was referred to the traumatology department, with no findings; on examination she had a nodule measuring approximately 2 cm on the right lateral aspect of the neck, for which a cervical and thyroid ultrasound scan was requested, which was not performed due to the current intercurrent episode.

Physical examination
Patient in good general condition, visibly weak, with correct hydration of skin and mucous membranes, large abdomen with significant adipose tissue, no palpable masses or organomegaly, depressible and soft, with pain in the right flank, with no signs of irritative peritoneal reaction. The right renal fist percussion and the right Guyon's sign were positive. Lower extremities without oedema. The rest of the examination showed no findings of interest.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: calcaemia 16.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 3.8 mg/dl, intact PTH 2,574 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase 222 IU/l, creatinine 3.31 mg/dl with an estimated filtration rate of 20 ml/min. Rest without findings.
- Blood count: haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl. Haematocrit 28%.
- Coagulation without alterations.
- Urine sediment 1-5 leukocytes per field.
- Abdominal X-ray: nephrocalcinosis, at the level of the pelvic skeleton, irregularity of the iliac surface of the sacroiliac joints due to resorption and subchondral sclerosis and enlargement of the joint space. Subchondral resorption on the right margin of the symphysis pubis.
- Bone series: given the above findings, the Radiodiagnosis service considered the possibility of completing the study with cranial and phalangeal X-rays, the former showing a "salt and pepper" skull (diffuse granular pattern of cranial demineralisation), while the latter showed subperiosteal resorption of the radial edge of the middle phalanges of the fingers and incipient resorption of the distal tufts of the first, second and third fingers of the hands.
- Urological ultrasound: bilateral renal nephrocalcinosis without ectasia of the excretory tract; there is a small cyst of 12 mm upper left renal polar. No other findings of interest.
- Ultrasound of the neck: adjacent to the right thyroid lobe a hypoechoic nodular lesion with cystic/degenerated areas is identified, compatible with parathyroid adenoma. It measures approximately 39 x 25.2 x 47 mm (T x AP x L). On the left side there is another nodule inferomedial to the left thyroid lobe, hypoechoic, suggestive of left parathyroid adenoma, measuring approximately 37 x 12.6 x 16.2 mm (L x AP x T). Thyroid gland of normal size and morphology, with preserved echogenicity. At least two nodules were identified in the LTD measuring 7.8 and 12 x 7.4 mm, respectively. All this is compatible, given the location and context, with right and left parathyroid adenomas.
- Cervicomediastinal SPECT/CT: the early planar image shows two foci of increased uptake of 99mTc-MIBI: one focus at the level of the upper pole of the right thyroid lobe and another focus in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe, which persist in the late image once the thyroid tissue has been washed out. In the low-dose SPECT-CT fusion image, the larger focus is located outside the hyoid bone (right side) and the smaller focus is located left paratracheal below and posterior to the left thyroid lobe; these images are compatible with double parathyroid adenoma.
- Bone mineral densitometry: femoral neck Z-score -2.1 SD. Lumbar Z-score -2.9 SD.

Diagnosis
Primary hyperparathyroidism due to double parathyroid adenoma. Chronic renal failure secondary to nephrocalcinosis.

Treatment
The patient evolved favourably from renal colic with intravenous analgesia, not requiring urinary diversion.
Abundant hydration by means of intravenous serum therapy was started, as well as administration of zolendronic acid, cinacalcet, oral calcium and darbepoetin alfa. After the patient's clinical stabilisation, reaching a calcaemia of 8.3 mg/dl and intact PTH of 53.3 pg/ml, he was scheduled for parathyroidectomy, which was carried out without incident, with a rapid decrease in intraoperative PTH concentrations in the blood.
He is currently awaiting discharge from the General Surgery Department, as well as follow-up in Endocrinology consultations, after normalisation of PTH and serum calcium.
