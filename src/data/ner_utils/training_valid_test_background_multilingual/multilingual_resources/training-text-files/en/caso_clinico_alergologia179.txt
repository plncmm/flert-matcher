4-year-old girl diagnosed with cow's milk protein allergy, egg allergy, frequent episodic asthma due to sensitisation to dust mites and mild atopic dermatitis. In the neonatal period she took a bottle of adapted formula with good tolerance, after which she continued breast-feeding. At 5 months, after reintroducing adaptive formula, she developed urticaria and laryngeal stridor, so she was withdrawn and continued with soy formula. In 2011 she came to our clinic, and a prick test was performed with a battery of cow's milk proteins and fractions and specific CAP, with positive results in all cases (total IgE: 129.80, LV 25.40, ALA < 0.10, BLG 23.50, casein 14.80, milk serum 22.60). In 2013 he presented with anaphylactic shock after accidental ingestion of a dessert with traces of milk, and in 2014, it was decided to include him in a PLV desensitisation procedure (after a study with positive Prick skin tests and CAP, with higher values than before). Despite premedication, he presented frequent adverse reactions, on several occasions severe, and it was decided to discontinue treatment. Compassionate use of Omalizumab was requested, and after its initiation, the procedure was restarted, with good tolerance, and was completed without incident. She currently continues with omalizumab and is on a PLV-free diet.

Omalizumab has been useful in food allergy as an adjuvant in tolerance induction procedures. In our case, tolerance has been achieved after failure of a previous procedure.
