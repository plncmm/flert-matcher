A 50-year-old man arrived at the emergency department in shock and with a 4-day history of febrile illness.
He required intubation and use of inotropes.
It is important to see the "blind areas" of the chest X-ray in order not to miss important clues. These areas are under the diaphragm, behind the heart, hilum, and soft tissues. This CXR shows a lucidity over the hepatic density. The lucidity does not conform to the usual bowel configuration. In this clinical context, an important differential diagnosis to be considered is a ruptured liver abscess. This can be confirmed at the bedside with ultrasound or CT.
Liver abscesses are usually due to organisms such as Klebsiella or Amoebae. All patients with Klebsiella bacteraemia of unknown origin should have imaging studies of the abdomen to rule out liver abscess.
