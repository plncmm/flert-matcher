Anamnesis
80-year-old male, ex-smoker, dyslipidaemic, operated on for transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate in 2008 and two bladder TURs for carcinoma in situ with intravesical BCG instillations, the last one in October 2012.

Physical examination
On physical examination he was afebrile, haemodynamically stable, with normal cardiorespiratory auscultation. Abdominal examination was painful on deep palpation in the mesogastrium.

Complementary tests
- The blood test showed a haemoglobin of 13.9 g/dl, without leukocytosis (leukocytes 4,500/mm3, 59% neutrophils). Normal renal function with creatinine 0.9 mg/dl and urea 40 mg/dl. Urine sediment normal. Negative urine culture.
- With the diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin, an outpatient ultrasound was requested, which showed aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta measuring 3.2 x 3.5 cm with mural thrombus and diffuse calcified atheromatosis.
- The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of aortic aneurysm for study, performing an abdominal CT angiography, which described the presence of increased infrarenal periaortic density with trabeculation of adjacent fat and normal aortic calibre compatible with inflammatory aortitis.
- Based on these findings, it was decided to perform a FNA of the periaortic region with a positive smear test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin.

Diagnosis
Tuberculous aortitis secondary to intravesical instillations of BCG.

Treatment
Anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin 600 mg, ethambutol 1,200 mg and isoniacin 300 mg daily.

Evolution
Ultrasound checks were carried out, observing good evolution and symptomatic response, for which he was discharged after 15 days. Thirty days after starting treatment, a new CT scan was performed, confirming the improvement described in the previous ultrasound scans.
