We present the case of a 51-year-old male with no medical history of interest who came to the emergency department with a dry cough and dyspnoea on moderate exertion of 7 days' duration. On physical examination the patient was eupneic, afebrile and pulmonary auscultation was normal. Chest X-ray showed peripheral and bilateral pulmonary opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, which, in the epidemiological context in Spain in March 2020, was compatible with COVID-19. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was positive. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine for 5 days and lopinavir/ritonavir for 10 days. He remained in hospital for 15 days until clinical improvement, with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Two days after discharge, he presented with an abrupt onset of an erythematous maculopapular rash on the trunk with islets of healthy, slightly pruritic skin. Topical betamethasone dipropionate and 20mg of oral bilastin were prescribed, but after 24h the lesions spread to the cervical region, face and proximal region of the upper limbs, so 30 mg of oral prednisone was added. The clinical response was favourable, with disappearance of the lesions in a few days.
