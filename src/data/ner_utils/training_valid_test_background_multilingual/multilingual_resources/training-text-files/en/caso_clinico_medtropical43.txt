White male, peasant farmer, 57 years old, from Vertientes, Camagüey. He was admitted on 17 December 2009 to the "Manuel Ascunce Domenech" Provincial Hospital in Camagüey, with a presumptive diagnosis of infectious endocarditis due to Brucella and moderate aortic insufficiency. He presented with fever of 38.0-38.5oC for 4 months, generally at night, accompanied by sweating; chills; joint pain, especially in the back and both knees; impotence; nervousness; myalgia; marked asthenia, which prevented him from carrying out his usual activities; dyspnoea and precordial pain. Three previous admissions for a chronic febrile syndrome of more than 9 months of evolution were noted, with an initial diagnosis of endocarditis due to rheumatic fever, for which he underwent complementary examinations and medical treatment with various antimicrobials, without improvement of the patient. The possibility of other causes of endocarditis was ruled out.

A slow serology for brucellosis was indicated among the complementary tests, but due to the unavailability of reagents these tests were not performed until January 2010, when the disease was diagnosed with high serological titres and infective endocarditis as a superadded complication.

Epidemiological background: the patient has lived in a rural area for years in direct contact with cattle and pigs, handles animal births, frequently ingests milk and dairy products; he has a history of wounds and microtrauma to his hands and feet, typical of his work. His farm adjoins another farm with cattle affected by brucellosis (statistical reports obtained from the Institute of Veterinary Medicine of Camagüey, 2010).

Positive findings on physical examination:

- Cardiovascular system: heart sounds of good tone, no third or fourth sounds, systolic murmur II/IV in second right intercostal space, with irradiation to the vessels of the neck.
-Blood pressure: 120/80.
- Heart rate: 68 per minute.
- Echocardiogram: vegetations in aortic valve.
- Anteroposterior and lateral chest X-rays: no lesions were observed.

Complementary examinations performed:

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 6 mm/h; reference values (RV) 3-10 mm/h.
- Lipidogram:

  - Cholesterol 4.19 mmol/L; RV. 3.9-6.5 mmol/L
  - Triacylglycerides (triglycerides): 1.32 mmol/L; RV. 0.35-1.70 mmol/L.
  - Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL): 1.53 mmol/L; VR. < 0.8 mmol/L.

- Creatinine: 59 μmol/L; RV. 44.2-132.6 mmol/L.
- Uric acid: 235 μmol/L; RV. 237-392 mmol/L.
- Glycaemia 4.7 mmol/L; RV. 4,2-6,11 mmol/L.
- Leukogram: 8.6 x 10 9/L; RV. 5-10 x 109/L.

  - Neutrophils: 0,45; RV. 0,55-0,65.
  - Lymphocytes: 0,53; RV. 0,25-0,40.
  - Eosinophils: 0,02; RV. 0,01-0,03.

- Haematocrit: 0,35; RV. 0,41-0,54.
- Blood culture for brucellae: no bacterial isolation.
- Serology: Rose Bengal test: ++++; 2 mercaptoethanol: positive.

  - Slow serology for Brucella (seroagglutination in tubes): 1:320 dilution.

The patient received treatment based on: aminoglycosides: gentamicin (ampoules 80 mg/2 mL) 2 ampoules every 12 h + amikacin (bulbs 500 mg/2 mL) 1 bulb every 12 h for 7 d, doxycycline (tablets 100 mg) 100 mg every 12 h + rifampicin (capsules 300 mg) 300 mg every 12 h for 6 weeks, and improved markedly.

He was discharged with a diagnosis of Brucella infective endocarditis and moderate aortic insufficiency, with improved evolution, after 30 days of hospital stay and follow-up of the valvulopathy by consultation with internal medicine, cardiology and epidemiology.
