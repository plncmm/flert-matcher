A man from Wuhan reported fever, dyspnoea and myalgia since 28 January. On 10 February his condition worsened and he experienced confusion and disorientation. Laboratory tests showed a low white blood cell count (3.3×109/L) and lymphocytopenia (0.8×109/L). Cranial CT was normal, while thoracic CT showed several subpleural ground-glass opacities. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was transferred to our institution. On physical examination, vital signs were stable with no alteration of consciousness. Signs of meningeal syndrome (nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign) and Babinski's sign were observed. Arterial blood gases showed a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 240 mmHg. This COVID-19 patient was treated with arbidol and oxygen therapy, but his disorientation did not improve. On 16 February, a lumbar puncture was performed; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 220 mmHg. CSF tests showed leukocytes (0.001 ×109/L), protein (0.27 g/L), ADA (0.17 U/L) and glucose (3.14 mmol/L) within normal limits. The CSF sample was also tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was negative. The patient showed no signs of bacterial or tuberculous CNS infection. After careful neurological evaluation, encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined. Treatment at that time was mainly symptomatic, including administration of mannitol. Interestingly, the patient's consciousness improved from 20 February onwards and the chest CT scan indicated an improvement of ground-glass opacities. His consciousness was fully clear by 24 February. Two consecutive pharyngeal swab tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was discharged on 27 February.
