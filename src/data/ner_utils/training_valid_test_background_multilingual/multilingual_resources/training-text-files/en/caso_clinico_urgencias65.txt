A 64-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 8 hours of polyarthritis of the hands and feet. His personal history included a fracture of the right ankle years ago which required surgery. He had no family history of interest. He reported having presented catarrhal symptoms, with throat discomfort and cough without expectoration the previous week. She reported no previous trauma or dysthermic sensation. Examination revealed the presence of fever, arthritis in the right carpus, first metacarpophalangeal joint of the right hand and both ankles and tarsals. There was also an erythematous area on the dorsum of the 2nd metacarpophalangeal joint of the right hand. Given the history of catarrhal symptoms in the previous week, it was interpreted as reactive arthritis and treatment with corticosteroids was administered. Forty-eight hours later, the patient presented again with worsening general condition, fever (38.7oC) and increased erythema, oedema and pain in both hands and feet. Additional tests showed 16,900 leukocytes, 90% polymorphonuclear, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 118 mm/1o h and a C-reactive protein of 303.2 mg/dl. Plain radiographs of the chest, hands and feet showed no abnormalities. Three blood cultures were drawn and all were negative. Arthrocentesis of the right ankle was performed and an inflammatory fluid was obtained, the culture of which showed growth of NM.
