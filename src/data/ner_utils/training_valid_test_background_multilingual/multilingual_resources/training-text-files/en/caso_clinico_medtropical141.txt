25-year-old woman from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, where she lived until the age of 15, when she moved to Andrés Ibáñez, rural area of Santa Cruz. Resident in Barcelona since December 2003. In January 2004, she came to our unit for a check-up and to rule out possible Chagas disease (she reported having a son with this pathology).

Physical examination was normal, with no history of personal pathology or surgery. 

The results of the complementary tests performed were as follows:
Blood count: eosinophilia of 12.3% (7,450 leukocytes).
Coproparasitology: Ascaris, Trichiuris trichura, Giardia cysts.
Serology by indirect immunofluorescence for Trypanosoma cruzi: 1/320.

In this case we are dealing with a young woman from an endemic area with a child with Chagas disease, which is why it is important to carry out an exhaustive medical history.
