We present the case of a patient with female sex assignment at birth who initially consulted the Paediatric Endocrinology Department of another centre at the age of 12 years, expressing a male gender identity. A study was started and in the following years, primary amenorrhoea (with no response to oestrogens + progestogens), karyotype 46XY and normal response to the stimulation test with 2500 IU of HCG with elevated testosterone, and he was classified as male pseudohermaphroditism (or Morris Syndrome). Subsequently, 1 sister and 2 cousins also diagnosed with male pseudohermaphroditism were identified among the family members.
The patient abandoned the follow-up and at the age of 24 returned to gynaecology with the aim of completing the study and reaffirming his male identity by means of sex reassignment surgery. The physical examination at that time corresponded to a female phenotype with Tanner Stage III-IV breasts, vulva and clitoris of normal size, without palpable masses in the groin and vagina of normal length, with absence of uterus and ovaries in transrectal ultrasound. Laboratory tests showed LH 24.5 mIU/ml (slightly elevated), FSH 2.3 mIU/ml, Testosterone 8.8 nmol/L (slightly decreased), Estradiol 12 pg/ml, Progesterone 0.80 ng/ml and Prolactin 149 Î¼UI/ml. A genetic study was performed, detecting a specific mutation of the androgen receptor gene (change of Cytosine for Guanine in exon 2), confirming the diagnosis of Morris Syndrome, and he was subsequently referred to the Transsexual Care Unit due to his desire for sex reassignment surgery, where the study was completed with abdomino-pelvic MRI, visualising bilateral cryptorchidism.
The patient is currently awaiting bilateral gonadectomy and is awaiting a decision on the best post-gonadectomy substitution treatment option, given the difficulty involved in having a gender identity that is clearly felt and expressed as male and the intrinsic resistance to androgens that he presents.
