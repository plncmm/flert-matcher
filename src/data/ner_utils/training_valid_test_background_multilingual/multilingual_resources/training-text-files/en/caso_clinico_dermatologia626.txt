A 16-year-old girl with a personal history of asthma presented to the dermatology department with asymptomatic skin lesions that had been present for 2 months. The patient had been treated with corticosteroid cream due to an initial suspicion of atopic eczema, despite which she presented marked progressive growth of the lesions. The patient had a domestic cat that she had never taken to the vet.

Physical examination revealed ring-shaped plaques with an active peripheral border on the upper back and on the lateral aspects of the neck and face.

Local culture obtained by carpet scraping isolated Trichophyton rubrum. Based on clinical data and culture, the diagnosis of tinea incognito was established. Treatment with Terbinafine 250mg daily for 4 weeks resolved the condition.
