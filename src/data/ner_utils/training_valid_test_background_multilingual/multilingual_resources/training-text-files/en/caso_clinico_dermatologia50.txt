Loxoscelism is the clinical picture secondary to the bite of a spider of the genus Loxosceles laeta, which has a form limited to the skin and another systemic form (visceral cutaneous loxoscelism), characterised by haemolytic anaemia, haematuria, jaundice, fever, compromised consciousness and acute renal failure, with a mortality rate of around 20%. Necrotic cutaneous loxoscelism presents with a livedoid plaque within the first 24 h, resulting from vasculitis secondary to the bite and venom inoculation. It is a painful violaceous plaque, surrounded by an erythematous halo. It progresses to the formation of a necrotic eschar, which peels off and leaves a slowly healing ulcer. Treatment consists of local icing, elevation of the limb, systemic corticosteroids, analgesia and antihistamines. Anti-loxosceles serum may be used and should be administered within 4 hours of the bite.
