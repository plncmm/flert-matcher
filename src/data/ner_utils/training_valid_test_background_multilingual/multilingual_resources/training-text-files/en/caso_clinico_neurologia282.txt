Anamnesis
A 56-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation in September 2009 for Overlap syndrome and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (genotype III), who post-transplantation presented with graft dysfunction due to low tacrolimus levels. In addition, he had diabetes mellitus secondary to corticosteroid treatment and multifactorial renal failure. She was chronically treated with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, ursodeoxycholic acid, calcifediol, omeprazole, loracepam and insulin.

She had been diagnosed with probable ophthalmoplegic migraine three months earlier, following an admission for right hemicranial headache with associated vomiting and difficulty in abducting the right eye. He subsequently underwent a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which revealed thickening of the internal rectus muscle of the right eye. Years earlier, he had presented with several episodes of right periocular headache and binocular diplopia, which were not related.

She presented with right hemicranial headache and vomiting, of subacute onset a few hours earlier, which did not respond to treatment with analgesics and intravenous anti-inflammatory drugs in the emergency department, and it was therefore decided to admit her for study and treatment.

Physical examination
In the ED, the neurological examination was rigorously normal, including neuro-ophthalmological examination. There was no fever or other data of interest in the systemic examination.

Complementary tests
- Biochemistry: glucose 124mg/dl, urea 57 mg/dl, creatinine 1.11 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/l, gamma-glutamyltransferase 308 IU/l. Tacrolimus levels 3.3 ng/ml. erythrocyte sedimentation rate 46 mm/h. All others, including TSH, vitamin B12, folic acid, C-reactive protein and angiotensin converting enzyme, normal.
- Blood count and coagulation normal.
- Immunological profile: positive antinuclear antibodies at 1/320 titre.
- Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray: no significant findings.
- Serologies lupus, Lyme, Borrelia, human immunodeficiency virus, Ebstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus: negative.
- Computed tomography (CT) of the orbits and paranasal sinuses: thickening of the right internal rectus, without involvement of the retroocular fat or the rest of the oculomotor muscles.
- Cranioorbital MRI: increased thickness and T2 signal in the internal rectus muscle of the right orbit, compatible with orbital myositis. Cranial CT scan: shows thickening of the right internal rectus, as does the MRI, which also shows an increase in T2 signal at the same level.

Evolution
A few hours after admission, he developed a limitation of right eye adduction, with persistent right hemicranial pain that was controlled after treatment with analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs and high-dose corticosteroids. There was partial recovery of ocular motor function prior to discharge, after six days of admission.

Diagnosis
Recurrent idiopathic orbital myositis of the internal rectus of the right eye.
