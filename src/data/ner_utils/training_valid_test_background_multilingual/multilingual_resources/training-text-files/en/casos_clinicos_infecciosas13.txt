We present the case of a 21-year-old male, with no known drug allergies, anabolic steroid user for sporting purposes, and with a personal history of childhood hyperactivity disorder, depressive episodes currently untreated, with no other diseases or cardiovascular risk factors. After surgery for fracture of the talus a year and a half ago, he underwent a new operation in a private centre to remove the pins under spinal anaesthesia without immediate complications. The following day, after breakfast, he had a severe holocranial headache and nausea, for which he was given painkillers. Progressively, in the following hours, he began to sleep, with incomprehensible language and bruxism, and was unable to wake up, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 10/15 points (eye opening 3, verbal response 2, motor response 5) with isochoric pupils. A cranial tomography (CT) scan was performed, in which a subarachnoid haemorrhage was suspected and it was decided to transfer him to the reference hospital. While waiting for the ambulance, he had a coma crisis for 35-40 minutes, with fine tremor and great rigidity and impossibility to place an oropharyngeal cannula, requiring diazepam and, given the poor response, a perfusion of midazolam was started. On arrival of the critical care unit (CCU) for transfer, fever of 39oC was measured and he again presented a crisis described as generalised tonic-clonic movements with sialorrhoea, tongue biting and trismus, and orotracheal intubation (OTI) was performed. When he was admitted to our hospital, he presented oxygen saturation 99% with FiO2 100%, blood pressure 125/74mmHg, heart rate 96 bpm.
On examination, there were no findings of interest with a neurological examination, under sedoanalgesia with propofol and midazolam, with isochoric pupils reactive to light. An angioCT scan was requested showing: enhancement of the vessels of the Willis polygon, with partial collapse of the mesencephalic and quadrigeminal cistern; diffuse high-density images of both hemispheric sulci; absence of hydrocephalus; no aneurysm was seen and with asymmetry of the vascularisation of the left posterior cerebral region. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis 20,280 cells/ml with neutrophilia (92.1%), C-reactive protein 104.7mg/l and procalcitonin 17.73 ng/ml. Blood gases showed pH 7.32; pCO2 53mmHg; and bicarbonate 26.7mEq/l. In coagulation, prothrombin activity is 62%, activated partial thromboplastin time is 25.5 seconds and fibrinogen 442 mg/dl. In addition, a urine tox screen was requested, with positive results for benzodiazepines and cannabis. The chest X-ray showed a small right basal infiltrate probably related to bronchial aspiration.

Differential diagnosis
In the present case we must take into account the sudden onset of headache with subsequent neurological deterioration, the presence of fever and the fact that the patient had undergone spinal anaesthesia. Given this, the differential diagnosis should include:
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). This is caused by the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, and presents with severe and sudden onset of headache, usually accompanied by photophobia, sonophobia, nausea and vomiting. It may also be associated with a transient loss of consciousness, disorientation, drowsiness and coma. Cranial tomography and lumbar puncture are mandatory for diagnosis. In the case of the puncture, there is usually elevated opening pressure, haematic fluid that does not coagulate and positive xanthochromia, which is diagnostic of SAH. In addition, an angioCT should be performed to locate the source of bleeding (aneurysm, AVM) or cerebral arteriography.
- Cerebral venous thrombosis. Subacute in onset, although it can appear suddenly or chronically. The most frequent and early symptom is headache, of unspecific characteristics, progressive, intense and accompanied by symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension. There may be transient loss of vision, focal neurological symptoms and a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and a seizure. The aetiology of venous thrombosis is diverse, including coagulation disorders and infectious processes. (MRI) and/or angioMRI. However, cranial tomography may show indirect signs that can guide us to this diagnosis.
- Meningitis. It is usually caused by contiguity from a parameningeal infection, haematogenous dissemination or iatrogenic focus. Its clinical manifestations are explosive in onset and of short duration (within hours) with fever, stiff neck, altered level of consciousness and headache. For diagnosis, at least one of the symptoms of the classic triad must be present, and the diagnosis is based on the cytobiochemical characteristics of the CSF as well as the identification of a germ by culture and/or polymerase chain reaction. This should be considered as the primary clinical suspicion.
- Encephalitis. It usually begins as a pseudo-flu-like illness with mild behavioural disturbances, followed by fever, headache, meningeal signs, decreased level of consciousness, confusion, hallucinations and seizures. Diagnosis requires lumbar puncture showing cerebrospinal fluid with features of viral meningitis.
- Post-puncture headache. Occurs in the first few days after lumbar puncture, appears in the sitting position and improves with decubitus. It is often accompanied by stiffness of the neck, it is not pulsatile and its intensity is variable. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, photophobia, somnolence, diplopia, tinnitus, etc.

Evolution
A lumbar puncture was carried out and a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid was obtained. The biochemical study showed 30,443 leukocytes/l, 95% polymorphonuclear, 3,600 red blood cells, glucose 80mg/l, lactate 90.5 mg/dl, protein 302.2 mg/dl and negative xanthochromia. After obtaining the results of the samples taken in the lumbar puncture with cytobiochemistry compatible with bacterial infection, empirical antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone and vancomycin together with corticotherapy. It was decided to perform an electroencephalogram (EEG) which showed no epileptiform activity, as well as a new brain scan which showed a doubtful thrombosis of the sinuses due to asymmetry of the same to be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. After withdrawal of sedoanalgesia and mechanical ventilation, the patient remained awake without neurological focality. On arrival, a chest X-ray showed a small infiltrate related to bronchoaspiration secondary to the low level of consciousness, which disappeared in the radiological control, without incident and he was asymptomatic from the respiratory point of view.
At the analytical level, the acute phase reactants progressively decreased until normalisation. Cultures of CSF, blood and urine samples did not isolate any germ, although the 16s rRNA gene for S. salivarius was positive in CSF samples. During his admission, the haematology department was consulted due to prothrombin activity <60% in successive analytical controls, so a coagulation study was performed, which showed mild factor VII deficiency and mild hypofibrinogenemia. Once stabilised, he was transferred to the hospital ward and antibiotherapy was maintained until 14 days of treatment. In our unit, despite feeling well, he reported visual hallucinations on the first three nights of admission to the ward, with a normal neurological examination, without nuchal rigidity or other meningeal signs, for which new EEG and urgent cranial CT scan were requested, with no findings to justify the clinical condition, and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed findings compatible with cortical vein thrombosis in the right parietal region, swelling and oedema of the right superior parietal gyrus, sinus thrombosis and complete thrombosis of the transverse, right sigmoid and superior longitudinal sinuses. 
In view of the MRI findings, anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was started for 3-6 months. The clinical evolution was favourable and the visual hallucinations also disappeared. The surgical wound was re-evaluated by Traumatology with good evolution and no signs of superinfection. However, the patient again presented with fever without clear infectious focality, except for coincidence with rhinorrhoea and pharyngeal discomfort with no other symptoms. A chest X-ray was performed, which showed no findings, a normal urine systemic test and samples were taken for blood and urine culture; however, a new lumbar puncture was performed with clear and transparent CSF, a normal cytobiochemical study and a negative CSF culture. The results of the blood and urine cultures were negative, and the pharyngeal symptoms and febrile fever disappeared.

Final diagnosis
- Bacterial meningitis due to S. salivarius as probable etiology.
- Thrombosis of the cortical vein and dural, transverse, right sigmoid and superior longitudinal sinuses.
