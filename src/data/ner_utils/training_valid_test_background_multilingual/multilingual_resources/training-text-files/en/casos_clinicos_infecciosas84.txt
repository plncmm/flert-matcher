44-year-old male with no known drug allergies. Ex-smoker for 8 years. His personal history included HIV infection stage C2 with undetectable viral load since August 2017, last CD4 count in May 2018 of 536 cells/mm3 (16%), under follow-up by the Infectious Diseases Service of our hospital. His past history also included a cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma in remission, under follow-up by oncology, a normal functioning goitre and chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori infection that was treated and cured.

The only epidemiological history was that the patient lived with a cat at home. He was being treated with FTC/TAF/EVG/COBI 1 tablet per day and omeprazole 20mg/day. The patient came to the emergency department with fever of 39oC, with cough and rusty expectoration, putrid in appearance, of two weeks' evolution, without improvement after antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 500/125 mg/8h for three days. On arrival at the ED, the patient was febrile (38.5oC), hypotensive (93/58 mmHg), tachycardic (111 spm), with O2 saturation of 98% without oxygen intake and eupneic at rest. On inspection, he was in fair general condition and was not sweating profusely. Cardiorespiratory examination revealed sinus tachycardia, no audible murmurs, preserved vesicular murmur and no extra sounds. The abdomen was soft, depressible, not painful on deep palpation, without masses or megaliths, no signs of peritonism or peritoneal irritation. The lower limbs were not oedematous and there were no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Oropharyngeal examination was unremarkable. No skin lesions.

Complementary tests performed in the ED showed a leukocytosis of 20,840 cells/μl at the expense of neutrophils (17,650 cells/μl), haemoglobin of 11.6 g/ dl, with normal platelet count and coagulation. Biochemically, he had preserved renal function and a normal ionogram, with a C-reactive protein of 294 mg/L. Chest X-ray showed a large cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe, with thickened walls and spiculated borders, without costophrenic sinus impingement or other condensed images. Chest X-ray on admission: cavitated lesion in the left lower lobe. Blood cultures, sputum culture, Legionella spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigenuria in urine and urgent smear microscopy with Ziehl-Neelsen staining were negative. In view of the patient's clinical condition, it was decided to admit him to the infectious diseases department with a diagnosis of lung abscess of possible bacterial aetiology, and treatment was started with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2g/200mg IV every 8 hours.


Differential diagnosis
The diagnosis of lung abscess is mainly based on a detailed anamnesis, careful examination and obtaining compatible images, with radiological and microbiological studies being fundamental to reach a diagnosis of certainty. The most characteristic radiological image is usually a cavitated parenchymal infiltrate, usually with a hydro-aerial level, although multiple bilateral cavitated lesions may also appear, so it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis that includes the following entities:
- Bacterial infections: in primary lung abscesses there is almost always a risk factor for aspiration of oral contents (periodontal disease, dental abscess, dental surgery, dental surgery, substance abuse, alcoholism, epilepsy, stroke with oropharyngeal dysfunction, sinusitis, general anaesthesia, dysphagia, tracheal/nasogastric tube, severe gastrointestinal reflux disease or cerebral palsy). They are usually caused by anaerobic germs such as Prevotella spp, Bacteroides spp, Peptostreptococcus spp, Streptococcus milleri, or microaerophilic streptococci. Our patient did not present any risk factor that would lead us to think of a possible bronchoaspiration, so this aetiology was unlikely. In contrast, in secondary lung abscesses, there is usually an underlying immune compromise, as was the case in our patient. In this case, the aetiology differs from primary abscesses and may be caused by: Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli (P. aeruginosa, other enterobacteria) or opportunistic pathogens such as Nocardia spp., Legionella spp. or Rhodococcus equi.
- Fungal infections: in immunocompromised patients, as is the case here, infections caused by opportunistic fungi such as Aspergillus spp. and Zygomycetes spp. must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis.
- Embolic lesions: endocarditis over the tricuspid valve (often by Staphylococcus aureus) or in Lemièrre's syndrome, where infection starts in the pharynx, almost always by Fusobacterium necrophorum, and then spreads to the neck and carotid sheath to cause septic thrombophlebitis and multiple pulmonary embolisms, are characteristic. In our case the patient had no audible murmurs or signs of oropharyngeal infection that would lead us to suspect embolic pathology. Furthermore, pulmonary septic emboli are usually small and multiple.
- Pulmonary tuberculosis: always be aware of cavitary lesions in immunocompromised patients. Our patient had no epidemiological history and the urgently requested Ziehl-Neelsen test was negative, making this aetiology unlikely. Nevertheless, further sputum smears and mycobacterial cultures were requested and were negative.
- Cavitated pulmonary neoplasm: sometimes we are faced with a pulmonary neoplasm that has become superinfected and can cause an image similar to the one presented by this patient. In addition, the edges of the lesion were thick and irregular and the patient had a history of having been a smoker. In our case, FNA of the lesion was performed and did not demonstrate the presence of malignant cells.
- In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, we may find cavitated nodules that may lead us to think that we are dealing with a lung abscess, which is why it is important to take a detailed clinical history with all the patient's medical history. Our patient had no systemic symptoms compatible with the aforementioned entities.

Evolution
During the first days of admission to the ward, the patient continued to be febrile, with a maximum temperature of 39oC. The continuous foul-smelling and putrid expectoration was noteworthy despite empirical antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures performed in the ED were negative, as was the antigenuria for Legionella spp and S. pneumoniae, and the sputum culture showed abundant gram-negative bacilli. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast and a regular fibrobronchoscopy were requested. After 6 days of treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2g/200 mg IV every 8 hours, Bordetella bronchiseptica was identified in the sputum. After a systematic review of the available literature and before knowing the sensitivity, treatment was started with levofloxacin (500 mg/12 h iv) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (800/160 mg/8h iv), as both had good intracellular activity and synergy. On the seventh antibiogram was available showing resistance to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefepime and aztreoman. The patient remained completely afebrile from the start of combination therapy, with a progressive decrease in expectoration. Chest CT scan showed a cavitated lesion in the postero-superior location of the left lower lobe measuring 8 cm dc x 6 cm ap x 8 cm transverse with a scarce hydroaerial level and relatively thick walls surrounded by an area of alveolar consolidation extending caudally towards postero-basal segments, where thickening of the septa and bronchial walls could also be seen. In the lingula there was another small focus of consolidation in the peribronchial area, the findings being compatible with the clinical diagnosis of lung abscess with a small satellite inflammatory focus. 
Chest CT scan with intravenous contrast: cavitated lesion in the left lower lobe with thick walls and minimal hydro-aerial level.
Chest CT scan with intravenous contrast (coronal section): large cavitated lesion in left lower lobe with associated alveolar consolidation extending caudally.
Fibrobronchoscopy was normal, and samples were sent to microbiology and pathology where no neoplastic cells were found and the culture of the samples was negative. Following the CT findings, CT-guided percutaneous drainage was requested, obtaining scant purulent material in which Streptococcus constellatus, resistant only to erythromycin, was identified, Therefore, after thirteen days of intravenous treatment with levofloxacin plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, treatment was simplified to levofloxacin 750mg orally, and the patient remained afebrile and presented normal acute phase reactants at discharge three days after starting oral treatment. Treatment with levofloxacin was maintained until he was reviewed 2 weeks later in the outpatient infectious diseases department. At this time he showed a clear radiological improvement (control chest X-ray at the end of treatment) and was completely asymptomatic, so treatment was discontinued. The total duration of treatment was 36 days.

Final diagnosis
Lung abscess due to Bordetella bronchiseptica and Streptococcus constellatus in a patient with HIV C2 infection.
