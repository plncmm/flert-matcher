HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
56-year-old male, no allergies, ex-smoker and paranoid schizophrenia treated in the past with ECT and multiple antipsychotics. He was found unconscious by his brother; on arrival of the ambulance he presented blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg with O2 saturation of 65%, temperature 34.8 °C. On auscultation he had crackles and rhonchi in both lung fields. Orotracheal intubation was performed and catecholamine perfusion (noradrenaline and adrenaline) was started. On arrival at the emergency department, a cardiological assessment was requested for an electrocardiogram (ECG) suggestive of inferolateral infarction. The ECG showed a nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and rSR morphology of V2-V6 with the last R tied to the ST. Echocardioscopy with preserved left ventricular (LV) function and no segmental alterations. Laboratory tests described in evidence. The chest X-ray was compatible with multilobar pneumonia. Cardiology maintained a wait-and-see attitude and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of the respiratory infectious process.  

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Arrival ECG: nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and rSR morphology of V2-V6 with the last R tied to the ST.
ECG after temperature correction: virtual disappearance of Osborn waves, returning to normal sinus rhythm.
ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, haematocrit 41.6%, leukocytes 1700x10^3/μl, neutrophils 93.3%, platelets 133,000x10^3/μl. Coagulation: INR 1.61, IQ 52%, PT 17.1, APTT 42.9, D-dimer 708 ngr/ml.
BIOCHEMISTRY: glucose 163 mg/dl, urea 57 mg/dl, creatinine 0.39 mg/dl, GFR MDRD4; 60 ml/min/1.73m2, sodium 127 mm/l, potassium 4.4 mm/l, magnesium 2.2 mm/l. Creatine kinase 672 U/L. Lactate 2.37 mm/l. Procalcitonin 0.96 ng/ml. Troponin I < 0.01 ng/dl. CK-MB mass 139.93 ng/ml. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.29. pCO2 67 mmHg. pO2 42 mmHg. HCO3 32.2 mm/l. Base excess 3.36 mm/l.
THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: compatible with multilobar pneumonia (image 2).
ECOCARDIOSCOPY: non-dilated left ventricle with preserved function. No segmental alterations of contractility. No aortic valvulopathy. Minimal mitral insufficiency. Right chambers with normal morphology and function. No intracardiac effusion or masses.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
The team of intensivists requested a new assessment of the patient due to doubts about the decision taken by cardiology. After re-evaluating the electrocardiograms, a new patient temperature was requested, which was undetectable at the time. The patient was gradually warmed with thermal blankets and warm saline. At 32 °C, partial correction of the waves is observed, which disappear completely at 36 °C. A diagnosis of Osborn waves due to hypothermia and acidosis was made. The patient finally died of respiratory failure.

DIAGNOSIS
Community-acquired multilobar pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure. Hypothermia and acidosis, with Osborn waves on electrocardiogram. Preserved left ventricular function, no structural heart disease. Death.
