Background
We report the clinical case of a 74-year-old white female patient with a history of arterial hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, for which she had undergone angioplasty and stenting of the anterior descending coronary artery in the year 2000. In addition, he suffered from severe mitral insufficiency, for which he had undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve in 2001. Subsequently, he developed heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 22% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) III/IV despite optimal medical management, with a baseline electrocardiogram showing a QRS complex > 120 msec, leading to a decision to place a St. Jude cardiac resynchroniser programmed in VVT in April 2004. During this procedure, 2 grams of cephalothin was administered prophylactically, with a good response.

Clinical picture
The patient consulted 4 years after resynchroniser implantation (2008) for 3 consecutive days of progressive dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and fever. On admission, he presented with a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 x", axillary temperature of 38.5oC, oxygen saturation of 78%, moderate dyspnoea, no jugular ingurgitation and generalised hypoventilation with bibasal rales. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion and blood tests showed: leucocytes = 16,700 x mm3 with 96% neutrophilia; haemoglobinemia of 11.3 g/dl; platelets = 404,000 x mm3; creatinine = 1,000 x mm3; haemoglobinemia of 11.3 g/dl; platelets = 404,000 x mm3; creatinine = 1,000 x mm3; and blood tests showed: leucocytes = 16,700 x mm3 with 96% neutrophilia; haemoglobinemia of 11.3 g/dl; platelets = 404. 000 x mm3; creatininemia 2.2 mg/dl; blood sodium = 150 mmol/L; kalaemia = 4.2 mmol/L; INR = 3.4; CRP = 47 mg/dl. Due to the clinical picture, intravenous vasodilators and diuretics and water restriction were started, with good response. A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on suspicion of infective endocarditis as the patient persisted with fever, finding a mobile mass attached to the resynchroniser electrode (Figure 1). Treatment was started with piperacillin and tazobactam 2.25 grams intravenous every 6 hours + vancomycin 1 gram intravenous initially and subsequent doses according to trough levels. Blood cultures were positive for multisensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic therapy was administered for 6 weeks with a very good response, so it was decided not to remove the resynchroniser lead or the mitral valve. The control echocardiogram at 6 weeks showed resolution of the mass adherent to the electrode.
