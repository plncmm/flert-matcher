An 89-year-old woman, with no known history, consulted for a 15-day history of fever of 39 degrees, asthenia, adynamia, urinary symptoms in the last week, medicated with ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours until the day before hospitalisation, who, due to persistent thermal rises, went to the emergency room.
Physical examination findings: pale conjunctivae, tachycardic, rhythmic, normo-phonemic heart sounds, regurgitant murmur in mitral focus II/VI, non-radiated, with abdominal distention, fighting sounds, palpable mass of 4 x 4 cm in the left iliac fossa.

Laboratory on admission: leukocytes: 13,300mm3, neutrophils 77%, haemoglobin: 6.8mg/dl, haematocrit: 21.6mg/dl, ESR: 109MM, CRP: (++). Urine culture and blood cultures were performed, and a CT scan of the abdomen was requested, which revealed the presence of a bilobulated formation of apparent gynaecological origin, which to the left showed an image suggestive of a fistula with a loop of small intestine, with oral contrast substance inside the lesion. With a presumptive diagnosis of perforated tumour with intestinal fistula, the patient was taken to the operating theatre and antibiotic treatment was started, covering the abdominal focus.
As the patient continued to be febrile, together with positive blood culture results for Escherichia coli, an echocardiogram was requested, which revealed a rounded image measuring 1.5x0.8 millimetres that could correspond to vegetation, so treatment was started with ceftriaxone plus gentamicin, with good clinical evolution, and the patient was subsequently discharged.
