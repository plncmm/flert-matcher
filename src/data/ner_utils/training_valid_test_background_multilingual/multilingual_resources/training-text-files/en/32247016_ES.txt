A patient in his fifties with no personal history went to his GP in the Marseille area on 6 March 2020, reporting fever, headache and cough with an evolution since 29 February. His company (company X) had sent him to the Central African Republic from 13 to 25 February, where he gave several management lectures over 6 days to an audience of about 30 resource managers from various ministries in the Central African Republic. Because of persistent fever and cough after 9 days of onset of symptoms, he was referred to the emergency department of a local hospital on 9 March. On examination, he presented with fever (40°C) and dyspnoea with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral basal crackles. Malaria was ruled out by microscopic observation of blood smears, as well as influenza by PCR of nasopharyngeal smear. The C-reactive protein value was 103 mg/L and the leucocyte count 8.8 Giga/L. A pharyngeal swab was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR as described above and the result was positive. The patient was immediately transferred to our centre (IHU Méditerranée Infection) for hospitalisation in a highly contagious ward. A thoracic CT scan showed bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. Progressive worsening forced his temporary transfer to an intensive care unit for five days; he subsequently returned to our ward, where he remains hospitalised at the time of writing.
