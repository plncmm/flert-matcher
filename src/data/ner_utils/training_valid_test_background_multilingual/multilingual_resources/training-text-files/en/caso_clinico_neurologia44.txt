Anamnesis
A 67-year-old woman came to the emergency department with a continuous headache of 2 weeks' duration, localised at retroocular level and frontal irradiation, without accompanying vegetative symptoms, which made it difficult to rest at night and did not subside with conventional analgesia. In addition, the headache was progressively accompanied by diplopia in the previous days. She had a personal history of allergy to corticoids, arterial hypertension, pulmonary and lymph node tuberculosis treated for 9 months and ischaemic heart disease.

Physical examination
The general physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The neurological examination showed normal campimetry with limitation of abduction more important than adduction, with involvement of supra- and infraduction of the left eye1, and mild dyschromatopsia. Fundus examination revealed a papilla with sharp edges. The patient was assessed by Ophthalmology, who described a slight alteration of the macular retinal epithelium, IOP 18 mmHg, no vitritis or vasculitis.

Complementary tests
In the Emergency Department, the following tests were requested:
- Blood tests, including ionogram with hyponatraemia of 124 mmol/l and creatinine of 93 mmol/l, with normal formula and coagulation.
- Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram without alterations.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT) with no signs of parenchymal alterations, haemorrhages, masses or ventriculomegaly.
- Lumbar puncture showed 0 cells, glycorrhachia and proteinorrachia within normal values, and no gram stain, acid-fast bacilli or fungi were observed.

During hospitalisation in the neurology ward, the following tests were requested:
- Laboratory tests with immunophenotypic markers, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor and complement study, with no alterations. ANA and c-ANCA were positive at a titre of 1/80.
- Urine Bence-Jones protein was negative.
- HIV and syphilis serologies were negative.
- MRI: asymmetry of the cavernous sinuses with thickening of the wall of the left sinus, with contrast uptake in the pachymeningeum of the left middle cranial fossa, base of the skull to the pterygomaxillary fossa.
- Otolaryngological assessment: left septal dysmorphia, with bilateral free middle meatus, free sphenoethmoidal recess and normal cavum.
- High-resolution thoracic CT scan: multiple subcentimetric nodular opacities were observed, which were already present in previous studies, but some new ones were found, suggesting reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
- Abdominal CT scan with no alterations.
- Biopsy of the pterygomaxillary fossa: shows granulomatous material, fibrous tissue and inflammatory cells.

Diagnosis
After neurological examination, the case was diagnosed as cavernous sinus syndrome. Three hypotheses are put forward:
- Tuberculous reactivation. The patient had been correctly diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis and, as no mycobacteria were isolated, it was decided to extend the differential diagnosis to other granulomatous diseases.
- Neoformative process, ruled out by immunophenotypic markers and biopsy.
- Inflammatory systemic disease, which, given the presence of c-ANCA antibodies, mild renal insufficiency and images of cavernous sinus involvement with extension to the ENT territory, suggest granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's disease). However, the patient does not meet the classic criteria for Wegener's disease, although there is a strong suspicion of a limited form of the disease.

Treatment
Given the history of tuberculosis and possible corticosteroid allergy, it was decided not to start empirical treatment. As the diagnosis approached vasculitis, the possibility of desensitisation therapy with corticosteroids was considered, but the patient was reluctant and the headache improved with conventional analgesia, although ophthalmoparesis and dyschromatopsia persisted.

Evolution
The patient was discharged with good pain control, although diplopia persisted in binocular vision. After 15 days, the patient consulted again for petechial lesions on the extremities, presenting deterioration in renal function figures, so a renal biopsy was performed, in which fibrinoid necrosis without crescents was observed, adding haemoptysis with CT images suggestive of alveolar haemorrhage. Treatment was started with cyclophosphamide and prednisone in boluses, and given the pulmonary involvement, plasmapheresis and vein-to-venous haemodiafiltration were started. After 3 weeks of treatment, the clinical remission was achieved, ocular mobility was normal and painless, and she was discharged home with outpatient check-ups. Twelve months later, due to a viral respiratory infection complicated by immunosuppression and bacterial superinfection, the patient died in the Intensive Care Unit.
