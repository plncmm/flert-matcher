Anamnesis
Male, 57 years old, smoker of 20 cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, moderate drinker and with a history of repeated dental infections without other medical-surgical diseases of interest. He presented with a rapidly progressive, non-brusque picture of approximately 72 hours of evolution, consisting of increasingly intense weakness in the left upper limb, without pain or sensory symptoms. The patient denied headache and/or cervical pain. About 20 days earlier, he reported a self-limited episode of pleuritic stabbing pain in the left costal region, radiating to the ipsilateral shoulder and the root of the upper extremity, over a period of 48 hours. Since this episode, he reported occasional productive cough with yellowish sputum and streaks of blood, accompanied by fever peaking at 38°C. He also reported weight loss. He also reported a weight loss of about 8 kg in the last 4 months associated with asthenia, without hyporexia.
Prior to the constitutional syndrome, she had suffered a dental phlegmon with abundant suppuration, treated with amoxicillin and anti-inflammatory drugs.

Physical examination
General examination: temperature 36 oC, blood pressure 174/96 mmHg, heart rate 99 bpm. Basal O2 saturation 99%. Capillary glycaemia: 250 mg/dl. Skin and mucous membranes: no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis or venipuncture. Head and neck: no palpable adenopathies. Dental caries. Chest, abdomen and extremities: normal. Neurological examination: normal cortical functions. Cranial nerves normal. Motor system: disproportionate left brachio-crural hemiparesis (0/5 ESI with global involvement of the distal and proximal musculature; 4+/5 EII). Symmetrical REM, present in all four limbs, alive (+++/++++). Bilateral flexor RCP. Sensory system: normal. Extrapyramidal and cerebellar function: normal. Gait and standing: mild paresis with IBD. Meningeal signs: absent.


Complementary tests
- Biochemistry: glycaemia 266 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin 11.3% and elevated acute phase reactants (APR) such as CRP (3.94 mg/dl); other parameters were normal.
- Haemogram: leukocytosis (14,100/μl) with neutrophilia (74.9% neutrophils), macrocytosis (MCV 102.6 fl) without anaemia and normal platelet count.
- Coagulation: normal.
- Serum microbiological study: negative for HIV, syphilis, HCV and HBV.
- Urine systemic and sediment: normal. Pulmonary study:
- Posteroanterior and lateral chest X-ray: well-defined image of consolidation in the left lower lobe (LII).
- Thoracic computed tomography (CT) with VSD: lesion measuring 5.3 x 3.4 cm located in the left lung base, with a thick wall and hydro-aerial content suggestive of lung abscess. Posteroanterior chest X-ray showing a well-demarcated consolidating image in the left lower lobe. Thoracic computed tomography image with visualisation of the lung abscess in the LII.
- Spirometry: normal.
- Microbiological study of sputum and LBA by fibrobronchoscopy: negative stains for bacteria, mycobacteria (BAAR) and fungi. Negative cultures (x2).
- Transbronchial biopsy by fibrobronchoscopy: biopsy of segment 9 of LII negative for neoplasia, compatible with abscessed inflammatory process.
- FNA guided by thoracic CT: puncture of the lung mass in segment 9 of LII with cytological study compatible with purulent material and positive bacterial culture for Streptococcus intermedius (member of the Streptococcus anginosus group). Cardiological study:
- Baseline electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, mitral P wave, with normal P-R interval and QRS, without repolarisation alterations.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram: no evidence of endocarditis or structural heart disease. Normal biventricular function. Cerebral study:
- Cranial CT with VSD: two right frontal cerebral space-occupying lesions (one cortical and one subcortical) with ring contrast uptake and perilesional oedema.
- MRI of the brain with contrast administration: subcortical lesion in the semioval centre and right frontal cortical satellite lesion, with ring-shaped contrast uptake and perilesional vasogenic oedema. The subcortical lesion shows intense restriction in diffusion sequences. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. A. Axial T1w sequence with contrast showing a right frontal subcortical lesion with ring-shaped uptake and perilesional oedema. B. Diffusion sequence showing marked restriction of the same lesion.

Diagnosis
Pyogenic abscesses of the lung and brain due to Streptococcus intermedius, with odontogenic focus.


Treatment Empirical antibiotic treatment was started with meropenem and metronidazole, replaced by ceftriaxone and metronidazole after obtaining the results of the antibiogram. However, due to the appearance of a skin rash with eosinophilia, antibiotic therapy was changed to linezolid 600 mg/12 h (3 weeks of treatment) and moxifloxacin 400 mg/24 h (90 days of treatment). During the first days it was necessary to add corticotherapy (dexamethasone) to reduce cerebral vasogenic oedema. For adequate glycaemic control, the patient required treatment with insulin therapy (insulin lispro and insulin glargine).

Evolution
The patient showed a very good clinical evolution, with complete resolution of the neurological focality after starting antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment. Subsequent follow-up studies with brain MRI showed a progressive decrease in the size of the brain abscesses until they disappeared, as well as vasogenic cerebral oedema and pulmonary abscess.
