Anamnesis
A 43-year-old man, with no known allergies, no vascular risk factors or consumption of toxic substances, who underwent surgery in 2010 for a ruptured Achilles tendon, was transferred to the Emergency Department for presenting on five occasions with a sudden loss of visual acuity in the left visual field, followed by clonic movements in the left hemibody lasting seconds, without loss of consciousness. He also reported oppressive holocranial headache, associated with nausea and vomiting. He denied fever and cranioencephalic trauma, and did not remember having presented infectious symptoms in the last few weeks.

Physical examination
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile. Good general condition. Carotids rhythmic, symmetrical, no murmurs. No goitre or adenopathy. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Bladder murmur preserved. Abdomen soft, depressible, non-painful, no masses or organomegaly, hydro-aerial sounds preserved. Extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulses present and symmetrical.
Neurological examination: conscious and oriented. Hemineglect with left asomatognosia, anosognosia and astereognosia. Normal language. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Fundus without alterations. Left homonymous hemianopsia. Unrestricted extrinsic eye movements. No facial asymmetry or alteration of lower cranial pairs. Muscle balance 5/5 in all muscle groups. Normal muscle tone and trophism. Generalised osteotendinous reflexes 2/4. Bilateral cutaneous-plantar flexor reflex. Sensitivity preserved. No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Romberg negative. Normal gait. No meningeal signs.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory data: normal haemogram and coagulation. Ionogram, glycaemia, renal function, liver function and iron metabolism without findings. Normal thyroid hormones.
Tumour markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, Ca 125, Ca 15.3, Ca 19.9, alpha-fetoprotein and PSA) without alterations. Angiotensin converting enzyme 25.3 (20-60); rheumatoid factor 27.3 IU/ml (< 20); C3 152 mg/dl (75-135); C4 27 mg/dl (14-60); IgG, IgM and IgA normal; ANA negative; IgA transglutaminase 0.30 UA/l (< 10); beta-2-microglobulin 1.8 mg/dl. ESR 12 (0-20).
- Chest X-ray: increased hilarity. Cardiothoracic index in the normal range. No infiltrates or signs of pleural effusion.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): ill-defined subcortical right parietooccipital hypodense area with dubious pathological contrast uptake.
- Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): right temporo-occipital lesion hyperintense in T2 and FLAIR with extension to the corpus callosum and the contralateral hemisphere, with ependymal infiltration. Irregular stippled enhancement after contrast administration. Brain MRI, FLAIR sequence. Hyperintense temporo-occipital lesion with extension to the corpus callosum and the contralateral hemisphere.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study: red blood cells 30/mcl, cells < 5/mcl. IgG 2.73 mg/dl (0-3.40); IgM 0.05 mg/dl (0-1.30), albumin 15.9 mg/dl (0-35); Tibbling index for IgG 1.05 (0.30-0.70); IgM index 0.14 (0.02-0.10). Specific CSF bands for IgG; beta-2-microglobulin 2 mg/l (1-1); angiotensin converting enzyme 25.3 ACE units (20-60); adenosine deaminase (ADA) 2.7 IU/l (0.5-3); glucose 0.69 g/l (0.45-0.80); total protein 232 mg/l (75-320); L-lactate 197 mg/l (110-210).
- Microbiological study: negative serology for syphilis, Brucella, Toxoplasma, Rickettsia, Borrelia, HIV, HBV and HCV, VZV, CMV, EBV, HSV and HV6, in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sterile culture in CSF.
- Spectroscopy: image not suggestive of tumour tissue.
- Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT): bilateral and symmetrical uptake of bilateral mediastinal and hilar adenopathies that appear to be of inflammatory or infectious origin. No brain uptake is observed.
- Chest computed tomography (CT): bilateral mediastinal and hilar adenopathies at the limit of normality of probable infectious or granulomatous origin.
- Fibrobronchoscopy: puncture of the adenopathies, obtaining a sample for pathological anatomy, which reported a smear with the presence of bronchial wall and lymph node, in which a reactive pattern with granulomas was observed.

Diagnosis
Sarcoidosis with neurological (diffuse white matter lesion) and pulmonary manifestations (stage I according to radiological classification). Secondary focal epilepsy of the right temporal lobe.

Treatment and evolution
During hospitalisation, after initiation of valproate at a dose of 1,500 mg daily, the patient had no new epileptic seizures. The headache, the campimetric defect and the sensory-perceptual disturbances subsided spontaneously, and he was asymptomatic at the time of discharge. Once the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by histological study, and tumour aetiology was ruled out, treatment with prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks was indicated, and the parenchymal lesion disappeared in the control neuroimaging.
