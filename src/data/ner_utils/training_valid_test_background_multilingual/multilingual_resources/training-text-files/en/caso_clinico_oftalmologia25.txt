A 64 year old woman with no previous history of interest presented with a decrease in VA in OD of one week's duration. The VA was 0.2 in the OD and 0.9 in the OI. The anterior pole was normal in AO. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mmHg and the pupils were isochoric and normoreactive in AO. Examination of the right FO revealed papillary oedema and macular star.

In view of the clinical suspicion of neuroretinitis, we performed a series of tests including a complete blood count, basic biochemistry, ESR, CRP, chest X-ray and cranial CT scan. We also requested a complete biochemistry, coagulation, rheumatic tests, immunoglobulins, Mantoux intradermal reaction, proteinogram, gamma globulins, ANA, ENA, ANCA and ECA and serology: toxoplasma, bartonella, HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, HSV, EBV, LUES, borrelia, chlamydia, histoplasmosis, toxocara and rose bengal. Funduscopic examination of the OD revealed papillary oedema and macular star; the OI was normal. Fluorescein angiography showed "screen effect" lesions with late hyperfluorescence around them. The systemic study of this patient was normal. Western blot serology was positive for bartonella and she was put on oral treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours for 3 weeks. The evolution was favourable and he experienced a remarkable VA recovery (OD = 0.9).
