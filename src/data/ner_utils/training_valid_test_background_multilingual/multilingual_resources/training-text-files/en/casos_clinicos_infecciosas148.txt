Male patient aged 43, from Santa Cruz (Bolivia), resident in Spain for 15 years, smoker of 15 packets/year, sporadic drinker. His personal history included neurocysticercosis diagnosed and treated in his country of origin in 2002 with two 21-day cycles of albendazole (800 mg every 12 hours), without follow-up, and treated with phenytoin since then. He visited the neurology department, referred from primary care, for episodes of haemicranial headache of one year's duration, with a frequency of 2-3 episodes per month that subsided with anti-inflammatory analgesia, as well as an episode of paraesthesia and loss of strength in the right hemibody lasting 5 minutes with total and spontaneous recovery. She denied risky sexual relations, as well as any other symptoms.
No significant findings were found in the examination by apparatus and systems. In view of these symptoms, the Neurology Department requested the following complementary tests:
- Haemogram: normality of the three series. Biochemistry: liver function, renal function and acute phase reactants were normal.
- Microbiology: - HIV serology: negative; Taenia solium serology: positive; Trypanosoma cruzi serology (Elisa IgG and IFI IgG): positive; Syphilis serology: RPR negative, T. pallidum IgG positive; Toxoplasma serology: IgG and IgM negative; Echinoccocus granulosus serology: negative. - Mantoux test: negative.
- Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): thick-walled cystic lesions with hyperdense and hypercapitate punctate image in the frontal, parietal and left occipital region, without perilesional oedema or diffusion restriction.
- Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no condensation or effusion, no bone pathology. In view of these findings, the patient was referred to the Infectious Diseases Department for treatment and follow-up.


Differential diagnosis
Given the patient's clinical manifestations, the epidemiological factors and the results of the complementary tests obtained, a differential diagnosis can be made between the following nosological entities:
- Tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS). Tuberculoma: CNS involvement in tuberculosis can present in different ways. For example, as tuberculous meningitis, usually manifesting subacutely, which is not consistent with the clinical picture of our patient. However, it can also present as a tuberculoma, which are usually solid (non-cystic) lesions with perilesional oedema, and is also a rare entity in immunocompetent patients.
- Brain abscess. Symptoms of bacterial brain abscess usually consist of fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and neck stiffness of relatively acute onset. On MRI, the abscess appears as a hypointense, ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesion on T1. On T2 it shows a central hyperintense area (pus) surrounded by a well-defined hypointense capsule, which in turn is surrounded by oedema.
- Cerebral hydatidosis. CNS involvement can lead to coma or intracranial hypertension, which would be compatible with our case, but serology for Echinococcus spp. was negative.
- Chagas disease with CNS involvement. The most frequent involvement of the CNS is in the form of a space-occupying mass, a pseudotumour or "chagoma", and it may also manifest as acute meningoencephalitis, less frequently. Our patient had a positive Chagas serology; however, central nervous system involvement in this entity is mainly seen in patients with a high level of immunosuppression, such as HIV-infected patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 100 cells/μL or transplant recipients undergoing potent immunosuppressive treatment.
- Neurosyphilis. There are different forms of presentation of neurosyphilis, asymptomatic neurosyphilis (only CSF alterations) and symptomatic neurosyphilis, which includes meningeal syphilis (headache, neck stiffness, coma, etc.), meningo vascular syphilis (headache, neck stiffness, coma, etc.), meningeal vascular syphilis (headache, neck stiffness, coma, etc.) and meningo vascular syphilis (headache, neck stiffness, etc.). ), the meningovascular form (which simulates a middle cerebral artery stroke with typical encephalitis prodrome) and the parenchymal form, which can present as a progressive general paralysis (subacute dementia, neuropsychiatric disorders...) or tabes dorsalis (spinal cord involvement, demyelination of posterior cords...). The clinical features of the case we present are not consistent with neurosyphilis, however the patient had a negative RPR serological pattern and T. pallidum IgG positive, compatible with late syphilis or syphilis with more than one year of evolution, tertiary syphilis (neurosyphilis) or treated syphilis. Therefore, although clinically unlikely, it is a diagnostic possibility that should be ruled out by CSF analysis (CSF VDRL).
- Cerebral toxoplasmosis. CNS involvement in toxoplasmosis consists of encephalitis and abscess formation. The most frequent symptoms are headache and fever, which appear in half of the patients, and mental confusion and sensory-motor deficits occur as a consequence of the neurological damage. It is usually seen in immunosuppressed patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (HIV with advanced immunosuppression, patients with haematological malignancies and chemotherapy or solid organ transplant recipients). These patients almost all have a positive serology for IgG and negative for specific IgM. As we have already mentioned, our patient is immunocompetent, and also has a negative serology for toxoplasma, making this a very unlikely diagnostic option.
- Cryptococcosis of the brain. Cryptococcosis is one of the most frequent and serious fungal infections associated with HIV, with a CD4 lymphocyte count below 100 cells/μl acting as a predisposing factor. In more than 75% of cases, subacute meningitis or meningoencephalitis occurs with fever, malaise, little or no meningeal signs and headache. In 10-15%, space-occupying lesions, cryptococcomas, single or multiple, enhancing or non-enhancing, solid or ring-like, usually in the basal ganglia or thalamus, may occur.
- Non-infectious causes of nodular lesions with peripheral uptake in the CNS (metastasis, lymphoma, primary tumour, etc.).
- Neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is the involvement of the CNS by the parasitic form of Taenia solium larvae, with humans acting as intermediate hosts, which clinically presents with epilepsy, intracranial hypertension and focal neurological signs. Radiological findings depend on larval stage, number and location. Parenchymal involvement is the most frequent form, and the cysts are mainly located in the cerebral cortex, with different stages of evolution from viable cysts (with scolex) to the final evolutionary stage with calcification. Positive serology and radiological imaging make this the most likely diagnosis.

Evolution
The patient was seen in the Infectious Diseases department where he reported the same symptoms as previously described and the results of the complementary tests requested by neurology were reviewed. MRI images were evaluated together with an expert radiologist, describing the results as findings compatible with active neurocysticercosis. A fundus examination was requested to rule out ocular involvement, and the diagnosis of active neurocysticercosis was established, as the patient had cystic lesions with scolex on the MRI (absolute criterion), as well as positive serology for T. solium (major criterion). Stool parasites were requested in order to rule out autoinoculation, and were negative. Regarding the serological pattern of syphilis (RPR negative, T. pallidum IgG positive), a lumbar puncture was proposed to the patient, who refused the examination as he denied risky sexual relations, and referred to the history of having been treated in the past with three doses of intramuscular benzathine penicillin for an episode of syphilis, assuming the diagnosis of treated syphilis. With regard to the positive Chagas serology, the patient denied gastrointestinal symptoms, presented chest X-ray without cardiomegaly, echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were requested, both normal, and PCR for T. cruzi was negative, leading to a diagnosis of Chagas disease of undetermined duration.
Admission to the Infectious Diseases ward was indicated for combined treatment. Albendazole 400 mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks and praziquantel 600 mg 2 tablets at breakfast, 2 tablets at lunch and 3 tablets at dinner for 4 weeks were prescribed. In addition, treatment was started with dexamethasone 2 mg every 12 hours, beginning 24 hours before the start of deworming therapy, and phenytoin was replaced by levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours to avoid interactions. After 48 hours of antiparasitic treatment, he presented two episodes of partial secondary generalised seizures with tongue biting and subsequent amnesia, so the dose of levetiracetam was increased to 1000 mg every 12 hours. After 7 days of hospitalisation, with no new complications, the patient was discharged from hospital for outpatient follow-up. She completed the treatment without incident and with good tolerance to the medication. She had no new seizures. Brain MRI and serology for T. solium were requested 6 months after completing treatment. The MRI showed scar lesions with no activity and T. solium serology was negative. Given these results and the absence of neurological symptoms, neurocysticercosis was assumed to be cured.
Annual follow-up with T. solium serology was indicated. Once treatment for neurocysticercosis was completed, outpatient treatment of Chagas disease was started with benznidazole 15 mg/kg/day in ascending doses, until 270 tablets were completed, with very good tolerance to treatment and annual follow-up with ECG and Chagas PCR, and the patient was found to be asymptomatic one year later, with no new seizures and negative Chagas PCR.

Final diagnosis
- Active parenchymal neurocysticercosis.
- Chagas disease of undetermined duration.
- Syphilis treated.
