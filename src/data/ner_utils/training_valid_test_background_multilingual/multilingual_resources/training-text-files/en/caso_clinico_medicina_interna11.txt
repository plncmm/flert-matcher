A 75 year old male patient with a personal history of hypertension, chronic renal failure on haemodialysis and a prosthesis for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Six years after implantation, he had episodes of digestive haemorrhage associated with prosthetic-duodenal fistula.

An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was requested to rule out prosthetic infection, showing increased periprosthetic uptake in the portion of the abdominal aorta located between L2-L3. The tract measures about 4 cm and has a SUVmax of 6.7 in the anterior wall, which is thickened (normal aortic SUV: 2.6), probably related to an infectious/inflammatory process at that level.

Subsequent CT angiography showed an aneurysmal aorta of 4 cm in diameter with a penetrating subrenal ulcer 7.7 mm high and 5.5 mm deep, as well as aneurysmal engulfment of both iliac territories.

It was decided to perform a vascular bypass by means of a left axillo-bifemoral bypass. In the immediate postoperative period he presented episodes of haematemesis and syncope. Emergency surgery was performed with removal of the prosthesis and section of the aortoduodenal fistula.

Pathological anatomy showed a tubular segment of prosthetic material measuring 9 Ã— 3 cm, with coagulated haematic material inside and fibrinoid debris adhering to it, where ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus avium was isolated.

Therefore, 18F-FDG PET/CT has proven to be a sensitive and useful technique in the diagnostic orientation of infectious processes in vascular prostheses.
