No weight loss, night sweats or haemoptysis.
Chest X-ray was requested.

Nodular opacities of ill-defined contours in both lung fields. Shoulder arthroplasty.

Consolidation foci with air bronchogram and ground glass in the periphery. No lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion.

Consolidation foci showing increased size and confluence within 1 month.

Differential diagnoses
- Drug toxicity (Methotrexate).
- Fungal infection (Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Blastomycosis).
- Atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma).
- Sarcoidosis.
- Tuberculosis.
- Septic embolism.

Other findings
Culture negative for bacteria and fungi.
BAL negative for acid fast bacilli, CMV, HSV, Legionella, Pneumocystis, Adenovirus.
Urine positive for Histoplasma antigen.

Biopsy results
Lung biopsy was performed showing necrotizing granulomas with small yeasts which confirmed pulmonary Histoplasmosis.

PATHOLOGY
Transbronchial biopsy of the right lower lobe.
-Patchy organised pneumonia with mild acute and chronic interstitial inflammation.
-Poorly formed granulomatous isolates.
-Numerous yeast formations, consistent with Histoplasma, apparently with alveolar macrophages.
