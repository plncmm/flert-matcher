Anamnesis
A 59-year-old man, with no known allergies or adverse reactions to medication, with a history of arterial hypertension on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril. He consulted for lesions on the face and trunk of almost 4 months' duration, not pruritic or painful, which did not respond to treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids. She reports no fever or other associated symptoms. He denies ingestion of new drugs, recent travel or insect bites.

Physical examination
Multiple erythematous-violaceous papules and plaques were observed in the frontal region, ill-defined, measuring
1 to 2 cm in size, very infiltrated and not painful on palpation. There was also a maculopapular and erythematous rash on the neck, anterior chest and upper back. No palmoplantar or mucosal involvement was observed, nor were cervical or axillary lymphadenopathies or visceromegaly palpable.

Complementary examinations
A skin biopsy was performed, which showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate in the basal lamina with a tendency to epidermotropism, and also a perivascular infiltrate in the superficial and deep dermis. Immunohistochemistry showed marked positivity for CD20 and less for CD3. No light chain restriction was observed.

Treponeme staining in skin biopsy, serum VDRL and treponemal IgG and IgM tests were positive.

Diagnosis
Secondary pseudolymphomatoid syphilis.

Treatment
Benzathine penicillin 2.4 million i.m. was administered.

Evolution
After antibiotic therapy, a rapid clinical improvement was observed, with complete resolution of the skin lesions.
