Anamnesis
A 46-year-old woman, with no known adverse drug reactions, ex-smoker, hypertensive on treatment with ramipril 5 mg/day (with good control) and dyslipidaemia on dietary treatment as the only personal history of interest, who since 2006 presented with tingling in the left hand and foot. In September 2008 he began to experience progressive clumsiness in his left lower limb. Since then she has stopped driving because she cannot feel the pedal and when going down stairs she has to watch where she is leaning to avoid falling. She has suffered several sprains. She also reports that when she eats she has to squeeze objects and look at them in order to put them correctly in her mouth. She denies loss of strength. She reports alternating episodes of diarrhoea with constipation, dry mouth and generalised arthralgias.

Physical examination
Normal fundoscopy. Higher functions preserved. No campimetric defects on confrontation. Mid pupils reactive to light. Normal pursuit and saccadic eye movements. Rest of cranial nerves normal. Normal balance, tone and muscle trophism. Sensibility: hypoaesthesia and hypoalgesia in the left upper limb up to the upper third of the forearm and in the left lower limb up to the proximal third of the thigh with dysaesthetic sensations. Vibratory present in left fingers and left knee, normal in right limbs. Positional present in left elbow and knee, normal in right limbs. No sensory extinction. Generalised arreflexia except for hypoactive right tricipital. Bilateral cutaneous-plantar flexor reflex. Pseudoathetosis in the left upper limb. No dysmetria. Gait with increased base and pseudodystonic posture in the left lower limb. Unstable tandem. Positive Romberg (fall in 5 seconds).
Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic at 65 systoles/minute. No heart murmurs or laterocervical murmurs. No other air sounds were heard.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: normal including vitamin B12 and folic acid.
- HIV serology, luetics and hepatic markers negative.
- Negative anti-neuronal and anti-ganglioside.
- Negative ANA, antigliadin and antitransglutaminase.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): normal cytobiochemistry. Serology negative.
- Cranial and cervico-dorso-lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): normal.
- ENG: decreased amplitudes of sensory action potentials with predominance in the left limbs, being absent in the left lower limb, preserving conduction velocities. Motor action potentials are normal. F waves present normal characteristics and latencies. The H response on the left side over the soleus is abolished and a very low amplitude response is obtained on the right side.
- Thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT): normal.
- Positron emission tomography (PET): normal.
- Schirmer's test: pathological (< 10 mm). Lacrimal hyposecretion.
- Salivary gland biopsy: no histological alterations.
- Biopsy of the sural nerve: axonal degeneration, regeneration cluster and loss of myelinated fibres.

Diagnosis
Asymmetric sensory neuronopathy of undetermined aetiology. Possible SjÃ¶gren's disease.

Treatment
Treatment with prednisone at 1 mg/kg body weight was started.

Evolution
During the 7 years of evolution the clinical worsening of the patient has been progressive, without the treatment prescribed having served to improve or prevent the progression of the disease. She shows increasing difficulty in manipulating objects or buttoning her buttons, and great difficulty in handling her left leg. The patient continues to have significant ocular and oral dryness, requiring her to drink large amounts of water daily.
