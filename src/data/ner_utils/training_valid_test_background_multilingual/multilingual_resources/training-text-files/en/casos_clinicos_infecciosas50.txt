A 34-year-old male from Gambia attended the Infectious Diseases outpatient clinic for the first time in November 2012, referred by ENT for a nasal lesion and tonsillar pillars compatible with rhinoscleroma.  Personal history included the presence, since the age of 20, of a wound in the nose, in the upper part of the nasal septum, which oozed contents without a foul odour, treated in his country, which took about two months to heal and years later, rhinorrhoea and a sensation of nasal obstruction reappeared. He also presented occasional nocturnal tremors for 3-4 years, which he interpreted as fever.
The patient was a Gambian national, with a migratory route: Gambia-Libya-Italy-Spain (2010). He lives with 4 people in acceptable hygienic-social conditions. No known drug allergies.

He came for consultation, referred from ENT, due to a nasal lesion and a lesion on the roof of the tonsillar pillars, biopsies of which were taken and where it was demonstrated, by anatomopathological study, the presence of Mikulicz cells harbouring coco-bacillary bacterial structures, and a suspected diagnosis of rhinoscleroma without microbiological diagnosis. At the time of this first visit, the patient presented permanent rhinorrhoea and a sensation of nasal obstruction that prevented him from breathing properly.

Physical examination revealed scarring in the upper nasal area. Absence of uvula. Small palatine tonsils. The rest of the examination showed no significant findings.

Complementary tests:
- Haemoglobin 14g/dL, MCV 99, Leukocytes 5.48x103/μL (Neutrophils 2.99x103 /μL), Platelets 187x103 /μL. ESR 4 mm/h.
- Biochemistry: Normal hepatorenal profile. CRP 0.00 mg/dL. Total protein 7.58 g/dL. Antistreptolysin 55 U/mL, Rheumatoid factor 9.7 U/mL.
- Serologies: Negative for Brucella, Cytomegalovirus, Lúes, HIV and Hepatitis C. IgG 3.6 for Epstein-Barr virus, IgG 354 and IgM 0.65 for Toxoplasma. HBsAg negative AntiHBc positive, AntiHBs positive.
- Sputum culture: Development of oropharyngeal flora. BAAR are not observed. No mycobacterial growth.
- Chest X-ray: Normal cardiothoracic index. No infiltrate or condensation.
- CT scan of the paranasal sinuses: Occupation by soft tissue of both nostrils, causing expansion of these nostrils, as well as demineralisation and loss of definition of the cartilages of the turbinates. Nasal septum displaced to the left. Polypoid lesions. Referred back to ENT for surgical cleaning and taking of samples for microbiological study, and the patient did not return to the clinic until 2015.

Differential diagnosis
The initial differential diagnosis would include fungal infections, granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, leprosy, vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis or verrucous carcinoma as well as basal cell carcinoma and other infections such as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, rhinosporidiosis, sporotrichosis, blastomycosis and paracoccidiodomycosis.

Evolution
The patient did not attend for a check-up, as he had to travel for work reasons and the follow-up was lost. Three years later he reappeared at the clinic with the same problem. It is not clear whether he has been treated. He was assessed again by the ENT, this time taking samples for microbiological study, where Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis were isolated. Negative culture for mycobacteria. Both pathogens were sensitive, according to the antibiogram, to Ciprofloxacin, so treatment was decided with this antibiotic, at a dose of 500mg every 12 hours for 6 months, with close follow-up with primary care to monitor tolerance and adherence.

Final diagnosis
Both microbiological and anatomopathological data point to Rhinoscleroma.
