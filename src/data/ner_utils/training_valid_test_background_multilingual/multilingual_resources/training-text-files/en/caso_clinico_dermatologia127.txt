Anamnesis
A 40-year-old male patient, HIV+, referred by the Infection Service for lesions in the genital area. The patient describes an initial single lesion of one month's evolution in the perineum area treated with betamethasone/gentamicin cream, which does not disappear after 10 days of application, adding new lesions, and coinciding with throat discomfort and oral aphthae. Subsequently, treatment with systemic and topical famciclovir was started on suspicion of Herpes Simplex, but no improvement was achieved.

Physical examination
Erythematous scaly plaques were seen on the scrotum and shaft of the penis and erythematous papular lesions of approximately 6-10 mm with an eroded centre in the bilateral inguinal region.

Complementary examinations
Serology for syphilis, PCR for other STIs and stool culture were requested, which were negative.
Histopathological examination revealed spongiosis with exocytosis of neutrophils and lymphocytes and apoptotic keratinocytes at different levels. The granular layer is absent in some areas, coinciding with parakeratosis. In the dermis there is an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphohistiocytic cells, with some plasma cells, arranged around small vessels of the superficial capillary and interstitial plexus with a tendency to band-like arrangement.

Diagnosis
Pityriasis rosea inversa.

Treatment
Treatment with prednisone 40 mg/day was started.

Evolution
New lesions were added in the intergluteal area and there was an erythematous, chalky plaque on the scalp measuring about 2 cm in the left parietal region. One month after starting oral corticosteroids, the lesions stabilised and began to disappear without the appearance of new ones, so the corticosteroids were gradually reduced until they were discontinued.
