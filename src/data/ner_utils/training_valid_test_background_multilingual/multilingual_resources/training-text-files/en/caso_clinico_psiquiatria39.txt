The patient and her environment
Alba Vargas first consulted our mental health team at the age of 28. She had had previous sporadic contact with mental health professionals, at the ages of 15 and 17, for parasuicidal behaviour through the use of medication. She was the third of seven siblings. She had lived for years independently from her family, alone or with a partner, although in the year prior to the first consultation she returned to the family home. She had a permanent job as a manager in a furniture shop. No relevant medical history.

Pre-morbid personality with introversion traits, which the patient expresses by saying: "it is difficult for me to open up to people". The anamnesis shows persistent traumatic life events during childhood and adolescence, as well as restrictive eating behaviour without a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. The father has probable untreated alcohol dependence.

Substance use
She has been a hashish user since adolescence. In the ten years prior to the first consultation, and during the six years of psychiatric follow-up, she consumed hashish daily, usually at least three joints a day. Consumption was preferably at the end of the day in search of an anxiolytic and sleep-inducing effect. After motivational treatment, he remained abstinent for fifteen months. The four psychotic episodes described below were preceded by two to four weeks of heavy hashish use (more than fifteen joints a day), which the patient smoked in isolation in her room. She consumed no other intoxicants, except for occasional alcohol and moderate amounts of coffee and tobacco.

Clinical course and treatment
- 28 years: First psychotic episode, hallucinatory-delusional, followed by post-psychotic depression and total remission. At the time of the first consultation, she reported that for more than six months "the television has been talking about me". At that time, verbal hallucinations were observed for several hours a day, self-referential delusional perception and slight affective dullness. She had no formal thought disorders, no awareness of illness, was euthymic and had moderate anxiety reactive to psychotic phenomena. Treatment with risperidone (6 mg/day) was started, after which the positive symptoms rapidly disappeared. In the following six months, mild extrapyramidalism, weight gain of 8 kg and depressed mood appeared. The dose of risperidone was reduced to 3 mg/day and treatment with citalopram (20 mg/day) was started, which the patient discontinued after two months. Nine months after the first consultation she is asymptomatic, with no positive, negative or affective symptoms. She has had amenorrhoea for 7 months.
 - 30 years: Second psychotic episode, hallucinatory-delusional, with total remission. Two and a half years after the first episode she is still asymptomatic and working normally and is maintained on 2 mg/day of risperidone. She has undergone psychotherapy for six months, seeking better coping with interpersonal conflicts, and has psychological consultations on demand. He has a new acute psychotic episode with intense auditory and visual hallucinations. According to the family, he has spent two weeks practically without leaving his room, where he smokes hashish continuously throughout the day. This second psychotic episode ceased completely within a week after increasing the dose of risperidone to 6 mg/day with the addition of loracepam (5 mg/day). The patient is then strongly advised to stop using cannabis.
 - 31 years: Third psychotic episode, disorganised, with total remission. She is again asymptomatic for ten months, although she has requested leave from her job. She has a third acute psychotic episode with significant language and behavioural disorganisation. It was confirmed that she had abandoned treatment and had increased her consumption of hashish. She was admitted and her symptoms completely resolved within a few days.
 - 32 years old: Transitory withdrawal. Four and a half years after the first acute psychotic episode, she began cannabis withdrawal in outpatient therapeutic groups. She is totally asymptomatic, on treatment with long-term injectable risperidone (50 mg every 15 days). Back to work. Remains totally abstinent from cannabis use for 15 months.
 - 34 years: Relapse in use. The family reports that the patient has started smoking hashish again. She is going through a period of emotional problems. The patient confirms that she has gone back to smoking two or three joints at night "to sleep well and be calm after work" as she has problems with her current partner. Her speech is discreetly slowed down and she has slight hypomimia. However, she remains free of signs of psychotic symptoms for 14 months. He is well maintained on long-term injectable risperidone treatment (50 mg every 15 days).
 - 35 years: Fourth psychotic episode and suicide. A moderate tendency to paranoid thinking reappears, with slight disintegration of thought. Bizarre mimic expressiveness (eyes wide open and eyebrows raised during verbal expression). The patient confirms that she has resumed heavy hashish use. Depot treatment is administered. Two weeks later she has improved significantly and is euthymic. One week later she commits suicide by hanging in a context suggesting hours of planning and probable confusional-oniric symptoms prior to suicide.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
Throughout the course of the evolution, repeated analytical studies were carried out, which were normal, EEG normal. Urine toxicity tests were positive for cannabis on several occasions, and negative for other substances. At the age of 31, while she was asymptomatic, a neuropsychological study was carried out, which is summarised in Table 1. Due to the close temporal relationship between the increase in hashish consumption and the appearance of psychotic episodes, together with the rapid and total remission of symptoms after treatment, the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of (F12.52) cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations was made.
The episode with transient depressive symptoms that appeared after the first psychotic episode led to the suspicion of a development towards a schizoaffective disorder, which was not confirmed in the following years.
