A 51 year old woman, allergic to penicillin and derivatives, with no other history of interest, who came to the emergency department due to the appearance of an erythematous, pruritic and slightly scaly plaque on the dorsum of the left hand. The patient was referred to the dermatology department. Physical examination revealed an erythematous plaque with peripheral papulovesicles, scaling in some areas, isolated scratching lesions and a central erosion compatible with a traumatic wound in the process of healing.
In the two weeks prior to consultation, the patient had applied tea tree oil (in perfume for dilution) daily to the area for the care of local traumatic wounds. In the year prior to the appearance of the lesions, she had also used the same oil, diluted in almond oil and undiluted, intermittently every 4-20 days on different areas of the face, for a variable time of 2-5 days, for the treatment of non-specific lesions.
The biopsy shows a spongiotic dermatitis. Subsequently, patch tests were performed with allergens from the Spanish Research Group on Dermatitis and Cutaneous Allergy (GEIDAC), cosmetics, perfumes (Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Vellinge, Sweden) and essential oil, with positive results (++) at 48 and 96 hours for tea tree oil, hydroabietic alcohol and the clinically relevant essential oil.
With the diagnosis of allergic contact eczema to tea tree oil and hydroabietic alcohol, avoidance of these allergens was recommended, and the skin lesions resolved without recurrence after cessation of use.
