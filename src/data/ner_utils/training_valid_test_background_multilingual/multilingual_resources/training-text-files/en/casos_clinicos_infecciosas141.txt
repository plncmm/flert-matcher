We present the case of a 53-year-old male smoker with HIV and HCV infection. The patient's immunovirological status was 140 CD4/μL and 6,892,470 viral RNA copies/ml. He had started antiretroviral treatment one week earlier with darunavir, cobicistat, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. He had not received treatment for HCV infection, whose last detected viral load (four years earlier) was 14,261,452 viral RNA copies/ml.
She consulted the emergency department because she had been suffering from a feeling of dystrophy for a month, which had increased in recent weeks, with daily fever and profuse sweating. She also reported epigastralgia and heartburn after eating, a feeling of fullness postprandially, early satiety and occasional diarrhoeal stools with red blood, all of which had also been going on for a month. Finally, he reported cough and whitish expectoration. On examination, the patient showed muco-cutaneous pallor and was eupneic at rest, conscious, oriented and cooperative. He was febrile (39.7 oC), with a blood pressure of 93/64 mmHg, a heart rate of 104 beats per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96% while breathing room air. Auscultation showed rhythmic tones without audible murmurs and a preserved vesicular murmur. At the lymph node level, there were palpable smooth and rounded laterocervical lymph nodes measuring approximately 1 cm, with no lymph nodes at other levels. On abdominal palpation, the abdomen was soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, with no signs of peritonism, with hydro-aerial sounds present, and hepatomegaly measuring 2 fingerbreadths was observed. The rest of the examination showed no other alterations.
Chest and abdominal X-rays showed no significant findings. The haemogram showed hypochromic microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, 7,000 leukocytes/μL (85.60% neutrophils) and 190,000 platelets/μL. Biochemistry showed: GOT 65 U/L, GPT 30 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 239 U/L, GGT 341 U/L, calcium 7.5 mg/dl and sodium 125 mmol/L. Renal function, bilirubin, lipase and urinalysis were normal. Blood cultures in aerobic and anaerobic medium obtained from the ED during the fever peak were negative. Serology for syphilis and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Detection of Clostridium difficile toxin and parasites in stool was requested, as well as stool culture, all of which were negative.
In view of the symptoms presented, it was decided to perform an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy. The abdominal CT scan showed hepatosplenomegaly, multiple hypodense lesions in the spleen compatible with microabscesses, intra- and retroperitoneal abdominal lymphadenopathy, small free ascites and segmental thickening of the cecum, non-specific, with no other findings of interest. Gastroscopy revealed a non-specific thickening of the gastric body compatible with chronic gastritis. Colonoscopy explored the entire colon in good preparation conditions, with no alterations, except for congestive internal haemorrhoids and anal fissure. A diagnostic test was performed.

Differential diagnosis
For the differential diagnosis we must take into account those processes with hepatosplenomegaly, lesions compatible with splenic microabscesses as well as multiple intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal adenopathies. Sarcoidosis may be the cause of sterile splenic microabscesses, but it is not typical in a state of cellular immunosuppression such as that of our patient. As for neoplasms, Kaposi's sarcoma may present with adenopathy and lesions resembling microabscesses, but this would be unlikely in our case given the absence of typical skin lesions. On the other hand, metastatic lesions should also be considered, but the radiological behaviour is different, and the absence of liver lesions and primary tumour, together with the normal colonoscopy, militate against this diagnosis, as well as the presence of high fever above 39o C. It is more likely that the patient has lymphoma, as it sometimes causes lesions in the spleen that can simulate microabscesses, which cannot be ruled out until a histological diagnosis is made if the microbiological studies are negative.

The microorganisms that can produce splenic microabscesses are:
- Histoplasma capsulatum
- Leishmania
- Candida albicans
- Salmonella
- Shigella
- Campylobacter jejuni
- Pneumocystis jirovecii
- Coccidioides
- Toxoplasmagondii
- Aspergillus
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis
- Mycobacterium avium complex

With regard to fungal infections, we could rule out histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis from the outset, as they are not endemic in our environment. Moreover, when these infections produce microabscesses, they do so in the context of disseminated infection with pulmonary involvement.
Aspergillus spp is also a cause of splenic microabscesses, but it usually occurs in patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/μL, and who also have neutropenia or steroid treatment, which was not the case in our patient.
We should also mention hepato-splenic candidiasis, which would be ruled out as it is typical of haematological patients in the recovery phase of neutropenia. Extrapulmonary infection by Pneumocystis jirovecii is also a cause of splenic, liver and kidney abscesses; however, it is mainly described in the context of severe pulmonary disease caused by this microorganism or in patients undergoing prophylaxis with pentamidine aerosols, data absent in our case.
On the other hand, splenic microabscesses have been described in the context of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Campylobacter spp. bacteraemia, but negative blood cultures make their diagnosis very unlikely.
Bacillary angiomatosis, another cause of splenic abscesses, is far from our diagnosis as it is characterised by typical skin lesions and lower CD4 counts than those shown by our patient. Extracerebral toxoplasmosis has been described as a rare cause of splenic abscesses. Generally, the most affected organs in case of extracerebral toxoplasmosis are the heart and lungs. It requires a high degree of immunosuppression, with less than 100 CD4/μL. The negative serology for T. gondii in our patient would rule out this entity.
Disseminated leishmaniasis has been documented as a cause of nodular splenic lesions. However, its typical presentation is with pancytopenia, which was absent in our case.
Finally, mycobacteria, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex, can cause liver and splenic abscesses with negative bacterial cultures. M. avium infection would be less likely because it usually appears in patients with CD4 counts below 50 cells/μL, on the contrary the whole clinical picture of fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with ascites, microabscesses and dissociated cholestasis, in a patient with HIV infection with more than 100 CD4/μL, makes M. tuberculosis infection the first diagnosis to be considered in our patient.

Evolution
Given the high suspicion of disseminated tuberculosis, a blood culture for mycobacteria and urine samples for smear microscopy and culture of these microorganisms were obtained, and empirical treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was started.
During the first days of treatment, the fever disappeared and the patient's general condition improved. However, on the fourth day, fever and asthenia reappeared, and he developed jaundiced skin and mucous membranes. Bilirubin increased to 6.45 mg/dL, with an increase in alkaline phosphatase and GGT, but no increase in cytolysis enzymes. Suspicion of rifampicin toxicity led to discontinuation of the tuberculostatics.
After that, the patient continued with a persistent but well-tolerated fever of around 38oC, and with an analytical improvement in liver function parameters, with a progressive decrease in cholestasis parameters. Several days later, once the analytical parameters had normalised, it was decided to restart the tuberculostatic treatment, progressively introducing the drugs, without using rifampicin this time. Treatment was started with isoniazid, which was well tolerated, so pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were added a week later.
Despite treatment, the patient continued in a similar situation, with daily fever and night sweats, although well tolerated, without any device symptoms. Therefore, naproxen was added to the treatment, after which the fever disappeared, and the patient was discharged for follow-up consultations.
After discharge, M. tuberculosis was found to grow in blood cultures for mycobacteria, resistant only to streptomycin, which was withdrawn from treatment. The patient was treated with tuberculostatics for one year with complete resolution of the clinical picture.

Final diagnosis
Disseminated tuberculosis in a patient with HIV infection with splenic microabscess formation.
