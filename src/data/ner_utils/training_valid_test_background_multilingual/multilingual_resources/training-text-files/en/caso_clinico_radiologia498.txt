A 31-year-old Nigerian male was referred to the emergency department for abdominal pain and vomiting. No abnormal blood or urine tests. Abdominal CT scan with IV contrast showed dilatation of some ileal loops and colon with liquid content, and mild thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum with an inflammatory appearance. Intraluminal structures are identified in FID, vermiform, partially coiled. Suspecting the presence of roundworms, abdominal ultrasound was performed, confirming curvilinear structures with parallel echogenic walls and a hypoechoic tubular centre compatible with Ascaris Lumbricoides. A stool parasite study was requested and the patient was treated with Mebendazole 100mg every 12 hours for 3 days.
