Histopathology

Skin biopsy showed epidermal hyperplasia with horny pustules, dermis with diffuse chronic inflammation rich in plasmacytes with epithelioid granulomas rich in giant cells and some polymorphonuclear cells in its centre, abscesses passing from the dermis to the infundibulae. Haematoxylin-eosin ×2.5 (A) and ×40 (B). Epidermal hyperplasia. Dermis with diffuse chronic inflammation rich in plasmacytes, with granulomas rich in giant cells and some neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells.

Other complementary tests

Direct examination and culture for Leishmania were negative. Culture for deep mycosis on Sabouraud agar and potato dextrose agar (PDA), after 10 days incubation at 25°C, was positive for Sporothrix schenckii. Sporothrix schenckii culture. On Sabouraud agar and potato dextrose at 25°C, after 10 days incubation.

The yeast-like phase on Seneca agar (nutrient agar for isolation of Leishmania spp.) was observed after 15 days of incubation. Microscopic imaging of the mycelial phase showed sympodial daisy-shaped conidiation. Yeast-like phase on Seneca agar, after 15 days incubation.
