Infant aged 1 month and 25 days consulted for cough and mucus for 5 days, with the addition of fever for the last 3 days (maximum of 37.8Â°C). Today respiratory difficulty was added, accompanied by wheezing, she went to the centre and was prescribed salbutamol by inhalation. Mother persists with respiratory difficulty and goes to the emergency department.

PERSONAL HISTORY
Birth: at term by caesarean section due to non-progression of labour and unsatisfactory monitor -Apgar: 9/10- Weight RN: 2980 gr- Rest not relevant.

FAMILY HISTORY
Father admitted 15 days ago for suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (respiratory symptoms of cough and fever of 6 months of evolution). Chest X-ray and CT scan of the lungs and positive Mantoux test. He has been on anti-tuberculosis treatment for 10 days. Mantoux to family contacts pending reading. The rest of the patient was of no interest.

Tachypnoea and mild subcostal tugging. AP: acceptable bilateral ventilation with scattered inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. AC: rhythmic, systolic murmur 2/6 mesocardium. Abdomen: soft and depressible, palpation of the spleen pole at 1.5 cm below the costal margin and liver at 1 cm below the costal margin, not painful. ENT: abundant clear rhinorrhoea. Otoscopy normal. Neurological: Normal anterior fontanel, 2x 2 cm. Good spontaneous activity and reactivity to stimuli. Normal tone and strength. Follows the gaze and smiles during the examination. No skin lesions.

COMPLEMENTARY EXAMINATIONS
Haemogram: Hb 8.7, Ht 27%, leucocytes 21400 (38%N, 40%L), platelets 419000. Blood biochemistry: Glucose 100 mg/dl, ions, urea and creatinine normal. CRP 9 mg/dl-Chest X-ray A-P: bilateral interstitial infiltrate.

COMPLEMENTARY EXAMINATIONS (ON THE WARD)
Haemogram: leucocytes 18,500/mm3 (N 45%, L 41%, M 10%), Hb: 8.4 g/dl, Ht: 26%, MCV 78 fl, MCH 25 pg, ADE 15.7, reticulocytes 3%, platelets: 102000/mm3.
Smear: Anisocytosis with frequent echinocytes, some dianocytes and elliptocytes. White and platelet series without abnormalities.
Biochemistry: ions, renal, hepatic and lipid profiles normal except GGT 466 IU/l, TAG 208 mg/dl. Iron metabolism: iron 34 mcg/dl, IST 14%, Ferritin 879 ng/ml, transferrin 193 mg/dl.
Microbiology: Mantoux: 10 mm. Blood culture and urine culture: negative. CSF: nucleated cells 12/mm3; no red blood cells; glucose 57 mg/dL; protein 32 mg/dL. PCR for M. Tuberculosis negative in CSF.
Antigenic determination of RSV, influenza A and B negative.
PCR for B. Pertussis: negative.
PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in gastric juice negative (2 samples).
Imaging studies: Brain and abdominal ultrasound: normal
Chest X-ray PA (10 days after admission): fine nodular image homogeneously distributed in both lung fields compatible with TB with miliary dissemination.

EVOLUTION
Hospitalisation (2 weeks): On admission, the aforementioned complementary studies were performed and, given the suspicion of miliary tuberculosis, treatment was started with isoniazid with pyridoxine (10mg/kg/day), pyrazidamide (30/mg/kg/day) and rifampicin (15mg/kg/day), with a favourable evolution of fever and gradual improvement in respiratory symptoms.
Upon radiological confirmation of a pattern compatible with miliary tuberculosis, ethambutol (15mg/kg/day) and prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day) were added to the treatment. After completing respiratory isolation, and given the good clinical condition and excellent oral tolerance, discharge was decided, and treatment and follow-up continued on an outpatient basis.
It was confirmed that the antibiogram performed on the father according to RCP was sensitive to the antituberculosis drugs used. The mother is currently being treated with isoniazid B6 due to latent tuberculosis infection. There is no record of any other TB patients in the family.
Follow-up at discharge: Good tolerance to antituberculosis treatment, with favourable evolution.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
Miliary TB
