We present the case of a 51 year old male, who in 2001 was diagnosed with Common Variable Immunodeficiency; after various infectious complications, he started immunoglobulin replacement therapy in 2005. In the context of immunosuppression, he developed chronic disseminated granulomatous disease with gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, cutaneous and splenic involvement (giant splenomegaly requiring splenectomy).
Throughout the course of the disease, he developed uveitis of the right eye without a clear response to cyclosporine A, but with a partial response to high-dose prednisone, which has been chronically maintained (30 mg/day for the last 6 years).
At one of the check-ups, the patient presented with symptoms of general malaise, headache that increased with Valsalva manoeuvres, fever of up to 39oC and photophobia for two weeks. She was admitted for tests, with no significant findings; a cranial CT scan was performed, which showed no alterations except for the known chronic sinupathy.
After lumbar puncture, CSF showed increased cellularity (76 cells) with 74% mononuclear cells, hyperproteinorrachia, normal glucose and normal ADA. Microbiological examinations were normal (gram, aerobic culture, microscopy and multiplex PCR) except for positive India ink staining, positive Cryptococcus neoformans antigen detection and fungal culture growth of the same microorganism. The clinical diagnosis was subacute meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans, so the patient started antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine, until completing 5 weeks of treatment. After verifying clinical disappearance and normalisation of CSF biochemistry, together with microbiological negativisation of the CSF, oral fluconazole was started and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.
