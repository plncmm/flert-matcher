Anamnesis
A 58-year-old male patient with a history of dyslipidaemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, ischaemic stroke in March 2011, with ataxia and bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia as sequelae, diagnosed with neurosyphilis with meningovascular involvement, with positive serology in blood and CSF, starting treatment with intramuscular penicillin G benzathine. He abandoned the controls and it is not known whether he continued with the prescribed antibiotic treatment. The day before admission, he had a headache and speech impairment, which subsided within hours; the patient went to bed and, as he slept a lot, his wife tried to wake him up without success.

Physical examination
Blood pressure: 140/100 mmHg. Heart rate: 90 bpm. Afebrile. The patient was stuporous, no eye opening, no localised pain. No speech, no moaning. Pupils miotic, reactive to light. Skewed deviation of gaze in skew, divergent strabismus. Oculocephalic reflexes abolished, corneal reflex preserved. Facial grimace in pain. Motor system: flaccid tetraparesis, lower limbs withdrawn in pain. Osteotendinous reflexes abolished. No nuchal rigidity or meningeal signs.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests. Haemoglobin 14.6 g/dl, haematocrit 44.8%, MCV 83.6 fl, leukocytes 8,080/mm3 (71.3% N and 10.3% L), platelets 123,000/mm3. ESR normal. Biochemistry: no findings of interest. Liver and lipid profile without pathological findings. ACE normal. Total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus normal. Proteinogram: normal. Immunoglobulins and complement normal. CRP 29.2 mg/dl. Lytes serology: VDRL and FTA positive. HIV: negative.
- Lumbar puncture on admission: pressure of 20 cm H2O. Biochemistry: leukocytes 1/mm3, glucose 67 mg/dl, protein 0.49 g/l. VDRL: negative. FTA: positive. Toxoplasma IgG positive. Cultures negative. Positive oligoclonal bands.
- Chest X-ray: no significant findings.
- CT scan of the skull without contrast on admission: bital hypodensity in relation to infarction in the territory of Percheron's artery.
- Cranial CT angiography: no significant alterations.
- Echo-Doppler ultrasound of TSA: carotid atheromatosis, without significant stenosis.  Diagnosis Ischaemic stroke in the territory of the Percheron artery. Neurosyphilis with meningovascular involvement. Dyslipidaemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

Treatment
The patient received symptomatic and aetiological treatment with triflusal solution 600 mg, as well as high-dose penicillin parenterally.

Evolution
During admission, the patient remained haemodynamically stable, continued with a low level of consciousness, which improved progressively, alternating with periods of psychomotor agitation, which is why we do not have an MRI. Clinically at the time of diagnosis, the patient had moderate cognitive impairment, with ataxia and internuclear ophthalmoplegia persisting. Comparing the cerebrospinal fluid on admission with the diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid, cellularity and VDRL titres had disappeared.
