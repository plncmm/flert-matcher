A 14-month-old infant presented with recurrent eczematous lesions, nappy rash and frequent folliculitis, with no other infectious symptoms or alterations in the examination. The paternal aunt presented in childhood with recurrent skin and respiratory infections, bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis; and in adulthood, skin abscesses and pneumonia, with bronchiectasis and cystic lesions in several lung segments. The father reports numerous respiratory infections in childhood and adulthood with the presence of bronchiectasis. Given the possibility of hyperIgE syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance (ADH), a chest X-ray, blood count, biochemistry, thyroid hormones, immunoglobulins, complement, and lymphocyte subpopulations were performed, with no alterations found, and an adequate vaccine response. IgE was determined, rising from 411 kU/L (14 months) to 822 kU/L (23 months). A genetic study was requested, and a previously undescribed heterozygous mutation in the STAT3 gene was detected, which was also found in the father and paternal aunt. Varicella vaccine was administered and hydration and topical corticosteroids were prescribed for eczematous lesions, oral antihistamines to relieve pruritus, and antibiotics for superinfected lesions.

Our patient is a heterozygous carrier of a previously undescribed mutation in the STAT 3 gene, suggestive of pathogenic HyperIgE syndrome with ADH, given the patient's clinical and family history.
