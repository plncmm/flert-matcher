A 70-year-old man presented with fever of unknown origin and leg pain. He had metastatic rectal cancer and had started palliative QT 3 days earlier. A pelvic X-ray was performed and admission CK of 1600 mg/dl and CRP 20 mg/L were obtained, which was attributed to "post-QT rhabdomyolysis". After 12h, an extensive erythematous lesion appeared on the inner thigh, dysaesthesia and CK of 6000 mg/dl with CRP 40 mg/L, leukopenia, hypotension and fluctuations in consciousness. A cranial and pelvic CT scan + MMII was requested. The admission X-ray showed the presence of abundant gas apparently located between the muscle fibres of the iliac muscle and proximal musculature of the right leg. The CT scan without contrast (given his renal insufficiency) confirms the X-ray findings, showing the presence of gas between the muscle fibres and fasciae of the pelvic muscles and right thigh, inflammatory signs and oedema in the fat adjacent to the affected muscles. Findings in relation to fasciitis/necrotising myositis. The cranial study was normal. Staphylococcus hominis and Clostridium septicum appeared in the blood. 3 hours after the CT scan, debridement was performed and after 12 hours the patient died.
