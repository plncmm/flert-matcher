A 46-year-old woman with a tobacco consumption rate of 46 packs per year, alcoholic habit with consumption of 160 g of alcohol per day, periodontal disease with dental extraction the month before admission, with no other personal history of interest. Married with stable partner, mother of 4 children and housewife. She came to the emergency department for general malaise, non-thermometric dysthermic sensation with associated shivering, cough in the form of disneising attacks with foul-smelling rusty expectoration and pain in the right hemithorax, related to this cough. She denied having experienced vomiting or loss of consciousness in the context of alcohol overdose. In the previous days, she had visited her health centre on two occasions with similar symptoms, treated with mepifylline and then azithromycin for 6 days, which were partially effective in controlling her symptoms.

On examination, blood pressure was 106/70 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, O2 saturation by pulse oximetry 89% with FiO2 21% and a body temperature of 37.1oC. On inspection, regular general condition, conscious and alert, oriented in the three spheres, tachypneic when speaking. Leptosomic, earthy skin colouring and very poor personal hygiene with a septic, foul-smelling mouth. On respiratory auscultation, hypophonesis in the right upper and middle fields with isolated inspiratory crackles. Cardiac auscultation was unremarkable. At abdominal level, there was only non-painful hepatomegaly at the expense of the left hepatic lobe at 1 centimetre from the costal ridge. The lower extremities showed no oedema or signs suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.

Complementary tests performed in the ED showed a leukocytosis of 16160 cells/Î¼l with neutrophilia, haemoglobin of 11.8 g/dl with mean corpuscular volume of 102 fl, platelet count of 544000/mm3 and at the biochemical level a C-reactive protein of 135mg/L and procalcitonin of 0.02 ng/ml, with preserved renal function, with no other findings of interest. Sputum Gram stain, smear microscopy and determination of influenza A and B virus antigen were negative. Blood cultures and sputum cultures were taken. The chest X-ray showed cavitation in the upper lobe of the right lung with a hydro-aerial level suggestive of lung abscess, as well as an infiltrate with air bronchogram in the middle lobe (Chest X-ray: cavitation in the right upper lobe with hydro-aerial level). Given the clinical condition of the patient and the results of the complementary tests, it was decided to admit her to the Infectious Diseases unit of our hospital, with the presumptive diagnosis of right lung abscess.


Differential diagnosis
In general, the initial diagnosis of lung abscess is made by a chest X-ray showing a lung cavity with a hydro-aerial level as shown in our patient. In any cavitated lesion, a differential diagnosis should be made, which would mainly include the following entities:
- Bacterial infections: Usually due to anaerobic bacteria from the mouth.
- Septic pulmonary embolism: Septic embolisms can reach the lung from several sources, including:
- Infection of heart valves, usually resulting in multiple pulmonary, bilateral and peripheral abscesses, especially in cases of right-sided endocarditis. These are usually smaller than the one in our patient, which, together with the clinical presentation, makes this diagnosis unlikely.
- Peripheral septic thrombophlebitis. A classic mechanism for the development of lung abscesses, although in the current era infrequent, is the so-called Lemierre's syndrome, which occurs after an oropharyngeal infection and manifests as septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and septic metastases, whose most frequent aetiological agent is Fusobacterium necrophorum. In our patient, given the septic mouth and the previous history of dental extraction one month prior to admission, it was necessary to rule out this entity by means of a neck Doppler ultrasound, which was normal.
- Pulmonary abscesses secondary to catheter-related infection, which was ruled out in our case due to the absence of use of this material prior to the patient's condition.
- Pulmonary tuberculosis, which, although rare, may present in the form of abscess, and should always be a diagnosis to be taken into account due to its epidemiological, therapeutic and prognostic implications. In the case of suspicion, patients should be isolated until microbiological confirmation, as our patient was until we obtained 2 negative sputums without acid-fast bacilli.
- Lung neoplasia: Lung tumour masses can develop cavitation, even without secondary infection, although most commonly infection occurs behind a tumour-obstructed airway or within a large necrotic tumour mass. In these cases, clinical features, predisposing risk factors and computed tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosis.
- Pulmonary nodules in patients with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) and rheumatoid arthritis may form cavities and be mistaken for abscesses, but the systemic manifestations of these diseases are usually evident and allow a differential diagnosis to be made. Characteristically, bullae and blisters are thin-walled and have no surrounding infiltrates.
- Opportunistic pathogens such as fungi or parasites, Nocardia spp, hydatid cysts and other less likely causes were initially ruled out in our patient due to the characteristics of the case, the absence of immunosuppression and, subsequently, the results of the complementary tests and the evolution. Evolution A computed tomography of the chest with contrast was requested, which showed a pulmonary cavity with a hydro-aerial level in the right upper lobe at apical and posterior level of 10x7x7.5 cm compatible with abscess, with pericavitary infiltrate in the upper segment of the right lower lobe (LID) and anterior segment of the right upper lobe (LSD) in relation to pneumonic bronchogenic dissemination (Chest X-ray: lesion in the right upper lobe after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment).

Empirical intravenous treatment with imipenem and linezolid was started, de-escalating to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mg intravenous every 8 hours after 72 hours. The evolution was satisfactory both clinically and analytically, with a decrease in sputum quantity and fetidness as well as cough and fever. The results of the cultures taken in the ED were negative and 2 more smears (3 in total) were negative, as was the HIV serology. After 10 days of hospital treatment, it was decided to discharge him from hospital and continue with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mmHg every 8 hours at home, with follow-up in the outpatient department of the Infectious Diseases Unit. Treatment was completed after 6 weeks of antibiotherapy, and at the last examination she was found to be asymptomatic and with radiological improvement (CT chest c/c: cavitated lesion in LSD).

Final diagnosis
Primary lung abscess in the right upper lobe in a patient with periodontal disease and alcoholism.
