A 6-year-old girl presented with a 24-hour history of fever, weakness and vomiting.

Personal history: pneumonia at 4 years of age and admission to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for meningococcal meningitis at 5 years of age. Routine vaccinations up to date, plus pneumococcal vaccine (13-valent conjugate).

Physical examination revealed a fair general condition and nuchal rigidity. Lumbar puncture: neutrophilic pleocytosis and blood tests: characteristics of bacterial infection. He was admitted with intravenous cefotaxime. Meningitis due to Neisseira meningitidis (non-agglutinable serotype) was confirmed. Prophylaxis with rifampicin was administered to close contacts. Good evolution, being discharged on the eighth day of admission.

Results:
In view of recurrent meningococcal infection, an immunological study was performed, highlighting complement C5 deficiency. The genetic study detected a mutation in homozygosis (c.960_962del/p. Asn320del). Family study: one brother with homozygosis due to the same mutation with a history of meningitis and three brothers with heterozygosis with normal C5 values and no history of interest.

In view of congenital C5 deficiency, prophylactic treatment with benzathine penicillin and meningococcal vaccination (serogroup B) was instituted.
