A 49-year-old man with a personal history of hypercholesterolemia, gonorrhoea at the age of 19, cutaneous leishmaniasis (2007), osteopenia and vitamin D deficiency.
Diagnosed with HIV infection in 2005 (Stage A2). Initially received initial treatment with ATRIPLA. In 2013, due to hypophosphatemia, he was switched to Kivexa and Sustiva, which the patient took for 2 years, and in 2015, due to dizziness and poor control of triglycerides, he was switched to Triumeq. The last review after 3 months of treatment was well tolerated: no analytical alterations (GPT 23; GOT 22; GGT 18; FA 70; BT 0.70). His viral load was undetectable and his CD4 count was 940.
She attended the emergency department for 2 months of general malaise, night sweats, asthenia, myalgia and febrile fever. Examination revealed fever, mild mucocutaneous jaundice with no other noteworthy alterations.
The following complementary tests were performed:
- BQ: Glucose 89; Creatinine 0.90; Urea 34; Sodium 138.0; GOT 238; GPT 513; BT 2.26; BD 1.56; Amylase 56; Lipase 49. FA 840; LDH 386.
- Haemogram: haemoglobin 13, haematocrit 39.4; V.C.M. 89.7; platelets 293000; leukocytes 6,600 (neutrophils 4,100; lymphocytes 1,700; monocytes 500; eosinophils 100).
- Chest X-ray: Pulmonary parenchyma and pleura without findings of interest.
- ABDOMINAL ECOGRAPHY: No pathological findings of interest.
At this point we considered the diagnosis of acute hepatitis in an HIV patient with good immunological and virological control.
He was admitted for 24 hours for observation and among the tests requested the following were negative: blood culture, urine culture, CMV IgM; Brucella; Epstein Barr (past infection); Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus (vaccinated) and Hepatitis C virus.
In the study of TREPONEMA PALLIDUM: Total anti-Treponema Pallidum: POSITIVE. RPR: POSITIVE AT DILUTION 1/16.
When serology was positive for T. Pallidum (previous NOV/2011 NEGATIVE), treatment was started with: BENZETACIL IM weekly (3 doses).
After this, the clinical and analytical picture was resolved: GOT (AST): 29; GPT (ALT): 39; GGT 97; BT: 0.48; FA: 145, the final diagnosis being: Hepatitis secondary to Syphilis in an HIV patient with good immunological and virological control.
