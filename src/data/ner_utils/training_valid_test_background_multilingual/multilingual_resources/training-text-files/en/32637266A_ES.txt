A 67-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia was brought by her daughter to a psychiatric clinic because of behavioural changes. Her medication was lithium 600 mg per day, quetiapine 400 mg twice daily, insulin, empagliflozin, metformin, sitagliptin, atorvastatin, irbesartan and aspirin. On examination, she was poorly groomed, with no acute complaints. Her speech was slurred. She was disoriented with respect to time, space and people. Her vital signs were: respiratory rate 18 r.p.m., temperature 37.1 oC, pulse 100 l.p.m., blood pressure 145/82 mmHg and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 93% on room air. Lung examination revealed faint crackles.
Laboratory tests showed leukocyte count 7.78 x 103 cells per cubic millimetre (/mm3) with 9.4% lymphocytes, creatinine (Cr) high at 1.35 milligrams per decilitre (mg/dl) (reference 0.65 mg/dl) and lithium concentration 2.28 mmol/L. The electrocardiogram was normal. A cranial CT scan showed no relevant findings. A chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested by RT-PCR was positive.
She was admitted to the general ward for COVID-19 pneumonia, acute kidney injury and lithium intoxication. On the first day of admission, she received four litres of i.v. normal saline to treat the lithium intoxication and acute kidney injury. He had no acute worsening of COVID-19 symptoms from the i.v. fluids and had good diuresis. His mental status improved and lithium values normalised. He received hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 according to hospital protocol; however, his course was complicated by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure and he eventually died on day 4 of admission.
