Reason for consultation
A 27-year-old male patient attended primary care for odynophagia of 3 weeks' evolution, afebrile, with no other accompanying symptoms.
At the onset of the symptoms he consulted the emergency department and was discharged with a diagnosis of tonsillar aphthous ulcer and treatment with ibuprofen 600mg 1 tablet every 8h.
As the symptoms did not improve, he decided to come to our clinic for a new assessment.
