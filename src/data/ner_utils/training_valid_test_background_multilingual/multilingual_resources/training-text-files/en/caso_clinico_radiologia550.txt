Polytrauma patient aged 39 years due to a fall of 2 metres. No relevant medical history. Examination revealed hypertension, tachycardia and 95% saturation, with diffuse peritonitis and abdominal palpation. Laboratory tests showed a pattern of cytolysis, metabolic acidosis, hyperamylasaemia and anaemia.

Pancreatic laceration crossing more than 50% of the glandular thickness is associated with rupture of the main pancreatic duct, the more proximal to the head, the greater the likelihood. The presence of fluid between the splenic vein and the pancreas and peripancreatic fluid (serous or haematic) increases suspicion. Urgent laparotomy revealed rupture of the splenic capsule and complete section of the pancreatic body, with liponecrosis and inflammation of the peripancreatic fat and omentum. Corporo-caudal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The patient evolved with post-traumatic pancreatitis and organised collections, treated with drainage and antibiotherapy.
