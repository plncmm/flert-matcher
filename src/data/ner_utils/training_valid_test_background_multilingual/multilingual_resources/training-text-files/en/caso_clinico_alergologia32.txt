We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a history of anaphylaxis due to allergy to milk and lentils, atopic dermatitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma.

On the way to the outpatient clinic due to red eye symptoms, the patient ingested two cashew nuts and within a few minutes began to experience pharyngeal pruritus with abdominal pain, followed by generalised urticaria, eyelid oedema and bronchospasm on arrival at the outpatient clinic. At the outpatient clinic, 0.3mg of intramuscular adrenaline, salbutamol and antihistamines were administered, and he was transferred to our centre. A few minutes after arrival, the patient presented a sudden worsening with facial oedema and dyspnoea, and 0.6mg of intramuscular adrenaline, methylprednisolone and dexchlorpheniramine were administered. Despite treatment, severe hypotension (47/27 mmHg) and bradycardia were observed. After a new dose of 0.5mg of intravenous adrenaline due to haemodynamic instability, he was admitted to the paediatric ICU with intravenous adrenaline pump with progressive improvement. After a visit to the allergy clinic, the patient explained a previous episode of pharyngeal itching after eating cashew nut sauce.

The tryptase curve was 47/12.4/15 (baseline) ug/L. Acute total IgE was 242 KU/L with a specific IgE to pistachio of 0.92 KU/L. Skin tests for fruit, lipid transport proteins and nuts were negative, and pistachio and cashew nuts were not tested due to family refusal. ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 was requested and was negative against rAna o2 and an external determination of specific IgE to cashew nut complete extract of 3.09 KU/L with specific IgE to rAna o3 of 2.52 KU/L and total IgE of 239 KU/L. The basophil activation test against complete cashew extract was positive supporting the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock secondary to cashew storage proteins.
