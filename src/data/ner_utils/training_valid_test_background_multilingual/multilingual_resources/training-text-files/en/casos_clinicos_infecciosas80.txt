A 35-year-old port worker consulted for fever of up to 40oC for six days with general weakness, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, some diarrhoeal discharge, oliguria and jaundice. Personal history of tobacco and cannabis use and drinking (76 gr alcohol/day). He has not travelled abroad and has no contact with animals.

Physical examination on admission: Conscious and oriented. Ta 40oC, BP 140/70 mmHg. There was marked subconjunctival jaundice and bleeding in the oral mucosa. Cardiorespiratory auscultation: normal. Abdomen: painful on palpation with no signs of peritoneal irritation. No megaliths. The rest of the examination was normal.

Complementary tests:
- Blood count: haemoglobin 13.7 g/dl, leukocytes 15000/mm3 (88% PMN) and platelets 35000/mm3. Peripheral cytomorphology: neutrophilia with toxic granulation, discrete anisopoikilocytosis, without schistocytosis.
- Coagulation: prothrombin activity 70%, fibrinogen 7.5 g/l.
- Biochemistry: urea 151, mg/dl, creatinine 10 mg/dl, sodium 132 mEq/l, potassium 3.2 mEq/l, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 554 U/I, total bilirubin 17. 04 mg/dl (direct bilirubin 10.02 and indirect bilirubin 7.02 mg/dl), GOT 57 U/l, GPT 53 U/l, GGT 96 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 80 U/I, protein 6.1 g/dl, amylase 110 U/l, rest normal. CRP 79 mg/l. ESR 88 mm/h.
- Urine sediment: microhaematuria, positive nitrites, mild leucocyturia, high positive bilirubin.
- Venous blood gas: pH 7.38, pCO2 38mmHg, pO2 37 mmHg, BE -2.6.
- Chest X-ray and abdominopelvic ultrasound: no pathological findings.

Differential diagnosis
The initial differential diagnosis in a patient with fever and jaundice should include infectious causes: biliary tract (cholangitis and cholecystitis), acute viral hepatitis, liver abscesses and bacterial, fungal and parasitic liver infections. Another possibility is non-infectious hepatitis, such as alcoholic hepatitis and ischaemic hepatitis (vasculitis, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome). Abdominal ultrasound is unremarkable, showing a non-dilated bile duct, which excludes cholangitis, cholecystitis and liver abscesses. Transaminase elevation is mild (not more than ten times the normal value), which rules out acute viral hepatitis and ischaemic hepatitis. Although the patient consumes alcohol on a daily basis, there are no data suggesting excessive consumption (macrocytosis, spider veins, parotid hypertrophy, GOT/GPT<2, GGT slightly elevated). In this context of alcoholism, fever may be of non-infectious cause as in alcoholic hepatitis, acute pancreatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The slightly elevated amylase, the normal ultrasound and the mild elevation of transaminases without a clear predominance of GOT>GPT rule out these processes.
The patient had mixed hyperbilirubinaemia with no clear pattern: neither cholestasis (normal alkaline phosphatase) nor diffuse hepatocellular damage (transaminases were not disproportionately elevated with respect to alkaline phosphatase). The association of oliguric acute renal failure with a non-nephritic urinary sediment, with normal-sized kidneys and intact parenchyma according to ultrasound indicates a pre-renal or parenchymal condition. In this context, another diagnostic possibility is haemolytic uraemic syndrome, as it presents renal failure and thrombopenia but no haemolytic anaemia or schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear, nor would it explain the liver involvement. Another diagnostic possibility is catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome due to multiple organ involvement and development of clinical manifestations within a week, but this is a condition that occurs more frequently in women (72%) in the context of primary antiphospholipid syndrome or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus.

Fungal liver infections are unlikely because the patient is neither immunocompromised nor neutropenic. Not having travelled abroad makes infection by liver flukes such as Clonorchiasis, Fasciola hepatica and Opisthorchiasis unlikely.

The findings of hepatic and renal failure, thrombopenia, fever and haemorrhage suggest an infectious condition with systemic repercussions.  Acute renal failure with normal potassium levels, elevated creatine phosphokinase muscle isoenzyme (in the absence of trauma, physical exercise or recent intramuscular injection) and the presence of haemorrhages together with a specific epidemiological environment (dock worker) suggest a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Not having travelled abroad excludes other infectious diseases such as Hantavirus, Dengue and Malaria which share similar symptoms and endemic patterns with leptospirosis. Another disease to be considered in the differential diagnosis is rickettsiosis which can mimic leptospirosis.

Evolution
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for the first 48 hours, and progressed favourably with diuretics, empirical antibiotic therapy and platelet transfusion.
Blood, urine and stool cultures were negative. Serology for cytomegalovirus, herpes, toxoplasma, varicella, Epstein-Barr virus, rickettsiae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Coxiella burnetti, HIV, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:9 were negative or past infection. Hepatitis virus: HAV IgM negative, HbsAg negative, Anti Hbc negative and Anti HCV negative. He progressed favourably on the ward with broad-spectrum antibiotherapy (meropenin, metronidazole and doxycycline) with normalisation of renal function and platelet counts, with bilirubin and transaminases in progressive decline. At discharge the patient was asymptomatic and home treatment with doxycycline was maintained. A sample was sent to the reference centre for leptospirosis with a positive IgM result.

Final diagnosis
Icteroazoemic leptospirosis or Weil's disease.
