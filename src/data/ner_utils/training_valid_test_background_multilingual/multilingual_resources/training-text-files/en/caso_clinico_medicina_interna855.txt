History
A 60-year-old woman with ethanolic liver cirrhosis (Child B) and pancytopenia. She lives in a rural area.

History and examination
She consulted the ED for fever, vomiting and dysarthria; she was admitted to the Digestive Department as hepatic encephalopathy. During admission, despite optimising treatment, neurological symptoms and fever persisted, so Infectious Diseases was consulted. On rehistorising the patient, she commented that three days before admission, she had started with holocranial headache, vomiting and dizziness with gait instability. On examination: afebrile, BP 94/54 mmHg, 69 bpm, 100% saturation. Conscious, oriented, pan-focal systolic murmur, normal pulmonary auscultation, soft, painless abdomen, chronic venous insufficiency, gait instability, Romberg not assessable, negative meningeal signs and normal rest.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests showed leucopenia (2360/l) with lymphopenia (100/l), anaemia (9.8 mg/dl) and thrombopenia (32000/L). A systematic urine analysis, chest X-ray, abdomen, cranial CT scan and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Urine culture was negative. Nasopharyngeal exudate was negative. HIV serology was negative. Lumbar puncture was performed with CSF with high opening pressure (260 mmH2O), 55 cells/Ul with lymphocyte predominance, 49.9 mg/dl protein and 11 mg/dl glucose. Both blood and CSF cultures isolated cryptococcus neoformans, with a positive antigen titre of 1/8192 and 1/16784 respectively. Additionally, MRI showed hyperintensity of the lobes and cerebellum, and echocardiography ruled out endocarditis.

Diagnosis. Evolution
Diagnosed with Cryptoccocus neoformans meningoencephalitis with cryptocococcaemia, treatment was started with liposomal amphotericin B (300 mg) and fluconazole (800 mg). The patient responded adequately to treatment.
