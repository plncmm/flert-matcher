A 75-year-old man presented with fever, chills and productive cough on 19 March 2020. His cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension, obesity, ex-smoking and renal failure. A test for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2 was positive, and home quarantine was advised; however, worsening dyspnoea required hospitalisation.
In addition to cough, fever (38.7°C) and low oxygen saturation (88% without oxygen), laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (82 mg/m), myoglobin (636 mg/l), troponin T (ultrasensitive, 80 ng/l) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (833 ng/l).
Electrocardiogram revealed left anterior fascicular block and T-wave inversion in lead aVL.
Tests for other viruses (adenovirus; Coronaviridae 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43; human bocavirus; metaneumovirus; rhinovirus/enterovirus; parainfluenza 1-4) were negative. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2 was reconfirmed in the laboratory. As troponin was increasing (191 ng/l), coronary angiography was performed on 23 March 2020, which ruled out epicardial stenosis, but left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic filling pressure was high at 14 mmHg.
An echocardiogram performed on the same day revealed normal LV and RV activity, with signs of concentric LV remodelling and no wall motion abnormalities. On 24 March 2020, a cardiac MRI was performed to evaluate possible inflammatory myocardial injury. Because of dyspnoea, the cardiac MRI (Philips 1.5 Tesla) was performed in free breathing using mainly single-take sequences. Normal LV and RV activity was observed, with no regional wall motion abnormalities. No focal fibrosis was detected with late gadolinium enhancement sequences. T2-weighted images showed global oedema as well as elevated T2 (56 ms, reference 48 § 3 ms) and T1 (1090 ms, reference 989 § 28 ms) values, suggesting acute myocardial injury. On 26 March 2020, an episode of hypoxaemic respiratory failure (saturation 80%) required mechanical ventilation.
The patient improved and was extubated; cardiac biomarker values decreased (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide 631 ng/l, troponin 61 ng/l) progressively.
