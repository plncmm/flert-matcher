AMO, 46 years old, male, from the municipality of Anam√£ (AM). In October 2007, he presented with fever and palpitations and was diagnosed with RCT by thick blood test positive for T. cruzi. The epidemiological history did not allow for suspicion of the mode of transmission of CD. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm with an average ventricular rate of 110 bpm. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Aetiological treatment for Chagas disease was started with benzonidazole. With regard to AF, heart rate control was started with beta-blockers, anticoagulation and a transesophageal echocardiogram was scheduled for subsequent cardioversion. After approximately two weeks of aetiological treatment for CAD, there was reversion to sinus rhythm, without the need for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.
