A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension and multiple sclerosis attended the emergency department on 14 March with symptoms of fever, vomiting and dyspnoea of 4 days' evolution. He was hypoxaemic, with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air and febrile at 38.5°C. A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities, more severe in the right lung. A flu test was negative. A nasopharyngeal swab sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing by PCR was positive. On 15 March (symptomatology day 5), the patient's hypoxaemia worsened and he was transferred to the ICU, where he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The C-reactive protein value was 338 mg/dL and lactate dehydrogenase was 714 U/L. He met the criteria for severe ARDS, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 73. He was treated with a daily prone positioning protocol. He developed acute kidney injury, which required CRRT on 17 March. A review of the medical history revealed no history of chronic kidney disease. Because of the clogged dialysis circuit, the patient was treated with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin. The medication was azithromycin (500 mg i.v. daily), ceftriaxone (1 g i.v. daily), hydroxychloroquine (initial dose 800 mg, then 400 mg i.v. daily) and dexamethasone (20 mg i.v. daily). Despite attempts to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation, he was unable to breathe on his own and remained on ventilation during his ICU stay. On 30 March, the patient developed shock resistant to vasopressor therapy and died on 26 March.
