A 90-year-old woman attended the emergency department for dysphagia but reported abdominal pain for several days, with deterioration of renal function in the blood tests. A simple abdominal X-ray showed gas surrounding the bladder suggestive of emphysematous cystitis. It was decided to perform an abdominopelvic CT scan without VSD, which confirmed intramural gas in the bladder, in the perivesical space and extending cranially, dissecting the anterior abdominal wall. Emphysematous cystitis with extraperitoneal bladder perforation versus associated necrotising fasciitis is suggested. A urine culture showed E. coli. After a month, a check-up was carried out, following intravenous antibiotic and oral treatment, with practical resolution of the emphysema.
