A 74-year-old man, with no personal history of interest, was referred to the emergency department for a suspected severe allergic reaction. The patient started two hours after ingestion of fish, with pruritus and oedema in both hands, followed by facial oedema and nausea.
After being seen at a primary care centre where IM adrenaline, corticosteroids, antihistamines and bronchodilators were administered, on arrival at the emergency department the physical examination showed no alterations, except for generalised erythema predominantly facial and scattered expiratory wheezing, without uvula oedema.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytes 21.4x109/L (neutrophils 18.9), lactic acid 4.7mmol/L, venous blood pCO2 38, venous blood bicarbonate 20, procalcitonin 4.2ng/ml (decreasing to 0.6ng/ml three days later).
Given the suspicion of an allergic reaction due to anisakiasis, IgE antibodies against Anisakis (28.70kU/L) and gastroscopy where parasitic structures compatible with Anisakis were observed, confirming the diagnosis.
