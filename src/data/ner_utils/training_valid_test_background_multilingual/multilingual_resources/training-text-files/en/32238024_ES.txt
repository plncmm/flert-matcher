The patient was a 35-year-old woman with no personal history. On 21 January 2020, she travelled to Japan from Wuhan (China). She was healthy until 30 January, when she developed fever and mild diarrhoea. On 31 January, at the primary care clinic, she underwent a rapid influenza antigen test and was found to be negative. A chest CT scan revealed signs of pneumonia in the lower left lung and she was transferred to the Japanese Red Cross Hospital in Narita. She reported no sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chills or cough. She had not been to the Huanan market and had not been exposed to wild or dead animals. On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure 106/66 mmHG, pulse 93 bpm, temperature 37.9Â°C, respiratory rate 16 bpm and room air oxygen saturation 97%. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed no leukocytosis, leukocytopenia or high liver enzyme values. A chest CT scan showed slight ground-glass opacities in the lower lobe of the left lung. He was transferred to a negative pressure isolation room. He was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin after obtaining a pharyngeal swab. PCR testing of the pharyngeal swab for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. He continued to have fever but no respiratory symptoms such as cough. On hospital day 5, provoked sputum and a second pharyngeal swab were obtained. The sputum PCR test was positive, but the pharyngeal smear remained negative. His condition was stable and fever and diarrhoea improved on hospital day 6. On hospital day 12, the patient had fully recovered and sputum PCR and pharyngeal smear tests were negative. During the entire clinical course, no positive PCR tests were ever obtained from pharyngeal smears. All PCR tests were performed in the reference laboratory by real-time RT-PCR assays following a protocol already described.
