A 5-year-old boy, with no relevant history, presented with fever, cough and abdominal pain of several days' evolution. His condition worsened to cardiogenic shock and he was transferred to our institution, where he tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies and had high IL-6 values. He developed pulmonary failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). After 5 days of ECMO, right arreactive mydriasis was noted. His heparin was urgently cancelled and the cannula removed; an urgent cranial CT scan revealed right middle cerebral artery infarction, cerebral oedema and diffuse contralateral subarachnoid haemorrhage. Following the CT scan, he also presented with left arreactive mydriasis. Reversal of his paralysis revealed absence of movement and brainstem reflexes. Brain death was confirmed 3 days later, after normalisation of his electrolytes.
