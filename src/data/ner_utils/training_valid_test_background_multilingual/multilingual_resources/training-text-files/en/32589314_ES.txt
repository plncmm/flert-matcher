Symptoms associated with COVID-19 pneumonia appeared 10 days before the rash. The patient had no history of similar rashes. She also had no history of herpes infection. Complete blood count, biochemical parameters and serological tests for herpes simplex virus IgM and IgG, Epstein-Barr virus IgM and IgG, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG, and HCV and Mycoplasma IgM and IgG were within normal limits.
