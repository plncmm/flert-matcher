Anamnesis
A 24-year-old man with a history of intestinal polyposis, angioma of the left forearm and right buttock. He came to the Emergency Department for haematuria of one month's evolution with multiple previous consultations, associated with worsening general condition, fever of 38oC of 12 hours of evolution, chills, sweating, pain in the left renal fossa and flank, decreased diuresis.

Physical examination
Physical examination on admission: blood pressure 154/99 mmHg, heart rate 109 bpm, temperature 37.7 oC. Abdomen painful on palpation in the left flank and positive ipsilateral renal fist percussion; on auscultation there was a perceptible abdominal murmur. Macroscopic haematuria is evidenced by bladder catheterisation.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis of 15,100 thousand/mm3, platelets 136,000 thousand/mm3, urinary sediment with >100 red blood cells and leukocytes per field. Other findings were unchanged.
- Abdominal ultrasound: large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left kidney with secondary aneurysmal dilatation of 9.5 cm. Left kidney of normal size, echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation somewhat increased.
- Computed tomography angiography: formation in the left kidney, vascular in appearance, with large vessels and an aneurysmal formation in its lower pole measuring 92 x 95 mm, compatible with AVM. Four arterial vessels from the aorta supplying the malformation and the left kidney were observed. The aneurysmal formation communicates through the left renal vein with the vena cava, which has an increased calibre. The right kidney is unaltered.
- The study is complemented from the cardiological point of view to determine the repercussions of the renal lesion on the patient's haemodynamic state.
- Transthoracic ultrasound: slight dilatation of the four cardiac chambers with normal thicknesses, compatible with volumetric overload. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction, normal valves. Cava plethora (severe dilatation of 38 mm without respiratory collapse) in relation to hyperflow.
- Cardiac MRI: cardiomegaly at the expense of right chambers with signs of ipsilateral overload. Dilatation of the pulmonary artery trunk, hypertrabeculation of both ventricles predominantly of the LV with decreased systolic function.

Diagnosis
A diagnosis of AVM of the left kidney was established, with arterial hypertension and haematuria, complicated by acute left pyelonephritis.

Treatment
Once the diagnosis was established, antibiotic treatment of the infectious condition was started. Subsequently, the case was assessed by Interventional Radiology, who ruled out intervention due to the morphological characteristics of the lesion and the technical impossibility, proceeding to embolisation of the subsidiary left renal arteries by means of percutaneous access with Amplatzer devices and lower pedicle of the malformation with coils by Vascular Surgery, Embolisation of the third branch was not possible because it had a very small neck from the aortic wall, and the control CT scan showed contrast filling of the lesion similar to previous studies.
In view of the results, it was decided to carry out a joint intervention between Vascular Surgery and Urology. An en bloc left nephrectomy was performed with the AVM and aneurysm.

Evolution
He presented a favourable postoperative evolution, being discharged a few days later, with subsequent revisions that showed that the patient was in good general condition and had experienced an improvement in his cardiological parameters; he was assessed by the Genetics Service, who carried out a study to determine the aetiology of the vascular lesion.
He is currently asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable, being followed up by Internal Medicine for multinodular goitre and by the Digestive System for colonic polyposis.
