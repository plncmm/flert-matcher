A 30-year-old woman, with no remarkable past history, presented with nocturnal parosmia (with intense odour of sweaty feet) for several hours. The next day she felt a little unwell. She had no specific symptoms (cough, fever). Two days later she reported total loss of smell and taste. An otorhinolaryngologist diagnosed complete anosmia. Topical steroid treatment was started twice daily. Post-viral hyposmia was diagnosed but, in the absence of known symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered. Anosmia started to improve 6 days later until it disappeared completely. A cranial MRI showed no abnormalities. Fourteen days after the parosmia, it was published that hyposmia may be a symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One day later, a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive.
