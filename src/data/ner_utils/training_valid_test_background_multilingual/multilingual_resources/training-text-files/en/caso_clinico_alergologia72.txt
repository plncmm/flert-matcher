An 11-year-old girl who, after eating yoghurt with almonds and peanuts, presented with dyspnoea, dysphagia, rhinoconjunctivitis, urticaria and labial angioedema. She was treated with adrenaline and remained asymptomatic. After 8 hours, the clinical symptoms reappeared, so adrenaline was administered and she was admitted, repeating 2-3 episodes per day, requiring a total of 5 doses of adrenaline over 4 days. Study with negative results for tryptase, skin tests and food-specific IgE, and quantitative and functional C1 inhibitor. Tolerance to milk, walnuts, pistachios and sunflower seeds was demonstrated; oral exposure test to other nuts is pending.
An 8-year-old boy who, after taking amoxicillin and ibuprofen for tooth extraction, presented with lip oedema and generalised urticaria, treated with dexchlorferinamine and prednisone. After 12 hours the symptoms persisted with the addition of abdominal pain and vomiting, which resolved with adrenaline. After 4 hours the symptoms reappeared and he was admitted, requiring 13 doses of adrenaline for 4 days. Between episodes the patient had a mild urticarial rash. Laboratory tests (serial tryptase, complement, quantitative and functional C1 inhibitor, eosinophil cationic protein, serology, Phadiatop, and penicillin- and amoxicillin-specific Ig E) were negative. The patient did not attend subsequent follow-ups and no skin or exposure tests were performed.
