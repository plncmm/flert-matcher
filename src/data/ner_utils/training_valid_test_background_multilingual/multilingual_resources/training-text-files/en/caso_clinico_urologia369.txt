A 24-year-old man, with no past history of interest, consulted in the emergency department for fever and a single painful lesion on the scrotum, of 12 hours' evolution. The patient reported a fever of up to 38oC of one week's evolution, labelled as pharyngotonsillitis, and treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. There was no history of trauma, exposure to animals, sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis. Examination revealed a flat, erythematous, circumscribed lesion with a necrotic border on the left hemiscrotal area that was painful on palpation. After 24 hours of evolution, there was evidence of an increase in the diameter of the lesion with a necrotic centre and erythematous borders.
Both testicles were normal on examination. There were no inguinal lymphadenopathies, leukocytosis (14000/ml) and increased glomerular sedimentation rate. Urine sediment and urine culture were normal.
Testicular ultrasound ruled out testicular involvement, except for oedema of the testicular lining. Chest and abdominal X-rays showed no abnormalities.
During his admission, serology was carried out for LÃºes, V.I.H.1 and V.I.H.2, rickettsiae, as well as determination of antinuclear antibodies, urine culture and culture of urethral exudate, all of which were negative.
Treatment was started with third generation cephalosporin and NSAIDs for pain control. A histological study was not considered due to the good clinical evolution of the patient with the treatment given, and with disappearance of the lesion after 20 days.
