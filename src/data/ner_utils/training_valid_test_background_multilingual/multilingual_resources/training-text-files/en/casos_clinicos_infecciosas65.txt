Patient aged 77 years. Renal transplant from cadaveric donor in 2014. Usual immunosuppression: Meprednisone + Mycophenolate + Sirolimus. Usual creatinine: 1.8 mg/dl. He was hospitalised for COVID-19 pneumonia. Immunosuppression was suspended and he remained on hydrocortisone. He started treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir + hydroxychloroquine which was suspended due to QTc prolongation. On the fourth day of hospitalisation, he developed septic shock and AKIN 3 acute kidney injury. Urine sedimentation was performed: dark, granular casts 3/cpo + scanty isomorphic red blood cells. Urinary sediment was interpreted as being attributable to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal replacement therapy was indicated. He progresses with anuria and positive PCR for COVID at day +21.
