Anamnesis
A 76-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, who came to the Urology Department with a clinical picture of 6 months' evolution, characterised by a nodule on the shaft of the penis.

Physical examination
On palpation, there was a 1 cm nodule surrounding a large part of the corpora cavernosa. On rectal examination, the prostate was palpated with a stony right lobe and an indurated left lobe. Locoregional adenopathies were not palpable.
Complementary tests
- Haemogram: leucocytosis of 12.81 mil/mm3 with relative lymphocytosis of 31.2%.
- Blood biochemistry: glucose 147 mg/dl, creatinine 1.38 mg/dl.
- Blood and urine sediment: leucocytes 20-30/field. Moderate bacteriuria.

- Urine culture: > 100,000 CFU/ml of Citrobacter koseri.
- B-HCG < 1.2 IUU/ml.
- Carcinoembryonic antigen 1.29 ng/ml.
- Alpha-fetoprotein 3.41 ng/ml.
- Prostate specific antigen (PSA): 26.48 ng/ml.
- CA 19.9 11.95 IU/ml.
- CA 15.3 7.5 U/ml.
- Penile ultrasound: in the right corpus cavernosum there is a nodule of 1 cm in diameter, hypoechogenic. At the base of the penis there is another nodule, located between the corpus spongiosum and the left corpus cavernosum, measuring 2 cm, bilobed and hypoechogenic. Both lesions are highly vascularised.
- Thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT): alterations at the level of the pulmonary parenchyma, in relation to images of bullae and nodule of undetermined characteristics in the left lung. Enlarged prostate (5 cm), with calcifications inside.
- Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): two nodules of 2 and 3 cm maximum axis were identified on the posterior aspect of the penis, infiltrating the corpora cavernosa, mainly the left one and the corpus spongiosum, with a slightly elevated signal intensity in all sequences with respect to the signal of the corpora cavernosa, with intense enhancement from the initial phases of the dynamic study. In the prostate gland, on the right side of the peripheral region, at the level of the base and the middle zone, a mass is identified that causes signal alteration, extending to the prostatic capsule in that location, also affecting the seminal vesicle on the same side.

Diagnosis
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate with synchronous penile metastases.

Treatment
Treatment was started with bicalutamide in combination with leuprorelin acetate.

Evolution
A biopsy of the penile nodule was performed. The anatomopathological study reported a biopsy of the corpus cavernosum with carcinoma infiltration. The immunohistochemical study showed that the neoplasm was positive for vimentin, CD10, Cam-5.2 and racemase; it was negative for cytokeratins (CK7, CK20 and CK5/6), uroplakin, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD117, PSA and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). The lesion suggests renal origin due to the finding of clear cells (vimentin and CD 10 +); in addition, urothelial and prostatic tumours with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia should be ruled out due to the racemase + marker. The CT scan showed no lesions suggestive of a primary tumour in the kidney. Transurethral resection of the bladder was performed, as well as ureteral cytology and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. During the intraoperative period, stiffness in the penile urethra was observed in relation to metastasis and some priapism. He progressed slowly but favourably in the postoperative period, with haematuria that subsided with the usual conservative measures. Treatment with hormone blockade (bicalutamide) was started during her stay. The pathological anatomy report showed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason score 8 (3 + 5). The bladder catheter was removed, and he was discharged in good general condition, after spontaneous urination of non-hematuric urine. Subsequently, treatment was started with leuprorelin acetate. He currently has a decrease in prostate-specific antigen, which is 1.17 ng/ml, and the previous level of 26.48 ng/ml.
