We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with a family history of a beekeeper father with hypersensitivity to Apis mellifera venom. In the summer of 2016, following a bee sting on his hand, he reported immediate bilateral eyelid oedema, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, conjunctival injection and dyspnoea, requiring emergency care and treatment with Urbason® and Polaramine® with slow improvement of symptoms.

He had previously received several bee and wasp stings, presenting only a local reaction.

Complementary examinations: Blood tests and skin tests were performed.

Results:
Blood tests: Normal haemogram. Tryptase 4 ug/L. Total IgE 14.0 U/mL. Specific IgE: bee venom (Apis mellifera) 1.88 kU/L, rApi m1 (phospholipase A2) 1.25 kU/L, rApi m10 0.3 kU/L, wasp venom (Vespula spp.) <0.1 kU/L, wasp venom (Polistes spp.) <0.1 kU/L, bumblebee venom (Vespa cabro) <0.1 kU/L.
Bee venom skin tests: pricktest 1mcg/ml negative, intradermal reaction at 0.001 mcg/ml positive 10mm.

Conclusions:
We present a case of grade II anaphylaxis due to sensitisation to bee venom, in a child at risk due to the parental profession and the rural environment to which he belongs, with a high degree of re-exposure to bee stings, which implies an increase in the prevalence of systemic allergic reactions of 14 - 32%, compared to 1 - 4% in the general population.
