Anamnesis
65-year-old male with the following history: chronic enolism, sigmoidectomy with discharge colostomy for left incarcerated inguinal hernia and chronic renal insufficiency. Low socioeconomic level, with poor hygienic and sanitary conditions. Nephrourological history: 6 months prior to current admission, admitted for fungal urinary infection and acute renal failure with bilateral grade III ureterohydronephrosis, BPH and large bladder lithiasis, without being able to establish the presence of a bladder balloon on admission. After urethral catheterisation, there was no significant improvement in renal function, and upper urinary tract ect ectasia persisted, so it was decided to perform a bilateral nephrostomy, after which renal function improved to baseline levels of around 2.5 mg/dl of creatinine. During the same admission, a transvesical prostatic adenomectomy and cystolithotomy were performed. The postoperative period was characterised by infection of the surgical wound by Enteroccocus faecalis, which required antibiotic treatment and a vacuum device (VAC) for closure. After 2 months of hospitalisation, the patient was discharged after closure and removal of both nephrostomies and removal of the bladder catheter, with stable renal function at around 2.5 mg/dl of creatinine.
The patient consulted the hospital's Emergency Department for a history of fever, asthenia, anorexia, haematuria, oliguria and lower urinary tract symptoms of several days' duration.

Physical examination
On arrival at the Emergency Department he was in poor general condition, conscious and oriented, with cold skin, lividity in the lower limbs and no neurological focality. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed tachycardia, without murmurs or friction rubs and with preserved vesicular murmur. Blood pressure 108/80 mmHg, heart rate 100 bpm, temperature 36.5 oC. Abdomen soft, non-painful, no signs of peritoneal irritation, no evidence of visceromegaly or masses. Fist percussion and bilateral renal bimanual palpation were negative.

Complementary tests
An abdominal X-ray, blood and urine tests, urine cultures and abdominal ultrasound were requested in the emergency department:
- Blood analysis: urea 354 mg/dl, creatinine 8.3 mg/dl, sodium 130 mEq/l, potassium 7.1 mEq/l, 13,500 leukocytes/mm3, 472,000 platelets/mm3, haemoglobin 15.2 g/dl. Venous blood gases: pH 6.9, bicarbonate 7.7 mmol/l, ABE -25 mmol/l.
- Urine sediment: pH 9, leucocyturia and haematuria. Urine Gram-positive bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were observed.
- Abdominal X-ray: nondescript.
- Abdominal ultrasound: bilateral hydronephrosis was identified, with linear calcification along the entire urothelium of both renal pelvises, as well as in scattered calcific clusters in both kidneys. The right ureter shows urothelial thickening and wall calcification similar to the rest of the urothelium. Bladder with thickened walls, scarcely repleted and with a catheter inside. Previous ultrasound studies without such calcifications.
During admission:
- Urine culture: Staphylococcus capitis subspecies urealitycum and Gram-positive bacilli of the Corynebacterium type.
- CT scan without contrast: linear calcification, polygonal in shape, in both renal sinuses. Characteristic findings of encrusting pyelitis. Bilateral hydronephrosis.

Diagnosis
Encrusting pyelitis.

Treatment and evolution
An urgent haemodialysis session was performed due to the deterioration of the patient's water-electrolyte and renal function, subsequently requiring infusion of vasoactive drugs due to sustained hypotension, which were withdrawn in the following days, after normalisation of the haemodynamic constants.
Given the initial ultrasound findings and their comparative discordance with the imaging tests from the previous admission (no alterations), it was decided to perform an abdominal CT scan without contrast, which gave the presumptive diagnosis of encrusting pyeloureteritis, which was subsequently confirmed with the analytical (urinary pH 9) and microbiological (positive urine culture for Corynebacterium urealyticum) findings.
Empirical antibiotic therapy was initially established and subsequently modified according to the antibiogram (treatment with vancomycin was started). Initially, the patient evolved satisfactorily, with improvement in renal function levels, hydroelectrolyte correction and withdrawal of vasoactive drugs due to stable haemodynamic constants. Subsequently, he developed an abrupt onset of febrile fever, respiratory distress and haemodynamic instability, and died a few hours later, 2 weeks after admission to hospital.
