Clinical history. Anamnesis
Male, 73 years old, included in the complex chronic programme for meeting categories C; COPD; D, chronic liver disease, and G; chronic anaemia.
He was admitted after falling down stairs, and started with dyspnoea + cough, with a torpid evolution and progressive respiratory worsening with radiological image of bilateral bronchopneumonia and severe respiratory failure. Preliminary microbiology results showed hyphae, so Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole + voriconazole were started. Admitted to ICU due to poor evolution.

Physical examination
The most notable findings were psychomotor agitation, global hypoventilation with rhonchi and bilateral crackles, associated with the presence of ascites and oedema.
He had multiple scalp-like lesions with skin tearing in the upper extremities and anterior tibial areas.

Complementary tests
CRP of 14.34. Leukocytosis of 22,500 with 96.3% neutrophils. Arterial blood gases; pH: 6.94, PO2: 56 mmHg, PCO2: 83 mmHg, HCO3: 17.8 mmol/l. Chest X-ray; bilateral bronchopneumonia.

Evolution
Intubation was required due to severe respiratory failure, with haemodynamic deterioration and oligoanuria, requiring vasoactive support and haemofiltration. Multi-organ failure occurred, leading to exitus a few days later. Bronchoalveolar lavage isolated abundant growth of Fusarium spp, among others.
