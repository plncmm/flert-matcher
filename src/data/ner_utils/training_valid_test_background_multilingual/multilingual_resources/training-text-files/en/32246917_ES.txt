On 23 January 2020, a 61-year-old woman presented with acute asthenia in both legs and severe fatigue, with a one-day evolution. She had returned from Wuhan on 19 January but reported no fever, cough, chest pain or diarrhoea. His temperature was 36.5°C, oxygen saturation was 99% on room air and respiratory rate was 16 bpm. Pulmonary auscultation revealed no abnormalities. Neurological examination showed symmetrical asthenia (Medical Research Council grade 4/5) and areflexia in both legs and feet. Three days after admission, his symptoms worsened. Muscle strength was grade 4/5 in both arms and hands and 3/5 in both legs and feet. Sensitivity to touch and pinprick decreased distally. 
Laboratory tests on admission were clinically significant for lymphocytopenia (0.52 × 109/L; normal range: 1.1-3.2 × 109/L) and thrombocytopenia (113 × 109/L; normal range: 125-300 × 109/L). CSF tests gave normal cell counts (5 x 106/L; normal range: 0-8 × 106/L) and high protein values (124 mg/dL; normal range: 8-43 mg/dL). Nerve conduction tests (day 5) revealed delayed distal latencies and absent early F waves, manifestations consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Guillain-Barré syndrome was diagnosed and immunoglobulin was administered i.v. On day 8 (30 January), the patient presented with dry cough and fever of 38.2 °C. Chest CT showed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. The patient was immediately transferred to an infectious disease ward and given symptomatic treatment and the antiviral drugs arbidol, lopinavir and ritonavir. Her clinical condition gradually improved and her lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts normalised on day 20. She was discharged on day 30, with normal muscle strength and recovery of reflexes in both arms and legs. Her respiratory symptoms also subsided. Oropharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.
