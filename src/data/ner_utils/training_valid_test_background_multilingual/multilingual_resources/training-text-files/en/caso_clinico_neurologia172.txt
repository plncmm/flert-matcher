Anamnesis
A 36-year-old woman, with no past history of interest, consulted for headache and blurred vision. In the 3 weeks prior to admission she presented a febrile syndrome with temperatures up to 38 oC, and 5 days before admission she had a predominantly frontal headache and bilateral blurred vision with retroocular pain.

Physical examination
Fever of 37.5 oC. Visual acuity was 0.2 in both eyes and bilateral papillary oedema. The rest of the neurological and systemic examination was normal. Blurring of the papillary borders and bilateral papillary elevation. Several small yellowish nodular lesions were visualised in the nasal retina.

Complementary tests
- CBC: normal. ESR 22 mm, CRP normal. Beta-2-microglobulin 2.81.
- Autoimmunity (ANA and ACA) negative.
- Ocular angiofluorescein: compatible with bilateral optic neuritis.
- Brain MRI: small frontal lesion compatible with meningioma as the only finding.
- Lumbar puncture on admission: normal opening pressure, glucose 45 (simultaneous blood 110). Hyperproteinorraquia of 126, 70 cells predominantly mononuclear (97%), red blood cells 3,600, ADA 7.9. BOC negative. Similar serial lumbar punctures, compatible with lymphocytic meningitis.
- Lumbar puncture (after tuberculostatic treatment): glucose 53 (simultaneous 114), 66 proteins, leukocytes 7, red blood cells 6.
- Serology in serum and CSF for Borrelia, Brucella, lupus, HIV, Bartonella, herpes, cryptococcus antigen: negative.
- Mantoux, mycobacterial culture, PCR for tuberculosis negative.
- Chest X-ray: no notable alterations.
- ECG: normal sinus rhythm.
- Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: small non-specific mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a single abdominal lymphadenopathy near the celiac trunk, without suggesting any abnormality.

Diagnosis
Initial diagnosis: meningitis and tuberculous optic neuritis as first possibility.
Definitive diagnosis: sarcoidosis.

Treatment
Initially, treatment with antituberculous drugs and corticosteroids (for one month) is started. Seven months after the new diagnosis, corticotherapy and immunosuppression with methotrexate were started.

Evolution
Since the first admission, she was re-evaluated after 2 months, where she was afebrile and asymptomatic, except for a slight bilateral visual deficit. Despite the negative results confirming tuberculous meningitis, the clinical-analytical improvement (lumbar puncture was repeated) led to maintaining treatment with tuberculostatics. Seven months later he was readmitted a third time for left peripheral facial paralysis. On this admission, the diagnosis was reconsidered and the tests were repeated. The lumbar puncture was similar to previous ones (persistent hyperproteinorrache, borderline glucose and low cellularity with 8 mononuclear cells), CSF ACE was negative and serum ACE was 54 (normal reference value 52); however, the thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed enlarged mediastinal and abdominal adenopathies with the appearance of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. In view of this finding, fibrobronchoscopy of the lymphadenopathies was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsies were taken, with a low CD4/CD8 ratio (which did not favour, but did not exclude, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis). Still awaiting pathological anatomy and review of the results at the outpatient clinic, she was admitted a fourth time 2 months later for right facial paralysis, before it resolved on the contralateral side. The results of the pathological anatomy revealed non-necrotising granulomatous sarcoid-type granulomatous inflammation. At this point, tuberculostatic treatment was discontinued and it was decided to start immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate.
