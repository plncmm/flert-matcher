A 56-year-old man presented with parainfluenza symptoms and hyperthermia of three days' duration. He had a history of hypertension, controlled by Valsartan tablets. He owned a shop and denied having travelled or had contact with infected persons. The patient was admitted and given antibiotics and antipyretics. Haematological tests and chest X-ray were normal, RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was negative, despite increased intensity of cough, dyspnoea and fever. Four days later, RT-PCR testing was positive for SARS-CoV-19. The patient's condition worsened; on day 6 of hospitalisation, he presented with dyspnoea, fever, cough, tachycardia and hypoxaemia, with diffuse bilateral crackles on chest examination, oxygen saturation was 80% which increased to 90% with 8L of oxygen, respiratory rate was 40 r.p.m., temperature was 39.5 Celsius, respiratory frequency was 40 r.p.m., and temperature was 39.5 Celsius, temperature was 39.5 C, PaO2: 61mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 122mmHg with 10L O2 with nasal cannula, alveolo-arterial gradient: 65. A complete blood count revealed lymphocytopenia; serum ferritin was 650ng/ml, C-reactive protein was 45mg/dL and ESR was 91. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral diffuse infiltration in the lower area; chest CT showed annular consolidation in the left upper lobe around a small area of ground-glass opacity (halo or atoll sign), bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities in the lower lobe. The patient was given non-invasive oxygen therapy, meronepem i.v. 1 gm three times daily, tamiflu tablet 75 mg twice daily, Kaltetra tablet 400/100 mg twice daily, hydroxychloroquine tablet 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily thereafter, enoxaparin 4000 IU daily subcutaneously, acetaminophen on demand; valsartan was replaced by amlodipine. Over the next four days, the patient worsened, oxygen saturation dropped to 70-80% on 10L oxygen; PaO2: 56mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 93, alveolo-arterial gradient: 75; D-dimer: 1992ng/ml, serum ferritin: 692 ng/mLn, C-reactive protein: 93mg/dl, ESR: 110, with normal renal function tests, liver function tests, echocardiogram, troponin and serum electrolytes. In addition to the medication, the patient received 200 ml of convalescent serum from a recovered moderate COVID-19 patient, after the necessary donor plasma tests (haemoglobinaemia and viral tests). Seventy hours later, the patient started to improve, fever subsided, dyspnoea decreased and lymphocyte counts normalised. Six days after the plasma transfusion, he had the following values: D-dimer 1887 ng/ml, PaO2: 81mmHg, PaO2/FiO2:162mmHg with 10L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Chest X-ray showed improvement of consolidations and ground-glass opacities; chest CT showed disappearance of pleural effusion. The patient was discharged 21 days after admission in good health. Three consecutive RT-PCR tests spaced 24 hours apart were negative.
