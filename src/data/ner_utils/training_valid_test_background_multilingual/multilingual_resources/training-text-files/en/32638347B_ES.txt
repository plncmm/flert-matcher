A 90-year-old dependent woman living in a nursing home with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism and severe neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease). COVID-19 was suspected in early April 2020 based on a clinical picture of cardiorespiratory decompensation, atrial fibrillation and fever, and confirmed on 5 April with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal sample (Ct of 21). She was hospitalised in a COVID-19 ICU. A chest CT scan revealed signs of bilateral pleural effusion, without typical signs of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. The patient received several doses of preventive anticoagulants (the risk ratio did not favour therapeutic anticoagulant therapy), diuretics and antibiotics (ofloxacin), as well as 5 days of prednisolone at 40 mg/day. Clinical improvement was noted and the patient was transferred to a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit on 21 April, before being able to return to her residence on 7 May. The patient continued to present with inflammatory syndrome with stable C-reactive protein at 55 in chronic pressure ulcer conditions. Her second hospitalisation, in an acute ICU at COVID-19 on 11 May, was caused by the onset of severe dehydration with hypernatraemia measured at 166 mmol/L, oxygen saturation of 93% on four litres of oxygen, melena and a clear deterioration of her general condition. Analysis revealed clear lymphocytopenia 0.18 Giga/L and C-reactive protein at 181 ng/L. The SARS-CoV-2 test by RT-PCR was positive from a nasopharyngeal swab (Ct of 18.8) on 6 May. On 14 May, after worsening respiratory status, a chest CT scan revealed pulmonary condensation and bilateral diffuse cobblestone pattern involving approximately 25-50% of the lung parenchyma, with bilateral proximal lobar pulmonary embolism. No serological testing was performed. After discussion with the family and interdisciplinary validation, it was decided to apply palliative care. The patient died on 19 May.
