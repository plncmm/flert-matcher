Anamnesis
44-year-old male, with chronic enolic habit (40g/day) and history of CDC group A2 HIV-1 infection diagnosed in 1993, on treatment with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirez with undetectable viral load and CD4=846 cells/ μl, as well as chronic hepatitis C, genotype 4 of recent diagnosis (untreated), who was referred to the dermatology department for presenting blisters on the back of the hands that had been evolving for 4 months in the context of minor trauma in this area, which had broken, resulting in wounds that healed leaving scars.

Physical examination
Examination revealed the presence of tense blisters of serous content measuring 0.51cm on the dorsum of the hands and both forearms, as well as superficial erosions and serohaematic crusts. He had an isolated lesion of similar characteristics on the auricles.
The patient had an isolated lesion of similar characteristics on the auricular pavilions. There were also residual atrophic scars with hypopigmentation in the periphery and some millium cysts. On the face, at the periocular level and on both cheeks, there was melasma-type pigmentation and slight malar hypertrichosis.

Complementary examinations
- Biochemistry: GPT 80 (5-45 U/l), GOT 49 (5-37 U/l), GGT 117 (8-61 U/l). Glucose, cholesterol, renal function and ions without alterations.
- Haemogram: Hb 17.2 g/dl, haematocrit 49.6 (39.1-49.7%).
- Iron profile: Iron 192 (59-158 μg/dl), Ferritin 440 (30-400ng/ml), Transferrin 230 (200360mg/dl), % transferrin saturation 53 (20-50%). Cerulopasmin 27 (15-30 mg/dl). Alpha-1-antitrypsin 150 (90-200mg/dl).
- Serology: Positive for HCV with detectable viral load (14.00IU/ml) and positive for HIV with undetectable viral load. Other serologies negative.
- Porphyrins in 24-hour urine: Screening total porphyrins 4773 (10-200) with the presence of a high intensity peak at 623nm in the fluorometric scan. Coproporphyrins 1709 (< 150 μg/gr), Uroporphyrins 3064 (< 30 μg/gr), Delta-aminolevulinic acid 5.52 (< 7.50 mg/l), Porphobilinogen 1.31 (< 2.50 mg/l).
- Total plasma porphyrins: 9.5 (0.1 μg/dl).
- Histological study of a blistering lesion showed a subepidermal blister surrounded by mixed inflammatory infiltrate as well as PAS-positive deposition of fibrillar material at perivascular level in superficial dermis. Immunofluorescence revealed IgG deposition in the vessel walls.

Diagnosis
Based on clinical, analytical and histological features the patient was diagnosed with Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT).

Treatment
After diagnosis the patient was referred to the infectious disease unit where treatment for Hepatitis C was started with interferon alpha and ribavirin. We insisted on the importance of eliminating clinical triggers (trauma, alcohol consumption) and on the use of photoprotection. On the other hand, given the presence of alterations in the ferrokinetic profile, we recommend periodic bleeding every 15 days.

Evolution
After 4 months of treatment, serological cure of the Hepatitis C was observed, maintaining an undetectable viral load to date, as well as normalisation of the ferrokinetic profile and great improvement in the porphyria with practically complete resolution of the skin lesions and progressive reduction of the profirin levels in blood and urine.
