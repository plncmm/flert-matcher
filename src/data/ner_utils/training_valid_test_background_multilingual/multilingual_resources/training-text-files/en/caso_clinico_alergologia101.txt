A 43-year-old man with rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass and olive tree pollens, extensive LTP syndrome (fresh and processed fruit and vegetables), nut allergy and intolerance to NSAIDs who, after drinking horchata (a year earlier), developed anaphylaxis.

A prick test was performed with a commercial extract of fruits, nuts and pollens. Prick by prick with horchata, tiger nut extract, peach and apple skin and pulp and CAP to them. SDS PAGE and Western Blot were performed.

Prick positive to nuts, fruits and peach skin, apple, gramineae legumes, olive, ash and cupressaceae. Profilin negative. CAP >0.35 fruits (peach 13.60 IU/ml), nuts (Arah2 <0.35, rPrup3 16.20 IU7ml, rPrup4 <0.35), legumes and pollens.

WESTERN BLOT: SDS PAGE and Western blot were performed recognising proteins of 25 and 47 kDa and also a band of 14 kDa.
