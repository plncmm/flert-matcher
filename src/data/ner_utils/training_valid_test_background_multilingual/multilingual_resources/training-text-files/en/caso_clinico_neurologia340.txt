Anamnesis
70-year-old woman, with a history of hypothyroidism on hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine and latent tuberculosis infection, for which she had received chemoprophylactic treatment in 2007. Urinary incontinence and habitual constipation.
The patient came to her referral hospital with a clinical picture of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that had been going on for hours. On the same day of her admission, the patient woke up asymptomatic, went for a walk as usual and, on returning home, told her relatives that she was very sleepy. Subsequently, she presented with abdominal pain in the epigastrium with nausea and vomiting, for which she went to the emergency department. She was admitted to the Digestive System Department with a diagnosis of epigastralgia to be studied. During her stay on the ward she showed a tendency towards somnolence and bradypsychia, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14. On the third day of admission she presented a generalised seizure with post-critical left hemiparesis. An urgent cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and, in view of the findings, she was referred to our centre by the Neurology Department to continue the aetiological study.

Physical examination
Afebrile. Blood pressure 135/78 mmHg. Heart rate 76 bpm. Oxygen saturation 99%. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart tones, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no extra sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, peristalsis present, no masses or megaliths, with pain on palpation at the epigastric level but no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Neurological examination: tendency to somnolence, with response to intense verbal stimuli. Significant bradypsychia. Moderate dysarthria, diminished verbal fluency, obeys two simple commands, then becomes intoxicated. Mild left facial-brachial haemiparesis: left upper limb 4+/5. Left extensor cutaneous-plantar reflex.

Complementary tests
- CBC: normal haemogram. Coagulation: D-dimer 3,482.97 ng/ml. Biochemistry: sodium 128 mmol/l, potassium 3.2 mmol/l, calcium 7.6 mg/dl, the rest normal, including liver profile.
- Chest X-ray: no significant pleuroparenchymal alterations.
- Thoracic CT angiography: bilateral subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).
- Urgent cranial CT scan (without/with contrast): effacement of the cortical sulci and the right sylvian fissure. Poor cortico-subcortical differentiation with presence of extensive hypodense area in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Contrast uptake at the level of the right sulci. All of the above was suspected as a possible subacute ischaemic infarction with signs of haemorrhagic transformation.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at 24 hours: cortical hyperintensity in T2 and FLAIR at the level of the right temporal lobe, associated with effacement of sulci and fissures and marked cortical thickening, very evident at the level of the right parahippocampal region, with total collapse of the temporal horn and partial collapse of the lateral ventricle. Diffusion restriction. After contrast administration, gyriform leptomeningeal and right insular enhancement is observed. Urgent MRI. T2 sequence showing hyperintensity in the right mesial temporal region, with involvement of the hippocampus, parahippocampal structures, lateral temporal gyri and right insula. Diffusion sequence with diffusion restriction.
- Brain MRI (at 20 days): leptomeningeal and intraparenchymal gyriform uptake is still present. Improvement of cortical oedema, with absence of clear diffusion restriction.
- Brain MRI (at 33 days): hyperintense lesion in T2 and FLAIR, located at the right fronto-temporo-parietal level, predominantly insular, with multiple cystic areas and necrohaemorrhagic transformation. After contrast administration, gyriform uptake persisted at the right insular level, with large intraparenchymal nodules with peripheral enhancement. Control MRI. Hyperintense lesion in T2 with multiple cystic areas and areas of bleeding. Peripheral enhancement after contrast administration.
- Urgent electroencephalogram (EEG): almost continuous epileptiform activity at the right temporal level in the form of
hypervolved sharp waves, sometimes discharging pseudoperiodically, sometimes completely chaotically. They often diffuse to the ipsilateral centroparietal region. Periods of few seconds of electrical silencing. Tracing compatible with status epilepticus.
- EEG (at 28 days): diffuse cerebral slowing with clear signs of damage at left temporal level.
- Urgent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): normal biochemistry, normal adenosine deaminase (ADA), negative herpes virus group genome amplification, negative culture of bacteria, mycobacteria (Lowenstein) and viruses.
- CSF (at 13 days): normal biochemistry, normal ADA, cytology negative for malignancy, antineuronal and anti-N-methyl-Daspartate receptor antibodies (anti-rNMDA) negative, protein 14.3.3 negative.
- Mantoux negative.
- Thyroid hormones: normal.
- Antithyroid antibodies: negative.
- Tumour markers: negative.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan: no mass suggestive of neoplasia.

Diagnosis
- Refractory non-convulsive status epilepticus.
- Right temporal cortical signal alteration secondary to status epilepticus.
- Intracranial space-occupying lesion of uncertain origin.

Treatment and evolution
The patient was transferred to our centre with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke in the territory of the LMCA according to the urgent cranial CT scan report. After the initial evaluation of the patient, we considered a wider range of diagnostic possibilities. An urgent EEG was performed, which was compatible with non-convulsive status and intravenous treatment with antiepileptic drugs was started. Given the refractoriness to the fourth line of treatment, he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for barbiturate coma, which was maintained for a week until the status was electrically controlled. After withdrawal of sedative drugs and once on the ward, the patient maintained a low level of consciousness, evolved into a deep coma and died 3 months after the onset of the clinical condition. Due to institutional problems we were unable to perform a necropsy.
What were our main diagnostic hypotheses? Initially, the possibility of herpetic encephalitis was considered and treatment with acyclovir was started. Due to the negative microbiological study, it was subsequently withdrawn. The possibility of pneumococcal or tuberculous meningitis was also ruled out given the patient's history. A diagnosis of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis of the autoimmune type due to anti-NMDA antibodies was also considered, given that it is associated with a rapid deterioration in the level of consciousness and refractory epilepsy requiring admission to the ICU, as in our case, but this was ruled out after the negative bioimmunological study in CSF. In addition, we had against us the poor clinical evolution despite having received treatment with corticosteroids and the absence of systemic neoplasia (related in these cases more frequently to ovarian teratoma). Due to her history of hypothyroidism, thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies were requested in blood, which were negative, so Hashimoto's encephalopathy was excluded as the cause of the neurological deterioration. CSF 14.3.3 protein was also requested to rule out prion disease, which was negative.

Finally, after analysing the clinical and radiological evolution of the patient, our diagnostic impression to date, despite not having histological confirmation, is that her coma was the clinical expression of a non-convulsive status caused by underlying brain damage that initially manifested as a lesion with an inflammatory appearance at the right cortical level attributable to the status, with a tendency towards resolution after control of the same and, subsequently, progression of a space-occupying lesion with a tumour-like appearance at the right insular level, suggestive of malignancy. We think that the PTE could be related to a prothrombotic state, of paraneoplastic origin.
