Personal history
Patient from Senegal who had been living in Spain for eight years. He travelled to Senegal several months before the consultation. No other history of interest.

Present illness
For the last four months the patient presented with an increase in the diameter of the left lower limb, with no other notable symptoms.

Physical examination
On examination, the patient presented lymphoedema in the left lower limb, grade II-III. There were no areas of lichenification, dermatitis or subcutaneous nodules.

Complementary examinations
The haemogram was normal, without eosinophilia. IgE levels were elevated (425.8 IU/mL). Chest and abdominal X-rays and Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs were normal except for the finding of reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy. An abdominopelvic CT scan showed bilateral inguinal adenopathies, mainly on the left, with dilated lymphatics at that level. Subcutaneous tubular structures compatible with lymphatics were visualised in the left flank.

Clinical judgement
Probable lymphatic filariasis.

Evolution
No haemoparasites were observed in the Knott tests performed (at 12, 22, 24 and 2 hours). Serology for lymphatic filariasis IgG (G1-G2-G3-G4) and PCR for filariasis and Loa loa were negative. A lymphography was also performed, where no obstructions, dilatations or lymphatic collateral circulation were observed. The patient did not attend subsequent follow-up examinations, so his current status is unknown.

Filariasis is caused by nematodes called filariae and transmitted by arthropod bites. Most typically, Wuchereria bancrofti causes perineal and genital lymphoedema, and Brugia malayi in the lower limbs. In Onchocerca volvulus infections, keratitis and chorioretinitis - with risk of blindness - are associated with asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules, while Loa loa involvement is characterised by migratory oedema and conjunctivitis.
