A 25-year-old female patient diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and under treatment with infliximab attended the Emergency Department for right rib pain, fever and dyspnoea. It was decided to admit her for ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, considering that this was severe pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient.
Three days after admission, and given the persistence of fever, the chest X-ray was repeated, with radiological worsening and the appearance of a small right pleural effusion. No sample of the pleural effusion was obtained by thoracentesis as it was small. Linezolid was started to cover gram-positive germs, despite which the patient's general condition was poor, with no defervescence, respiratory failure and radiological worsening. For this reason, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where antibiotic treatment was changed to meropenem and linezolid. A chest CT scan was performed to rule out other complications, such as abscesses or necrotising pneumonia.
Diagnostic thoracentesis prior to starting meropenem showed fluid with characteristics of inflammatory exudate, without empyema criteria, where Fusobacterium necrophorum grew. On re-examination, the patient reported that two weeks earlier she had had a catarrhal episode with a sinusitis component and abundant rhinorrhoea, for which she had been taking amoxicillin first, and then azithromycin for 3 days. On presenting a clinical worsening, she decided to go to the emergency department, from where she was admitted.
With meropenem, the patient improved, was transferred to hospital, and a few days later was discharged.
