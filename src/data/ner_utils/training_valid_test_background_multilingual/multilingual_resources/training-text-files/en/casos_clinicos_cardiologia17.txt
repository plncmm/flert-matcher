A 58-year-old man was admitted to the Cayetano Heredia Hospital with a 2-month history of vomiting, fever of 38°C and severe disabling back pain. Clinical examination revealed a multifocal holosystolic murmur, predominantly in the mitral focus of intensity III/VI, radiating to the axilla and neck. Positive Lasegue and Psoas sign, as well as positive Dandy sign at L3, L4 and L5.

Laboratory data obtained on admission were: haemoglobin: 12.2 g/dl, haematocrit: 38%, leucocyte count: 14.01/μl (neutrophils: 64.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 116 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP): 1/16 mg/l. Chest X-ray showed no signs of condensation. 
Similarly, the electrocardiographic tracing at rest showed no relevant alterations.

Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral and aortic valve involvement characterised by vegetations on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (atrial and ventricular surface of segment A2) and a 1.6 x 1.3 cm perforated aneurysm (0.7 cm) with severe regurgitation. Likewise, multiple vegetations were found on the aortic valve in all three leaflets, the largest measuring 0.9 cm, with severe regurgitation and flow compatible with perforation of the posterior semilunar leaflet.

Streptococcus gordonnii was isolated in blood cultures. In addition, the lumbosacral MRI showed vertebral osteomyelitis of L4-L5.

During surgery, the above findings were confirmed and a bivalvular aortic and mitral replacement with mechanical prosthesis implantation was performed.
