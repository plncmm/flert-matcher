Anamnesis
A 20-year-old female patient with no known drug allergies, smoker of 10 cigarettes a day, with a history of extrinsic allergic asthma, migraine with aura, recurrent urinary tract infections and chronic constipation. She was transferred from another centre for the study and treatment of tetraparesis in the context of abdominal pain with hyponatraemia (up to 105 mEq/l), bilirubinuria and choluria, as well as dysautonomic symptoms and hyporeflexia.

Physical examination
The patient was tachycardic (heart rate 120 bpm), febrile (temperature 37 oC), peak flow of 150 cc and cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed peripheral facial paresis with Bell's sign, dysphagia, generalised areflexia except for the presence of Achilles reflexes, bilateral skin-plantar flexor reflex, significant piloerection and sweating. He also has tetraparesis with muscle balance (right/left): deltoid 0/0, triceps 0/1, biceps 1/1, carpal flexor 0/2+, interosseous 1⁄2, carpal extensor 0/0, flexor digitorum 2/2, extensor digitorum 2/2, psoas 3-/4+, quadriceps 1/0, hamstrings 3/4-, triceps suralis 3/3 and tibialis anterior 3+/4.

Complementary tests
- Admission blood tests. CBC: haemoglobin 8.9 g/dl, haematocrit 27%, MCV 77.1 fl, MCH 25 pg, platelets 260 K/mcl, leukocytes 9.1 K/mcl. Biochemistry: glucose 88 g/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, creatinine 0.50 mg/dl, sodium 134 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l. Urinalysis: positive for leucocytes and nitrites. Urine culture positive for Escherichia coli.
- Control laboratory tests: ESR 114 mm; folates 7.88, cobalamins 1002.
- Haemogram: no changes.
- Biochemistry: total protein 6.9 mg/dl, GOT 70 IU/l, GPT 73 IU/l, GGT 45 IU/l, FA 128 IU/l. Ionogram: no alterations.
- Proteinogram: albumin 39.9%, alpha-1 globulin 6%, alpha-2 globulin 14%, beta globulin 15%, gamma globulin 25.1%.
- Autoimmunity study: negative.
- Urine toxicity: negative.
- Tumour markers: alpha-fetoprotein and Ag CA-125: negative.
- Serology: Treponema, HCV and HIV negative.
- 24-hour urine study: urine coproporphyrins 1,771 mg/24 h, urine total porphyrins 11,552 mg/24 h, urine porphobilinogen 13.9 mg/24 h, urine uroporphyrins 9,781 mg/24 h.
- Genetic study: heterozygosis for the c.835_837delACTinsG mutation in exon 14 of the HMBS gene.
- Blood tests at discharge: - CBC: erythrocytes 3.63 M/mcl, haemoglobin 10.4 g/dl, haematocrit 31%, mean corpuscular volume 84.7 fl, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 29 pg, platelets 340 K/mcl, leukocytes 7.7 K/mcl. - Biochemistry: creatinine 0.36 mg/dl, cholesterol 224 mg/dl, triglycerides 212 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) > 60 ml/min. - Ionogram: normal.
- CSF analysis: glucose 74 mg/dl; leukocytes 40/mm3 (60% mononuclear), proteins 17 mg/dl.
- Electromyogram (EMG) (initial): findings suggestive of generalised, severe, axonal-predominant polyradiculoneuropathy.
- EMG (control): findings compatible with axonal neuropathy, acute, very severe, involving all four limbs but with greater involvement of the upper limbs. Current examination suggests acute motor axonal neuropathy.
- Somatosensory evoked potentials with no signs of posterior chordal pathway involvement.

Diagnosis
The patient was admitted from another centre with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome, having started treatment with immunoglobulins, with little clinical response. Given the picture of abdominal pain with the aforementioned analytical alterations, hypercellularity in the CSF and the results of the EMG, the study of the picture was extended by considering the possible differential diagnoses of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The autoimmunity and serology studies were negative, but in the presence of uroporphyrins in urine and with a compatible clinical picture, the patient was diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Subsequently, the porphyria study is completed according to the recommendations of the Porphyria Unit of the reference centre, and a mutation compatible with PAI is finally determined, thus confirming the diagnosis.

Treatment
Treatment is started with haemin and vitamin supplements (folic acid and vitamin B12), glucose, sodium and potassium levels are strictly controlled and drugs that worsen the disease are studied in order to avoid them.

Evolution
With the administration of haemin, the patient shows a progressive symptomatic improvement. Muscle balance 53 days after admission was (right/left): neck flexor 3/3, neck extensor 3/3, deltoid 3/3, biceps 2+/2+, triceps 2-/2-, carpal extensor 3/3, carpal flexor 3/3, interosseus 2/2, psoas 4/4, quadriceps 3+/4, triceps suralis 3/3, tibialis anterior 4+/4 and plantar flexion 4/3+. Given the good evolution of the patient to the specific treatment of the diagnosed disease, it was decided to transfer her to a rehabilitation centre to continue the intensive treatment.
