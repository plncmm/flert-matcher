Clinical history
A 76-year-old woman, with no personal history of interest, consulted for very pruritic skin lesions of 6 years' evolution. The patient did not link the appearance of these lesions to any trigger. The complementary examinations requested, haemogram, general biochemistry, liver virus serology (HBV and C), HIV, lues, thyroid and autoimmunity profile, chest X-ray and tuberculin test (PPD) showed only alterations in glucose 171 mg/dl, glycosylated haemoglobin 8.33, triglycerides 386 mg/dl and total cholesterol 221 mg/dl.

Physical examination
There was a bilateral, symmetrical rash consisting of purplish papules, some even purpuric, with a hyperkeratotic centre, which converge in a retiform morphology, mainly on the flexor surface of the upper limbs, the axillary folds, the root of the lower limbs and the groin, and on the trunk. There was no involvement of the rest of the skin, nails or mucous membranes.


Histopathology
Histological examination of a skin biopsy showed the presence of irregular epidermal acanthosis with hyperparakeratosis and follicular horny plugs, and in the dermis, a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with a lichenoid band arrangement, with foci of vacuolar damage of the epidermal basal layer, dilated blood vessels in the superficial plexus without vasculitis, and some extravasated red blood cells.

Diagnosis
Chronic lichenoid keratosis.

Evolution and treatment
Topical treatment with calcipotriol /betamethasone cream and oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight was prescribed, resulting in a significant decrease in pruritus and resolution of the papular lesions, leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmented patches, after 4 weeks of treatment.
