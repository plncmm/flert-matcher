85-year-old man with a history of hydatidosis with multiple peritoneal and hepatic cysts, operated on 4 occasions (the last in 2011). He was refused further surgery due to his age and comorbidities. He came to the emergency department for fever and cough with brownish expectoration. Examination showed right basal hypoventilation. Laboratory tests showed Hb 11.2 g/dl, leukocytes 4680/μl (neutrophils 3051/μl, eosinophils 88/μl) and CRP 60.6 mg/L. Chest X-ray showed increased right basal density. He was admitted to the internal medicine ward for right basal pneumonia and empirical treatment was started with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. New complementary tests were requested: sputum culture in which Klebsiella oxytoca sensitive to cephalosporins was isolated; serology for E. granulosus, which was positive; and a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan showing multiple liver cysts, condensation in the right lower lobe secondary to dissemination of a hydatid cyst in the hepatic dome (12x8.5 cm), hiatal hernia with marked dilatation of the oesophagus due to gastric compression by multiple peritoneal cysts and a single intrasplenic cyst. All of them at different stages of evolution, some with a calcific component. Given the results of the tests requested at discharge, antibiotic therapy was changed to cefuroxime and albendazole was prescribed for 6 months on an outpatient basis.
