A 13-year-old female patient, allergic to grass pollen, was referred to our clinic for presenting right nasal congestion without rhinorrhoea with right maxillary pain and right malar erythema of two months' evolution refractory to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and several courses of antibiotics. She was afebrile. Nasofibroscopy showed oedema of the nasal mucosa and right inferior and middle turbinate with no other signs. Sinus X-ray showed partial opacification of the right maxillary sinus. Oral and topical nasal corticosteroid treatment was prescribed. As the symptoms persisted one month later, a CT scan of the sinuses was requested. While waiting for the scan to be performed, the patient brought in a worm specimen that she said had emerged from her right nostril the previous night. Microbiological analysis confirmed Enterobius vermicularis infection. Albendazole 400 mg as a single dose was prescribed, with progressive improvement of the clinical picture over the following months. No further specimens were observed in the nostril during further examinations.
