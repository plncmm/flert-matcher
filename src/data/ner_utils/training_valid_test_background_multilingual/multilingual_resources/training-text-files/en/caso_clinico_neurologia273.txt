Anamnesis
A 47-year-old woman consulted for progressive pulsating holocranial headache of four months' duration and blurred vision.
Personal history: hypertension, cholesteatoma in the right ear and anxious syndrome treated with benzodiazepines. The patient reported pain "all over the head" that had been progressively increasing in recent weeks. It was characterised by a clear worsening when moving from decubitus to seated position, subsequently subsiding spontaneously. Occasionally he was awakened at night. For the past 15 days, he had also been experiencing pulsatile tinnitus without specifying the side, episodes of transient visual obscuration lasting minutes and photopsias on getting out of bed. There were no symptoms of systemic disease, known neoplasms, anorexia or weight loss. No cognitive impairment, behavioural change, head injury or fever. He maintained good sphincter control.

Physical examination
The general and neurological physical examination revealed no focality. There were no signs of radiculopathy or spasticity. Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral papilledema, so she was admitted to Neurology for further investigation with suspicion of venous sinus thrombosis.

Complementary tests
- Complete blood count with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and thyroid hormones: normal.
- Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram performed on admission: normal.
- Serology for herpes group viruses, hepatotropic viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Borrelia and Brucella was also normal.
- Brain computed tomography (CT) showed as the only abnormality an increase in the size of the entire ventricular system, with a decrease in the cortical sulci.
- Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging with venous phase confirmed the previous findings without showing any other alteration, so the first diagnostic suspicion was ruled out.
- It was then decided to perform a lumbar puncture to continue the study, which presented, to our surprise, great difficulties, because although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) began to flow at an adequate pressure (15 cm H2O), after a few minutes it stopped flowing. The material that was extracted was of a high density and coagulated at room temperature. The appearance was xanthochromic-gelatinous, and the urgent cytobiochemistry showed a hyperproteinaemia of 539 mg/dl, with other normal values: glycaemia 92 mg/dl (glycaemia 154 mg/dl), 0 cells/Î¼l, ADA 1.4).
- In view of these results, a lesion was suspected at the CSF extraction site, and a complete spine MRI scan was performed, which showed an intradural extramedullary tumour mass in the cauda equina, measuring approximately 4 x 1.2 x 2.2 cm. The lesion occupied the entire spinal canal at L3 level with T1 intermediate signal, T2 intermediate to hyperintense signal, and intense intravenous gadolinium enhancement. T2-weighted MRI showing a space-occupying lesion at L3, with caudal hyperintensity at the level of L3 in cauda equina. It contained no images suggestive of haemorrhage or mucin, and no haemosiderin ring.


Diagnosis
Froin's syndrome and papilledema as the first manifestation of a spinal tumour.

Treatment
The patient was treated with dexamethasone 8 mg every 6 h and mannitol 20% 125 cc/12 h i.v. for 48 hours, with subsequent scheduled surgery and intraoperative neurophysiological control, in which a high-density mass encompassing several roots of the cauda equina was observed. Excision was subtotal due to the impossibility of dissecting the tumour without damaging the nerve roots. Histological examination revealed a diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma.

Evolution
Currently, the patient has been asymptomatic of her headache with complete resolution of the papilledema, highlighting only on examination a 4+/5 weakness of the right lower limb with vivid myotatic reflexes.
