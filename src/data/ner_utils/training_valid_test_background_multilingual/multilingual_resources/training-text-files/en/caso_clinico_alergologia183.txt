A 7-year-old boy, in foster care. Personal history: Becegeitis. At 3 years old treated for tuberculosis: axillary adenopathies and pulmonary granulomas with positive tuberculin. Recurrent skin infections and diarrhoea. Malnutrition. Dyspnoea on exertion.
Current weight loss of 3 kg, asthenia and diarrhoeic stools for the last 2 months. Cough and fever for the last 2 weeks. Complementary examinations: Chest X-ray and thoracoabdominal CT scan: patchy pulmonary consolidations with adenopathies in several lymph node chains, in periportal hepatic hilum and interaorto-caval area. Pulmonary function: moderate restrictive pattern. Initial suspicion of tuberculous reactivation led to tuberculostatic treatment. Lymph node biopsy: granulomatous inflammation with Langhans-type multinucleated cells and partially suppurative necrosis. BAAR and PCR Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, IGRA: negative. Immunological study: normal, except tetrazoyl blue test: pathological. Ileo-colonoscopy with biopsy: pancolitis. Genetic study detected a mutation in exon 2 of the CYBB gene on the short arm of the X chromosome (new mutation, not previously documented), leading to a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).
Current treatment: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + Itraconazole + Mesalazine + Corticoids currently on a tapering regimen. Evolution: favourable.
