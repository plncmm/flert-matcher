55-year-old patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia under treatment, presented with progressive dyspnoea of several weeks' evolution, asthenia, hyporexia and unquantified weight loss. No clinical findings in the anamnesis by systems.

Physical examination: mucocutaneous pallor, the rest of the patient was unremarkable.

Complementary examinations revealed
1.Iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin 4.5 g/dL, MCV 59 fL, MCH 15 pg/cell, iron 10 Î¼g/dL and ferritin <10 ng/mL).
De novo cardiomegaly on chest X-ray.

Initially the study is extended with:
- Gastro-Colonoscopy : Candida albicans infectious oesophagitis (microbiological confirmation) and internal haemorrhoids.
- Transthoracic echocardiography: severe pericardial effusion with partial systolic collapse of the right atrium.

Complete with:
- Extensive serological study: Negative
- Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) 1.6(0.0-1.0), other autoimmunity negative.
- Pericardial fluid study: serohematic aspect compatible with exudate. Bacteriological study, including mycobacteria, and pathological anatomy negative.
- Mantoux test: positive, with no evidence of mycobacterial infection (sputum, gastric juice, pericardial fluid).
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan: right cervical nodule, heterogeneous, with areas of high density suggesting hypervascular character and does not allow pheochromocytoma or glomus tumour to be ruled out. Calcified nodule in the right thyroid lobe.
- Catecholamines in blood and urine 24 hours: Normal.
- Bilateral mammography: No significant alterations
- PET-CT scan: Right laterocervical adenopathic conglomerate with moderate increase in metabolism.
She underwent exploratory cervicotomy, the intraoperative lymph node biopsy showed infiltration by papillary thyroid carcinoma of the follicular type, and total thyroidectomy was performed (multicentric papillary carcinoma) and central cervical emptying.
