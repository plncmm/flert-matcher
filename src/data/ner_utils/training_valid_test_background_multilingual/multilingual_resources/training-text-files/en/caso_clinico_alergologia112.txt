To study hypersensitivity to potato in a 6-year-old boy who consulted for refusal to eat and subsequent episodes of food vomiting after eating potato, as well as urticaria after eating eggs, nuts and carrots.

Material and methods:
Skin tests to pneumoallergens and food, prick-prick to food, total IgE, specific IgE and determination of SDS-Page and Immunoblotting were performed.

Results:
Skin tests to pneumoallergens were negative; with food, positivity was detected for egg, nuts (hazelnut, walnut and pine nut) and vegetables (potato and carrot). The prick-prick was positive for carrot (raw), potato (raw and cooked), raw egg white and walnut. Total IgE = 437 U/ ml, and IgE to egg white = 1.41 kU/L, hazelnut = 2.53 kU/L, potato >100 kU/L, ovomucoid = 2.02 kU/L, walnut = 8.89 kU/L, Cor a 1 = 2.38 kU/L, Jug r 1 = 3.08 kU/L, pine nut = 1.35 kU/L and carrot = 1.99 kU/L. SDS-PAGE was performed with a potato extract in which bands of approximately 43, 25 and 16 kDa were observed. Immunoblotting recognises 2 bands at 43 and 16 kDa, which coincide in molecular weight with the allergens Sol t 1 (patatin) and Sol t 4 (serine protease inhibitor 7) respectively.

Conclusions:
- The diagnosis of potato hypersensitivity due to sensitisation to Sol t 1 and Sol t 4 with concomitant hypersensitivity to carrot, egg, pine nut, walnut and hazelnut is confirmed.
