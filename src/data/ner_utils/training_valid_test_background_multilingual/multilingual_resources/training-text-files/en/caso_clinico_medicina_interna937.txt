We present the case of a 45-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea for approximately two weeks accompanied by palpitations. He worked in a florist's shop and reported no past history of interest. He denied recent travel or exposure to environmental toxic agents. Physical examination revealed fever of 38oC, tachypnoea, tachycardia, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air and bilateral midfield crackles. Chest X-ray showed bilateral parahilar alveolar opacification, and blood tests showed a leukocyte count of 16,920 leukocytes/Î¼L and a C-reactive protein value of 23 mg/dL, in addition to blood gases with: pH, 7.55; pCO2, 22 mmHg; bicarbonate, 19 mEq/L; and pO2, 56 mmHg.
On admission, treatment with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone was started, with poor response, and fever and general malaise persisted. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lung showed areas of increased density in both upper lobes and segment 6 suggestive of inflammatory-infectious lung disease. Pneumococcal and Legionella antigenuria, blood cultures and serology (acute phase) for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella and Coxiella were negative. Azithromycin (500 mg/ 24 hours) was then added on suspicion of atypical infection. Due to the poor response, bronchofibroscopy with transbronchial biopsy was performed. Pathology showed type II pneumocytic hyperplasia, inflammation of the alveolar wall and myxomatous degeneration of the alveolar septa, all compatible with acute organised fibrinoid pneumonia. Following the anatomopathological findings, treatment with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg was started and the fever and dyspnoea disappeared.
During the follow-up in consultations, the dose of corticosteroids was gradually reduced until it was discontinued after 3 months. The last follow-up chest CT scan showed no condensation or pulmonary lesions.
