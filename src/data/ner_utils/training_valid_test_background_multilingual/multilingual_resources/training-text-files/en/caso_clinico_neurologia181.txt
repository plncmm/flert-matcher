Anamnesis
A 54-year-old male, ex-smoker, hypertensive and dyslipidaemic, with no other relevant history, presented with an abrupt onset of binocular diplopia and a few days later began with intense lumbar pain radiating to the lower limbs (lower limbs) and a sensation of corkiness on the back of the thighs and soles. Subsequently, there was a loss of strength in the lower limbs that progressed over a month to the point of preventing ambulation. He was admitted to hospital and 48 hours later presented with paralysis of the right hemifacial muscles. The patient reported progressive enlargement of the right hemiscrotal muscles in recent weeks. No sphincter alteration. No constitutional syndrome or other symptoms.

Physical examination
Systemic examination: increase in size and consistency of the right testicle, with redness and pain on palpation.

Neurological examination: left ptosis. Pupils symmetrical and normoreactive. Paresis of the medial and inferior rectus of the left eye. Compatible with incomplete paresis of the left third cranial nerve. Peripheral right facial paresis. Paresis of the lower limbs, with balance 3-4/5 both proximally and distally, with greater weakness of the right lower limb. Hypotonia and areflexia of the lower limbs. Bilateral cutaneous-plantar flexor reflex. Tactoalgesic hypoaesthesia on the posterior aspect of the right thigh, leg and sole. Decreased positional and vibratory sensitivity in the MMII, the latter at L2 level. Rest normal.

Complementary tests
- CBC: CRP 1.58, LDH 690 IU/l, GGT 96 U/l. Chorionic gonadotropin beta-2 subunit, alpha-fetoprotein, CEA, PSA and urine test normal. Other findings were normal.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study: red blood cells 1/mcl; leukocytes 10/mcl; protein 160 mg/dl; glucose 55 mg/dl; LDH 50 IU/l; ADA 4.8 IU/l. Cytology first puncture negative. Second puncture: leucocytes 52/mcl (7.2% of B lambda + lymphocytes).
- Immunological study (including antionconeuronal): negative.
- Microbiological study: HIV, syphilis, hepatotropic virus, Brucella negative.
- Mantoux positive (18 mm).
- EMG: mild axonal motor polyradiculoneuropathy in the upper limbs and moderate-severe in the lower limbs, with greater involvement and neurophysiological signs of evolution at L5-S1 levels, bilateral, predominantly on the left. Cranial nerve involvement.
- MRI of the brain and complete spine with gadolinium: thickening and enhancement of nerve roots, predominantly sacral; lesions in the D10, D11 and S2 vertebral bodies. Right facial nerve enhancement.
- Testicular ultrasound: enlargement and diffuse heterogeneous echogenicity of both testicles and epididymides, more marked on the right side.
- Testicular biopsy: lymphoid neoplastic proliferation composed of large cells with karyocytoplasmic atypia and frequent mitoses. IHQ: CD20 +, CD10 -, MUM1 +, BCL2 +, BCL6 +, CD30 -. Proliferative index (Ki-67) 98%. Molecular study: clonal rearrangement of the IgH gene.
- PET/CT: hypercapillary lesions in the root of the pulmonary artery, kidneys, adrenals, testes, D11 and S2 vertebrae and sacral roots of the cauda equina.

Diagnosis
A 54-year-old man presented with low back pain and progressive subacute paraparesis, sequential involvement of several cranial nerves and enlargement of the right hemiscrotal. The topographical distribution of the paresis and the prominence of the pain suggest subacute lumbosacral polyradiculoneuropathy as a syndromic diagnosis. The following options are considered as the aetiological diagnosis:
1) tumour infiltration by haematological neoplasm (e.g. lymphoma) or less likely, solid tumour;
2) granulomatous infiltration (tuberculosis or sarcoidosis);
3) vasculitis, primarily panarteritis nodosa; and
4) Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and variants (e.g. acute sensory-motor axonal neuropathy).
Spinal MRI showed striking thickening and enhancement of the sacral spinal roots suggestive of infiltrative pathology. Coronal section of the spinal MRI after gadolinium. Diffuse thickening and enhancement of the lumbosacral roots. Axial section of the spinal MRI after gadolinium. Diffuse thickening and enhancement of the lumbosacral roots. Testicular ultrasound showed diffuse infiltration of both testicles, predominantly the right one. Testicular biopsy confirmed primary testicular large cell B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Despite the negative first cytology, a second lumbar puncture showed the presence of neoplastic B-lymphocytes in CSF. PET/CT showed renal, adrenal and bone extension and hyperenhancement of sacral roots and both testicles:
1) lumbosacral polyradiculoneuropathy and cranial multineuropathy due to lymphomatous invasion (neurolymphomatosis). 
2) Stage IV A large cell non-Hodgkin's B lymphoma.

Treatment
Polychemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab (CHOP-R) and intrathecal chemotherapy (cytosine arabinoside and corticosteroids) was started.

Evolution
He received 6 cycles of CHOP-R, with decreased testicular volume, negative CSF cytology and improved MMII strength. Subsequently, he received additional cycles, bone marrow autotransplantation and testicular radiotherapy. Currently, he remains clinically stable with no evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
