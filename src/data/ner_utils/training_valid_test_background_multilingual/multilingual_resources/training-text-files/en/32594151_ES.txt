A 6-week-old boy was admitted on 23 March 2020 to the paediatric emergency department of the University Hospital of Amiens (France) with fever (38.9°C) of 12 hours' duration. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation, with Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes of 10 and 10, respectively. The infant did not regurgitate after delivery. The birth weight was 3,160g. The mother was 25 years old with no relevant medical history and, one week before admission, presented ageusia and anosmia, without fever or other associated symptoms. The father was 28 years old and only reported anosmia the day before admission.
On initial examination in the paediatric emergency department, the child was in good general condition, but slightly tearful and hypotonic, was well fed with formula milk and weighed 5,000g. His temperature was 38.2°C, pulse 160 bpm, respiratory rate 30 bpm, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100% on room air and blood pressure 89/59 mmHg. The abdomen was soft; the liver was palpable 0.5 cm below the costal margin; the patient had no cough or dyspnoea. The rest of the examination findings were unremarkable.
Laboratory tests on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 8,500/mm3 (normal range: 5,000-18,000/mm3); lymphocytes 4,700/mm3 (normal range: 1,100-3,200/mm3); neutrophils 2. 000/mm3 (normal range: 1,800-6,300/mm3); haemoglobin (Hb) value of 10.9 g/dl (normal range: 9.4-14.1 g/dl) and thrombocyte count of 321,000/mm3 (normal range: 150,000-450,000/mm3). Lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 255 IU/L (normal range: 120-246 IU/L); renal and hepatic activity values were normal. Cytology and urine dipstick, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein did not give abnormal results. A rapid test for influenza A and B was negative. Because of the parents' symptoms, the child's age and symptoms (tearful, feverish and hypotonic), the child was admitted to the paediatric COVID-19 unit and aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures, cytobacteriological urinalysis and lumbar puncture were performed. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed from nasopharyngeal swabs, urine, faeces and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
A few hours after hospitalisation, the child presented with excessive crying and an abdominal ultrasound was performed, with no relevant results. Pending microbiological tests, treatment was started with cefotaxime (200 mg/kg per day in four doses) and gentamicin (5 mg/kg per day in one dose) and probiotics.
The patient's clinical condition improved 24 hours after hospitalisation, with gradual remission of fever and initial hypotonia.
Oropharyngeal swabs and stool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were negative; CSF cultures were sterile (for bacteria and viruses: SARS-CoV-2, enterovirus ribonucleic acid, human herpesvirus 6, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus). Although the test strip was negative, a few days later the laboratory confirmed positive for Citrobacter koseri in the cytobacteriological urine test, with good sensitivity to the ongoing antibiotic treatment.
Five days after admission, taking into account the good health status and the normal results of blood and microbiological tests, the patient was discharged with indications for home monitoring for the following three weeks. In addition, taking into account the child's age, the parents would be contacted by telephone every other day for the next two weeks to monitor the child's health status. For the presence of C. koseri in the urine and the results of the antibiogram, the child was prescribed amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for the next 6 days.
Finally, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool (relatively abundant), probiotics were prescribed for the next 2 weeks.
Two weeks after discharge, the child was in good health, afebrile and without diarrhoea or vomiting. Parents were advised to continue home monitoring, with a visit to the doctor if necessary.
