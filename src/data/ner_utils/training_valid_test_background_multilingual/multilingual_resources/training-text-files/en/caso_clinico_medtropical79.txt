42-year-old woman with end-stage chronic kidney disease, secondary to lupus nephropathy, and on peritoneal dialysis. History of four episodes of bacterial peritonitis and change of Tenckhoff catheter six months prior to admission due to catheter dysfunction. She was admitted for abdominal pain (with insidious onset, colicky, predominantly epigastric and mild intensity) and peritoneal fluid examination showed 3600 leukocytes/mm3 and 80% polymorphonuclear cells. Antibiotics (ceftazidime, amikacin and vancomycin) were started and she was discharged with apparent improvement, but due to persistent symptoms she was readmitted. Three peritoneal fluid samples during her hospitalisation tested positive for Fusarium spp. The Tenckhoff catheter was removed and amphotericin B deoxycholate was started for three days, followed by voriconazole. The patient responded favourably and continued outpatient treatment with voriconazole (4mg/kg every 12 hours orally).

Microbiological isolation and initial identification were performed at the Microbiology Service of the Guillermo Almenara National Hospital. The isolates were then sent to the Clinical Mycology Laboratory of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute of Tropical Medicine (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia) for molecular typing with amplification of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the ribosomal DNA and comparison of the sequences obtained with those of the GenBank or International Society for Human and Animal Mycology databases. All three isolates were identified as species of the Fusarium solani complex. In vitro susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute - CLSI (M38-A) methodology, showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all three isolates and for all three antifungals of >16 Î¼g/mL.
