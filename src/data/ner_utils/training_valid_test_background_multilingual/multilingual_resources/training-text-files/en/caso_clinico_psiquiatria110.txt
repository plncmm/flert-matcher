We present the case of a patient who developed Cotard's syndrome in the early puerperium, having had a pregnancy marked by severe anxiety and ended early by caesarean section.

BRIEF PSYCHOBIOGRAPHY:
- Lives in the parental home, living with her husband and son, as well as both parents and a brother.
- Low socio-cultural and economic level. Unemployed.

PSYCHIATRIC FAMILY HISTORY
- Mother and aunt with mild depressive symptoms.

MEDICAL-SURGICAL HISTORY
- Iron deficiency anaemia during the present pregnancy. Other uninteresting.
- GAV 3-1-1. Current pregnancy desired.
- Denies use of alcohol or drugs of abuse.

PERSONAL PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY
- Refers the presence of postpartum sadness after her first pregnancy, without requiring medical attention and without meeting diagnostic criteria for postpartum depression.
- Mourning reaction to the miscarriage suffered during her second pregnancy, without seeking medical or psychological help for this process.

CURRENT ILLNESS
Pregnant patient at an advanced stage of pregnancy (32 weeks) referred by her primary care physician to the community mental health team for multiple somatic complaints, as well as pregnancy-related symptoms, having ruled out organicity. After evaluation of the patient by means of psychopathological examination, the diagnostic orientation is of mixed type of adaptive disorder.

EVOLUTION
After the first visit to the mental health service, the patient did not return to the mental health service, although she did visit the hospital on several occasions. In the first 7 months of pregnancy she visited the emergency department on 19 occasions, being seen by the gynaecology department practically every time, the reasons for consultation being metrorrhagia, slight metrorrhagia, malaise, increased vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, "not noticing or noticing the baby less", slight trauma, anxiety, dysuria, vaginal spotting, abdominal discomfort, tingling all over the body, generalised tremor, generalised pruritus, sensation of dizziness, subjective sensation of weight loss.
Finally, the patient was admitted to the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department, from where she was referred to Liaison Psychiatry. She was assessed by a psychiatrist at the hospital on two occasions, at 32 and 33 weeks' gestation.
The reason for consultation was anxiety, a state of hyper-preoccupation and persistent ideas about the pregnancy process and fear of a fatal outcome (foetal death).
The psychopathological examination highlighted hypochondriacal cognitive ruminations and very repetitive, persistent thoughts about fears related to a poor evolution of the pregnancy, with significant emotional repercussions, presenting anxiety and sadness, which were initially assessed as possibly reactive to this content of the thought.
She did not present alterations of sensory perception, disorders of the ownership/intimacy of thought, phenomena of ego influence or other symptoms of a psychotic nature.
Possible treatment with an SSRI and lorazepam to combat hypochondriacal thoughts and anxiety was considered. However, given the patient's refusal to take medication and taking into account the advanced stage of gestation and the latency period of the SSRIs, psychotherapeutic support and relaxation techniques were chosen instead of psychotropic drugs.
Finally, the obstetrician decided to perform an emergency caesarean section due to suspicion of loss of foetal wellbeing. The caesarean section took place without complications. The newborn had an Apgar score of 5-6/9, umbilical cord pH 7.24 and Hb of 3.4 g/dl, requiring referral to the neonatal ICU. After the caesarean section, the patient was again assessed by the liaison psychiatrist.
The psychopathological examination revealed persistent, repetitive discourse, with hypochondriacal ideas of increasing pressure and affective repercussions (she believed she was infected or could catch an infection, worried about hair loss or weight loss during the pregnancy, which had already ended). During the visit to her newborn child in the neonatal ICU, multiple complaints of a somatic nature and persistent hypochondriacal ideas persist, as well as a new onset of motor slowing.
His discourse centred on ideas of contamination and illness became increasingly persistent and almost irreducible, for which reason his admission to the psychiatric ward was indicated, and a psychopathological examination on the psychiatric ward revealed a progressively diminishing environmental reactivity of mood and a marked psychomotor retardation.
His self- and allopsychic orientation and level of consciousness did not show any alterations. The repetitive hypochondriacal ideas are acquiring a delirious character: the patient maintains the firm and irrefutable belief that she is going to die "because I have not healed properly from the quarantine...I am rotten inside...I am fading away...". In addition to the hypochondriacal delusions, there are ideas of harm, believing that we are going to make a report to take the children away from her. She cries frequently, saying that "I am going to die and I will never see my son again....", "you are going to take the children away from me because I am not well".
Slowing of thought, language and motor skills increase over the next few days, increasing the latency of verbal response, sometimes even blocking speech. Hypochondriacal delusions then come to the fore: "I came with an infected caesarean section...my intestines have come out, I am empty inside, I am rotting...I am dying...", with nihilistic, empty and rotting content, with the Cotard's syndrome becoming fully structured.
At times she appears perplexed, semi-stupefied. She also begins to show rigidity on passive mobilisation. Although she does not maintain fixed postures, if her arm is raised, for example, she slowly lowers it and may remain in an anatomical posture for several minutes. Thus, melancholic stupor with Cotard's syndrome and catatonic symptoms are fully established.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
- Normal haemogram, biochemistry, liver and renal function tests. Normal thyroid function.
- Normal B12 and folates.
- Normal cranial CT scan.
- Normal rheumatic tests.
- Serology lues, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Borrelia, Ricketsias: no findings.

DIAGNOSTIC ORIENTATION
Given this clinical course, the case was classified as a Major Depressive Episode with psychotic symptoms (F32.3), Cotard's Syndrome.

CHOICE OF TREATMENT
Given the unavailability of ECT in our hospital, treatment was started with intravenous Clomipramine, which was later changed to oral, together with oral olanzapine to combat the psychotic symptoms. She is also treated with high doses of benzodiazepines (lorazepam) in order to control catatonic symptoms.

MONITORING AND EFFICACY OF TREATMENT
The response is slow but favourable, with initial improvement of catatonic rigidity (benzodiazepines), and later improvement of environmental mood reactivity and affective resonance, psychomotor retardation, bradypsychia and bradylalia. The last to be monitored, after about 5 weeks, are hypochondriacal delusions. After a home leave, the patient is almost fully recovered, eager to return home with her children. She is finally discharged and is followed up on an outpatient basis, with treatment with oral Clomipramine 150 mg/day + oral Olanzapine 10 mg/day.
