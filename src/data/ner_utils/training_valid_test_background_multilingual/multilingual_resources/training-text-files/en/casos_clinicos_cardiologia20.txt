A 43-year-old man, with no clinical history of interest, who 2 months prior to his diagnosis had a subacute onset of a peak fever of 39Â°C, predominantly in the evening, and pain, swelling and functional impotence in the right hand and left ankle. Physical examination revealed pain on palpation and inflammatory signs at the level of the carpus, second, third, fourth and fifth right metacarpophalangeal joints and left ankle with painful limitation of mobility in the first degrees in all arcs of movement, as well as auscultation of a diastolic murmur in the aortic focus. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytosis (16,000) with neutrophilia (85%); ESR, 52 mm/h, and CRP, 4.6 mg/dl. Haemostasis and biochemistry were normal. In the immunological study, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, immunoglobulins and complement were negative, as were serology for viruses and bacteria. Blood cultures were performed after the first febrile peak and before initiation of antibiotic therapy and were positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Chest X-ray showed a discrete bilateral pleural effusion and echocardiography showed severe aortic insufficiency with thickening of the valvular leaflets. With the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis due to E. faecalis, intravenous antibiotherapy with ampicillin and gentamicin was started, with progressive improvement of joint symptoms and fever and imaging findings, until the patient became asymptomatic.
