Seven-year-old male patient from Calatayud (Zaragoza, Spain), who came to the clinic with the presence of a foreign body on the scalp. The family reported having spent the previous week in a rural house in contact with animals, specifically sheep and horses. On physical examination, a tick (haematophagous arthropod) of the species Dermacentor marginatus was identified in the occipital region, which was removed without incident. After 48 hours, a papular lesion measuring 1 x 1 cm appeared, with minimal secretion and meliceric crusts, which was initially treated with topical mupirocin. 5 days after removal of the tick, the patient consulted again due to worsening of the lesion and the appearance of several retroauricular, cervical and occipital lymphadenopathies, fever and asthenia. Examination revealed a deep, ulcer-like lesion on the occipital scalp, measuring 3 x 3 cm, with erythematous borders and a necrotic centre. Ulcer on the scalp of our patient. Oral azithromycin was prescribed at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for 5 days and successive moist dressings with hydrogels and colloidal dressings were applied to the bedsore. The evolution was satisfactory, with complete healing after approximately 2-3 weeks.

Rickettsial serology was negative and both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of the lesion showed the presence of R. slovaca, confirming the origin of the clinical picture described.

Spain is currently one of the countries with the highest number of reported cases. Other species, such as Rickettsia raoultii or Rickettsia rioja, could cause a similar clinical picture.
