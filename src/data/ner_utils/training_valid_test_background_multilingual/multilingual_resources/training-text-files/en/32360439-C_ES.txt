An 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was brought to the emergency department with altered mental status and left hemiparesis. The family stated that there was no history of cough or fever, but reported that the patient had had frequent falls during the last week. The patient was intubated for airway protection and the stroke protocol was activated. Vital signs in the ED were significant for temperature (37.9°C), pulse (101 bpm) and blood pressure (130/77 mmHg). Physical examination showed left hemiplegia and aphasia. A value of 36 on the NIHSS scale was calculated. A cranial CT scan revealed an acute right MCA stroke. A craniomaxillofacial angiography showed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at origin and bilateral patchy apical pulmonary opacities. A perfusion scan revealed an infarct core of 305 cc in the right MCA and a surrounding ischaemic penumbra of 109 cc. The patient was not considered a candidate for neurosurgical intervention because of the large size of the infarct core. Based on the radiological findings, she was tested for COVID-19 infection by PCR, which was positive. Laboratory tests on admission showed leukocytosis with lymphocytopenia, elevated D-dimer (13966 ng/ml DDU), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (712 U/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (16.24 mg/dl). The patient's clinical picture was complicated by acute renal lesions and increasing oxygen requirements. On the third day of admission, her family decided on a palliative extubation with control measures.
