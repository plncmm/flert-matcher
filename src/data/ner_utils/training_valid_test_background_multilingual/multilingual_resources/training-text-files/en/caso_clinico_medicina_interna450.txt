We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient with a personal history of known HIV infection category C-3 since January 2001 (Nadir CD4 of 2 cells/mm3, baseline viraemia of 85,000 copies/mL, P.jiroveci pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), chronic hepatitis due to HCV treated and cured, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. He is currently on antiretroviral treatment with tenofovir, emtricitabine, darunavir and cobiscitat. The patient presented to the internal medicine department for progressive abdominal distension of two months' duration, accompanied by intermittent febrile fever and an early sensation of fullness. Laboratory tests showed a glomerular sedimentation rate of 30 mm, creatinine 1.17 mg/dL, total protein 6.4 g/dL, calcium corrected with albumin 9.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 25 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 U/L, gamma glutamyl transferase 18 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 142 U/L and C-reactive protein 109 mg/L. The immunomicrobiology study showed CD4 217 cells/mm3 and undetectable plasma HIV RNA viral load. The imaging tests performed are shown below:
The patient was therefore diagnosed with hepatic, splenic and renal granulomatosis probably secondary to P.jiroveci infection, an entity described in immunocompromised patients. In patients with HIV infection, reviewing the literature, the infectious aetiologies most frequently associated with the presence of hepatic granulomas are: M.tuberculosis, MAC, Cryptococcus neoformans, cytomegalovirus, P.jiroveci, histoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis1. Empirical corticosteroid treatment was started at low doses and the patient evolved favourably with biochemical response, clinical improvement with disappearance of the febrile fever and cessation of abdominal distension together with a decrease in the size of most of the existing granulomas.
