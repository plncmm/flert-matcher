Anamnesis
A 39-year-old woman, with a stable heterosexual partner, came to the clinic referred by her primary care doctor for lesions on her genitals that had been present for several months. Her only personal history was an allergy to ampicillin. She did not take drugs on a regular basis and did not report a history of previous genital lesions.

Physical examination
She presented multiple papuloplaques of between 0.5 and 1.5 cm with a flat surface, pinkish hue and moist appearance, with a tendency to ulceration. The lesions were located mainly on the labia majora, perineum and perianal region. There were no lesions on other parts of the skin or mucous membranes.

Complementary examinations
A complete blood test was performed which showed positive for luetic serology, with a positive RPR, with a titre of 1/128 and a TPHA (Anti Treponema pallidum Ac.) > 1/1280. All other serologies, including hepatitis B virus (HBs Ag and Anti HBc Ac), hepatitis C virus (Anti HCV Ac) and HIV (Anti HIV Ac) were negative.
Skin biopsy of one of the lesions showed a very dense inflammatory infiltrate formed by lymphocytes and very abundant plasma cells at the dermal level. The epidermis showed acanthosis and patches of parakeratosis, with abundant neutrophils. Eosinophils, neutrophils and isolated lymphocytes were present in the more superficial layers of the epidermis. The plasma cells in the infiltrate did not show light chain restriction and numerous spirochetes were observed in the more basal layers of the epidermis by anti-Treponema antibodies.

Diagnosis
Condyloma plana, secondary syphilis.

Treatment and course
A single dose of 2.4 million IU of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G benzathine was administered. The case was reported to the preventive medicine service of our hospital as it was a notifiable disease. However, the patient did not return for follow-up despite repeated attempts to locate her and her regular partner, so the follow-up was lost.
