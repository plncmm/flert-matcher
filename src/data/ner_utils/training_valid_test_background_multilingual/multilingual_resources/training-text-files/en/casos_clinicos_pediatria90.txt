A girl aged 1 year and 9 months started to suffer from diarrhoea and vomiting 3-4 times a day, irritability, classified as gastroenteritis. The symptoms subside with the exception of irritability, so she goes to the emergency department (ED) of the hospital 72 hours after onset.

FIRST VISIT TO THE ED (72 hours)
Reason for consultation: colicky abdominal pain. Physical examination Weight: 9.5 kg, Temperature: 36.5 oC, BEG, NH, NC, decreased but with adequate peripheral perfusion. No rash or petechiae. No alterations in the rest of the examination. Complementary tests: Urine sediment: negative. CBC: leukocytes 13400/ml (N45%, L 45%, M8%), Hb 13.6 gr/dl, Hcto 40%, platelets 478000/ml. Biochemistry: glucose, ions, urea and creatinine normal. CRP < 0.3 mg/dl. Abdominal X-ray: no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound: multiple lymph nodes of 3-5 mm in FID of reactive-inflammatory aspect. No images suggestive of intestinal invagination.

Evolution: She remained under observation for 20 hours and was discharged after ruling out abdominal pathology. During her stay, episodes of colicky abdominal pain were observed with hyperextension of the trunk and neck with lateral deviation, but without abnormal movement of the extremities, disconnection from the environment, or a blank stare.
Diagnosis: Post-enteritis non-specific abdominal pain vs Sandifer's syndrome. Treatment: Soft diet, paracetamol conditional to fever or pain and lansoprazole 15mg c/24h, and control by his paediatrician.

SECOND SU VISIT (4th day)
Due to persistent irritability, he went to the emergency department again, 24 hours after the previous visit, finding hyperemia in the right tympanum, with no other findings, so acute otitis media was diagnosed, and amoxicillin -clavulanic acid at 80mg/kg/day was indicated.
The patient improved clinically for a few days, but then resumed the irritation and episodes of cervical hyperextension. On the 20th day after the onset of the process, vomiting was added, which became more intense, so she went to the emergency department.

THIRD VISIT SU (20th day)
Patient presenting with emetic syndrome. Clinical examination with signs of moderate dehydration, with no other significant findings, peripheral cannulation, expansion with saline solution, fluid therapy and administration of ranitidine and ondansetron iv. Complementary tests: normal haemogram and biochemistry. She began oral tolerance, first to liquids and finally to solids, so she was discharged with a soft diet, oral rehydration, lansoprazole 15mg/day and evaluation by her paediatrician at 24 hours.
After 24 hours, she was evaluated by the primary care paediatrician who observed an episode of opisthotonos without loss of consciousness, and referred her to the emergency department for hospitalisation.

EVOLUTION
Admission for observation and study of neurological symptoms,
The fundus examination was normal, with no evidence of papilledema. After performing a complete MRI of the skull and spine, a lumbar puncture was performed, finding an elevated pressure (12 cm H2O) and normal cytobiochemical and microbiological tests. 24-48 hours after the procedure, there was a notable clinical improvement with disappearance of all the symptoms and signs reported in this episode. On the fourth day of hospitalisation, he began with abundant nasal mucus. Weight at discharge: 9,360 grams
