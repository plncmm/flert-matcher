Anamnesis
84-year-old male, hypertensive, ex-smoker. Left hemispheric ischaemic strokes in 2000 and 2005. Amputation of the right lower limb due to ischaemia in May 2011. Chronic treatment with: bisoprolol, nifedipine, omeprazole, acetylsalicylic acid and candesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. Urological history: after amputation of the right lower limb, he suffered several episodes of urinary tract infections treated with antibiotics and a single positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, only sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. Several episodes of self-limited haematuria in the last 4 months, with normal haemogram and serum biochemistry.
The patient attended the emergency department (14/10/2011) due to deterioration of general condition, diffuse abdominal pain and macroscopic haematuria of weeks of evolution. He did not present fever, nausea or micturition syndrome.

Physical examination
Conscious, eupneic and afebrile, with marked cutaneous-mucosal pallor. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Blood pressure 104/51 mmHg. Heart rate 65 bpm. Abdomen soft, non-painful, with negative bilateral fist percussion. External genitalia normal. Rectal examination: fibroelastic prostate, II/IV, mobile, non-painful.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests (on arrival at the ED): haemoglobin 4.6 g/dl, haematocrit 14.4%, 452,000 platelets/mm3, 10,080 leukocytes/mm3 (neutrophils 79.2%). Prothrombin time 62%, glucose 100 mg/dl, urea 284 mg/dl, creatinine 8.97 mg/dl, Na+ 137 mEq/l, K+ 7.2 mEq/l.
- Urine: density 1.015; pH 8. Sediment with macroscopic haematuria and microleucocyturia.
- Urine culture: Klebsiella pneumoniae, only resistant to ampicillin.
- Abdominal ultrasound: atrophic right kidney (5.6 cm long axis). Left kidney with occupation of the pyelo-infundibulo-calyceal system by hyperechogenic images leaving a posterior acoustic shadow, compatible with lithiasis. No dilatation of the excretory systems or lithiasis in the ureteral tract. Bladder not assessable. Prostate 60 cc. The rest of the abdominal structures were normal.
- Abdominal CT scan without contrast: atrophic right kidney. Left kidney of normal size with mild ectasia of the excretory system, showing a thickened wall with calcification of the mucosal surface in practically its entire course, of a non-specific nature. Fighting bladder, with calcification of the mucosa on the posterior wall. Right pleural effusion.

Diagnosis
Encrusted pyelitis in a single functioning kidney due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Treatment and evolution
On arrival, red blood cell transfusion, haemodialysis and bladder catheterisation are performed. The haematuria varied in intensity over the days, without ever disappearing. Antibiotic treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam (2/0.5 g every 8 h), based on previous urine culture and ascorbic acid (500 mg/8 h) to acidify the urine due to a urinary pH of 9, but was discontinued after 48 hours due to metabolic acidosis. After several haemodialysis sessions and transfusions, renal function progressively deteriorated, despite a daily diuresis of 1,500 cc. On the twelfth day of admission, he presented with atrial fibrillation, heart failure and chest pain with myocardial damage. The patient and his family refused more aggressive treatment and he died 15 days after admission.
