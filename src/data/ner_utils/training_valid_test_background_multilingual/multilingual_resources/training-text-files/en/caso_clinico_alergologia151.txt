A 12-year-old boy with a history of rhinoconjunctivitis due to allergic sensitisation to spring pollens, subclinical sensitisation to LTP, and atopic dermatitis who presented 30 minutes after ingesting eucalyptus and menthol sweets: dyspnoea, pruritus and generalised wheals accompanied by erythema and facial angioedema which subsided with oral antihistamines. Six months earlier, he had a similar immediate episode with eucalyptus chewing gum, resolved in the emergency department with intravenous treatment. On examination: total IgE: 500kU/L. Prick by prick with eucalyptus, peppermint and peppermint leaves: weak positive/controls negative. Perioral test with caramel: negative. Slow oral challenge with candy involved, presenting 60 minutes after testing the whole candy: generalised wheals, genital itching and nasal congestion. It resolved after prescribing dexchlorpheniramine, methylprednisolone and adrenaline according to weight. The use of the allergens involved was prohibited.

- We present a very rare case of anaphylaxis following ingestion of eucalyptus and menthol candy in a paediatric patient.

- Given the allergological results, we can assume that an IgE-mediated mechanism was responsible for the reaction presented by the patient.
