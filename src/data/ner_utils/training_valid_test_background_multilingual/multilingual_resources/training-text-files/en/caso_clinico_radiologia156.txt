27-year-old male from Peru, brought from the airport due to low level of consciousness. No relevant PA. He reported having landed four days ago, since then, confused, waiting for relatives. He reported general malaise and weight loss for two months and new reddish pruritic skin lesions on the arm. Temperature in the ED 37.9Â°.

INITIAL IMAGING FINDINGS
Morphological alteration in the frontal horn, collapsed, and increased density in the head and body of the caudate. Discrete mass effect in the base ganglia. The study was completed with IV contrast after 5 minutes. A marked subependymal enhancement is confirmed, around the ventricular system, more extensive in the frontal horn, lateral ventricular bodies and to a lesser extent occipital. Enhancement in the basal ganglia, particularly the right caudate. The following are proposed as diagnostic options: cerebral lymphoma, CMV/toxoplasma type inflammatory pathology or primary HIV involvement.
