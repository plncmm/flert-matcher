A 17-year-old woman from the town of Pozo Azul (San Pedro), who suffered the accident in May 2014 when she was picking mandarins. Approximately 24 hours after the accident, she arrived at the hospital lucid, reporting pain and burning at the site of injury (stinging dermatitis) and arthralgia in the lower limbs. Physical examination revealed the presence of oedema in the region of the left knee, which was later confirmed with an ultrasound scan that suggested haemarthrosis. Laboratory examination showed AP 20% and KPTT > 180 seconds. Complementary laboratory tests showed: red blood cells 4 050 000/mm3; leukocytes 12 500/mm3; platelets 256 000/mm3; haematocrit 34%; haemoglobin 11.3 g/dl. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed the presence of abundant red blood cells per field (haematuria). At the Laboratory of Entomology and Taxonomy of the INMeT (Argentina), the specimens of the causative animal brought by the patient at the time of consultation were identified as larvae of L. obliqua, and a diagnosis of Lonomia erucism was made. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and received specific treatment a few hours after admission. She was treated with supportive measures, receiving regular corticosteroids (hydrocortisone), antibiotics (ceftriaxone), antihistamines (diphenhydramine), anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, ketorolac) and vitamin K. The day after admission, the following laboratory results were obtained: red blood cells 3 330 000/mm3; leukocytes 17 100/mm3; platelets 208 000/mm3; haematocrit 30%; haemoglobin 9.6 g/dl; AP 60% and KPTT 30 seconds. Ultrasound scanning of the left knee showed moderate/abundant fluid at the level of the joint associated with haemarthrosis. The patient remained in hospital for 5 days, during which time clinical and laboratory parameters normalised.
