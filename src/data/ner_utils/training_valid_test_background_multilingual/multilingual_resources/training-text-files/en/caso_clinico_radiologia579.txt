A 47-year-old woman consulted the emergency department for asthenia, headache and altered level of consciousness in the last few days. The haemogram revealed 120,240 leucocytes (N 0% and L 39.4%), Hb: 5.6, Hct: 15.5, and platelets: 23000. Based on these data and the blood smear, the patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL3). On physical examination, the patient was disoriented and drowsy, so a simple CT scan of the skull was performed.

The cranial CT scan showed: - multiple hyperdense cortical and subcortical lesions, the largest in the cerebellum and left temporal lobe, compatible with parenchymal haemorrhages, with subarachnoid extension, - two right parietal and occipital cortico-subcortical hypodense lesions with mass effect and effacement of sulci, suggestive of infarcts. These findings may be due to cerebral involvement by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Another possibility is angioinvasive aspergillosis.
