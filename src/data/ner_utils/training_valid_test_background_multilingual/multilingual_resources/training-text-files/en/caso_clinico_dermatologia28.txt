Clinical history
A 35-year-old woman, with no personal history of interest, consulted for the appearance of a skin lesion on the abdomen that had been present for 8 months. The lesion was asymptomatic and had not changed.

Physical examination
Erythematous papule with a whitish halo, 1 Ã— 0.5 cm in diameter, located on the left abdomen.

Histopathology
The biopsy showed a dermal proliferation of small, uniform, branching, branching, collapsed-looking vessels with scant lumina and prominent endothelial cells. No cytological atypia or mitosis figures were observed. Immunohistochemistry for herpes virus type 8 was negative.


Additional tests
Dermoscopy revealed a diffuse central erythema with desquamation and delicate pigmented reticulum in the periphery.

Diagnosis
Microvenular haemangioma.

Evolution and treatment
The lesion was completely excised by excision-biopsy at the first visit and no further treatment was required.
