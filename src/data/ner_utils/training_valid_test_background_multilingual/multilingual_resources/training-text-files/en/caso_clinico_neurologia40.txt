Anamnesis
A 75 year old woman, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia under treatment, was admitted from the Emergency Department to the Neurology Department for vertigo and diplopia. It began abruptly and at rest, with dizziness described as vertigo with spinning of objects, intense and disabling, accompanied by vegetative symptoms and hearing loss in the right ear, with no other added symptoms. She was assessed by her primary care physician, who indicated symptomatic treatment, without benefit. A week later, she visited the emergency department again due to persistent symptoms and the appearance of vesicles in the right ear, and was assessed with the diagnostic impression of right herpes zoster oticus and treatment with sulpiride and valacyclovir was indicated. After 8 days, the patient reported horizontal binocular diplopia, with no improvement in her previous symptoms. An ophthalmological assessment revealed paresis of the right fourth cranial nerve. A basic general blood test was performed (11,888 leukocytes/mm3, neutrophils 82%, no other alterations), a cranial and orbital computerised tomography (CT) scan (with no notable findings) and it was decided to admit her to the Neurology Department to complete the study. The patient had no fever or previous systemic infectious symptoms, and did not present TBI or other symptoms in the rest of the anamnesis.

Physical examination
General examination: good general condition. Of note: slight dehydration. Right external auditory canal (EAC) with multiple herpetic vesicles. Neurological examination. Cortical functions: good level of consciousness. Orientation in the three spheres. Coherent verbal language without dysphasic elements or dysarthria. No visuospatial hemineglect. No sensory or visual extinction. Cranial nerves: isochoric pupils, photomotor and consensual reflexes preserved. Normal confrontational campimetry. Primary gaze with tendency to abduction of the left eye, left eye adduction paresis without palpebral ptosis. Horizontal nystagmus in the extreme right horizontal gaze. Sensory and motor V cranial nerve without alterations. No asymmetry or facial weakness. Right hearing loss. Weber test lateralised to the left. Rhinne's test positive bilaterally. Lower cranial nerves without alterations. Motor system: no claudication in anti-gravity manoeuvres. Normal muscle strength, 5/5 by muscle groups. Normal tone and trophism. REM ++/++++ symmetrical bilaterally, without pathological responses. Bilateral skin-plantar flexor reflex. Sensibilities: preserved in all modalities. Balance, coordination and gait: no cerebellar signs. Standing and walking not explorable due to the patient's active vertiginous symptoms. No meningeal signs.

Complementary tests
- General laboratory tests: complete blood count, basic coagulation, complete biochemistry, enzymes, ions, lipid profile, thyroid profile, vitamin B12 and folic acid normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 6 mm/h.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): normal opening pressure. Glucose 55 mg/dl (40-70 mg/dl), total protein 23.40 mg/dl (less than 40 mg/dl). Cellularity: 40 leukocytes/mm3, predominantly MN (90%), 0 red blood cells/mm3.
- Pathology: benign cytology. Smear with mononuclear lymphocytic pleocytosis.
- Microbiology: negative culture in standard media for bacteria. Virological study: herpes zoster, herpes simplex 1 and 2 and enterovirus negative.
- Chest X-ray: no alterations.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast: replacement of the normal CSF of the fundus of the right internal auditory canal (IAC) by hypointense material in T2, which shows intense enhancement after administering gadolinium. It also shows enhancement of the cochlea (mainly basal and medial loops), the vestibule and the entire facial nerve canal (labyrinthine, anterior knee, tympanic, posterior knee and mastoid segments). The findings are compatible with an inflammatory process, affecting the right facial and vestibulo-cochlear nerves. There was no evidence of meningeal enhancement.
- Control brain MRI (15 days later): radiological stability with respect to the previous MRI, showing inflammatory changes affecting the right cranial nerves VII and VIII.
- Tone audiometry: moderate hypoacusis in low and middle tones in the right ear with a symmetrical drop in high tones. Left ear: normoacusis.

Diagnosis
Right herpes zoster oticus with inflammatory polyneuritic involvement of the right VIII cranial nerve (vestibular and cochlear branches), the left III cranial nerve and probably the right IV cranial nerve.

Treatment
General measures: rest, hydration, antiemetics. Treatment with: intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg/day, 3 times a day for 15 days; diazepam, 5 mg every 8 hours, and intravenous sulpiride, 100 mg every 8 hours.

Evolution
Admission was marked by significant vertiginous symptoms, right hearing loss, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, as well as diplopia, which slowly improved progressively. One month later, only horizontal diplopia persisted in the extreme left gaze with horizontal-rotatory nystagmus in supralevoversion, hypoacusis and unstable gait with a tendency to right lateropulsion. She was assessed in the Otorhinolaryngology Department, and caloric and VNG tests were performed, which showed a 100% right vestibular deficit. Her hearing loss and AT remain stable.
