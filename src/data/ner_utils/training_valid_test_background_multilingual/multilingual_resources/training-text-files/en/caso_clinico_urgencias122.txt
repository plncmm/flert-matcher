Reason for consultation: 74-year-old man, without AFC, who consulted for colicky abdominal pain, epigastric, of 24 hours' evolution, radiating to the left flank, with the appearance of fever and chills, without micturition syndrome. Pathological history: Ex-smoker, AHT, DM-II (poorly controlled and with secondary retinopathy) and LBP. Severe multifactorial vasculopathy with renal involvement (stage III, under treatment with erythropoietin). HIV/AIDS infection (sexually transmitted infection) of 18 years of evolution; multiple lines of treatment due to failures and poor tolerance; currently treated with EFV+ATV, with undetectable viral load and CD4 of 147 (21%); 'non-repopulating' profile. TB in adolescence. ACxFA treated with anticoagulation and beta-blocker. Multiple repeat TIAs. Carrier of bicameral pacemaker due to complete AVB. Chronic ischaemic heart disease of long evolution; double aorto-coronary bypass (1993); PTCA on 3 occasions with 6 stents; EF of 25% with dilated cardiomyopathy and infero-posterior akinesia; secondary heart failure NYHA-II/III functional class. EF.TA 152/55; FC 88x"; FR 20X"; Ta 38.4oC; basal O2 Sat 93%; GCS 15/15. AC: CRT, no murmurs/rhythmias; no signs of CHF, well perfused. AR: VCM, no added sounds. NRL: conscious and oriented, no acute focality. ABD: soft and depressible, with defence in the left hypochondrium, without ascites. Skin: general condition: fair, normal colour and normal hydration. Complementary tests. CBC: Hb 12.9, Ht. 37%. 136,000 platelets. 15,410 leukocytes (10% bands). PCR 195; pro-calcitonin 15.1. Biochemistry: glucose 388, Cr 1.7; ionogram, normal; total bilirubin 1.3 (direct 0.4), AST 25.8, ALT 12.6, GGT 81, FA 127, amylase 195, lipase 60, CK 17.4. INR 2.8, Quick 28%. Troponin-T 0.01. ECG: ACxFA with FVM of 90x", without signs of acute myocardial ischaemia. Urine study: 0 leucocytes/field, 0 haemocytes/field; amylasuria 618. Abdominal CT (sc): biliary tract normal; pancreas within normality; image suggestive of splenic infarction. Abdominal ultrasound: spleen with a geographical hypoechoic involvement of about 5 cm in the lower pole with absence of vascularisation, compatible with infarction; the rest of the examination was normal. Transesophageal echocardiogram: no images suggestive of endocarditis were observed in valves or in the pacemaker implantation electrode. Blood cultures (2, pre-antibiotic treatment): at 72 h, Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated in 2/2 bottles, with sensitivity < 0.25 to ciprofloxacin. Evolution: Under initial diagnostic guidance of possible acute pancreatitis (not related to antiretrovirals), after extraction of 2 blood cultures, antibiotic coverage with parenteral imipenem was initiated. A differential diagnosis with mesenteric ischaemia and biliary tract pathology was also considered. Subsequently, imaging tests showed splenic infarction and given the blood culture result (positive for Klebsiella oxytoca in a patient with HIV/AIDS), it was attributed to infectious aetiology (and not emboligenic due to atrial fibrillation). He was admitted to the ward, ruling out the biliary tract, colon and endocarditis as the infectious focus, completing antibiotic treatment for 15 days (initially with carbapenemics and later with quinolones). Diagnostic hypothesis. Splenic infarction of probable septic origin (unfiliated focus) in a patient who was immobile due to HIV/AIDS.
