EVOLUTION
Given the history of anatomical asplenia and fever, a complete blood count, biochemistry, coagulation, arterial blood gases, urinalysis, chest X-ray, ECG and blood cultures were requested. Treatment was started with 2 g ev of ceftriaxone, fluids were also administered and 50 mg of dexketoprofen for treatment of fever, arthromyalgia and malaise. After a favourable evolution in the Emergency Department Observation and normal results of the complementary examinations, it was decided to admit her to the Short Stay Unit for evolutionary control. Anecdotally, the patient was reluctant to be admitted, it was explained to her that it was a 12-24 hour admission, barring complications, due to her history of splenectomy, she insisted that her spleen had been removed "the year Franco died", that since then she had suffered numerous febrile processes and she had never been admitted nor had she been told of the risks involved in having this organ removed. In the end, with the help and understanding of her family, the patient consented without any problem. She was admitted to the Short Stay Unit with the following recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Admission to the SSU: Low sodium diet. Monitoring of vital signs every 8 hours. Physiological saline solution 1,500 ml x 24 hours. Control of diuresis. Ceftriaxone 2 g ev. every 12 hours. Paracetamol 1 g every 8 hours, if fever. Analytical control for 8 hours the following day. DEVELOPMENT in the SSU: A warning was given at 23:00 hours of the same day (approximately 5 hours after admission to the SSU) due to hypotension, and repeated loads of physiological saline solution were perfused without managing to raise the BP. The patient was placed in the Critical Care Unit, a new blood test was requested and blood cultures were taken. Highlights: Leukocytes * 11.97 x10^3/μL Neutrophils % * 94.1 % Total neutrophils * 11.28 x10^3 Platelets ** 10 x10^3/μL Creatinine * 1.40 mg/dL Urea * 52 mg/dL Ac.

Arterial blood gases: pH * 7.33 pCO2 32 mmHg HCO3 * 17 mmol/L ABE-BE * -8 mmol/L SBE * -8 mmol/L O2 saturation 98 % Antigenuria positive for Pneumococcus.
A second antibiotic is added, levofloxacin 500 mg ev every 12 hours, fluid perfusion, bladder catheter and hourly diuresis control. Drum is channelled for PVC control. Confirmation of plateletopenia was requested and confirmed (platelets 7,000, with citrate tube), 2 platelet pools were requested. After administration of successive loads of fluids without achieving haemodynamic stability, vasoactive drugs are started in ev perfusion and the patient is transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. 

Diagnosis:
Septic shock due to pneumococcal bacteraemia with probable respiratory focus and multi-organ dysfunction (haemodynamic, respiratory, renal, haematological, hepatic, coagulopathy). In the ICU, the patient presented poor evolution, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, perfusion of vasoactive drugs at increasing doses, continuous venovenous haemofiltration, severe DIC, refractory plateletopenia. On day 16 of admission: Aspergillus niger pneumonia, evolution to invasive aspergillosis Progressive worsening, exits on day 40 of admission.
