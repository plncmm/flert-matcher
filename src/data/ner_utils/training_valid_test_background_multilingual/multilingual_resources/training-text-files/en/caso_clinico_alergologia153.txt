A 28-month-old boy came to our clinic in 2012 for episodes of erythema and facial oedema with occasional vomiting related to the ingestion of pulses, fish, carrots and rice with prawns. The initial allergological study showed positive skin tests for all fish, all pulses, carrots, mussels and shrimp with positive specific IgE to these foods, which led to an initial diagnosis of allergy to pulses, fish, shellfish and carrots. At the medical check-up 3 months after diagnosis, the patient had reactions to tomato, soya, pumpkin, green and red pepper and herbs for the broth, showing positive reactions to all these foods in the skin tests and also to all vegetables except cabbage and potato in vivo and in vitro. Positive panallergen skin tests to LTP, profilin and polcalcin. The ImmunoCAP ISAC112 study shows a patient with polysensitisation to species-specific allergens and cross-reactive allergens. Treatment with omalizumab was started in August 2013. In May 2014, it was found that the skin tests for vegetables and squid were negative. Good oral tolerance was observed with raw tomato with skin and carrot in September 2014, with squid in April 2015, with almonds in May 2015 and with peas in July 2015.
