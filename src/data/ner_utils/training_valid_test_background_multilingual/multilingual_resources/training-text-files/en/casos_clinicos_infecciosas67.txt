33-year-old woman. No known medical history.

She consulted for pruritus of the foot associated with erythematous-edematous lesions. No fever, odynophagia or respiratory symptoms. After 72 hours the patient developed an erythematous-violaceous plaque similar to perniosis.

Laboratory results: normal haemogram without lymphopenia, negative FAN, negative lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipins. Serology for SARS-CoV-2: IgM positive and IgG negative. PCR was not performed as she did not meet the epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. She is currently in home isolation.

This type of skin manifestations of COVID-19, known as "Covid Toe", are often late. Clinically, they resemble chilblains that occur on the extremities as an inflammatory response to low temperatures. The differential diagnosis in this young patient with vasculitis phenomena is lupus pernio or antiphospholipid syndrome.
