Anamnesis
A 66 year old patient, with no personal history of interest, came to the Emergency Department with a picture of oppressive headache, frontal localisation and sudden onset, not accompanied by neurological focality, nausea or vomiting. She also reported no fever or systemic symptoms.

Physical examination
On arrival at the Emergency Department, the patient had a good level of consciousness, was coherent in her relationship with her surroundings, obeyed orders and spontaneous language was normal. The rest of the neurological examination showed no focality. During her stay in the emergency department, the patient suffered an abrupt deterioration in her level of consciousness, with fluctuations in her level of consciousness. At that time, the neurological examination showed a tendency to sleep with bradypsychia, the cranial pairs were normal including the fundus, she had a left hemiparesis of brachial predominance with exalted musculoskeletal reflexes in the left hemibody and left Babinsky. There were no spontaneous limb movements.

Complementary tests
- General laboratory test with no findings. Urine study with no findings.
- Chest X-ray: no findings.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): intraparenchymal haematoma in the posterior region of the right parietal lobe, measuring 54 x 27 x 50 mm, in its anteroposterior, transverse and craniocaudal axes, respectively, with peripheral oedema. In the posterior region of the left parietal lobe there is another intraparenchymal haematoma measuring 30 x 24 x 27 mm. Adjacent to the cerebral sickle on its left side there is another haematoma measuring 36 x 16 x 20 mm. Widespread suture effacement and lack of differentiation between white/gray matter, related to diffuse cerebral oedema. Subdural haematoma in the midline, left tentorium.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): superficial lobular haematomas with extension to the white matter and/or subarachnoid, multiple in both parietal lobes, parasagittal region, occipital circumvolution of the left cerebral hemisphere. Intraventricular haemorrhage in both lateral ventricles and subarachnoid haemorrhage.
- HIV serology, hepatotropic viruses: negative. Neurotropic serology: negative. Rheumatoid factor: negative. C3 and C4 normal. Autoimmunity study: negative. Cerebrospinal fluid: normal cytobiochemistry. No intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G. Oligoclonal bands in serum and cerebrospinal fluid: negative. Cerebrospinal fluid culture: negative.
- Arteriography of the brain: irregularity and dissection of a short segment of C1 of the right internal carotid artery, and stenosis of the C1 segment of the left internal carotid artery, with normal renal arteries. Generalised thinning of the intracranial vessels with alternating areas of mild reduction in calibre, which may be related to cerebral vasculitis.
- Meningeal biopsy: no alterations.
- Biopsy of the brain parenchyma: sections of several fragments of brain tissue with marked involvement of small blood vessels at the expense of the presence of neutrophilic leukocytes, at peri and intraparietal level, alternating with occasional phenomena of fibrinohaematic thromboembolism and parietovascular destruction. Peripherally, lymphocytic and histiocytic elements are seen both adventitially and at the level of the brain parenchyma, alternating in the latter with vacuolar degeneration and frequent small haemorrhagic foci, as well as reactive gliosis. There is no evidence of pathogens or granulomatous formations. Compatible with vasculitis.

Diagnosis
As a syndromic diagnosis the patient presented with an encephalopathic picture together with a right hemispheric syndrome, caused by multiple intracranial haemorrhages secondary to a primary vasculitis of the central nervous system.  Treatment Treatment was started with boluses of methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g daily for 3 days and then 0.5 g for 2 more days, with the intention of adding cyclophosphamide if there was no improvement.

Evolution
Despite the treatment, the patient showed a torpid evolution, with progressive intracranial hypertension, and the control CT scan showed new haemorrhagic foci in the occipital lobes and increased cerebral oedema. The intracranial hypertension became refractory to treatment, definitively leading to the patient's death.
