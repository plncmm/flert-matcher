Male, 39 years old, of Bolivian origin, resident in Jerez for 5 years, construction worker. No toxic habits, allergies or recent trips abroad. History of seborrhoeic dermatitis on the scalp. No contact with animals in recent months. She visited her primary care doctor for fever (38-39 oC), chills, some vomiting and a painful lump in the right armpit. Despite this, the fever continued, increasing the pain and the size of the lump, so 4 days later she went to the emergency department, where outpatient treatment with Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg every 12 hours was recommended. Despite this, he continued to have fever and the axillary tumour grew and became more painful, so he returned to the emergency department where it was decided to admit him.
The patient was in fair general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Good hydration of skin and mucous membranes. Normotensive. Well perfused. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was strictly normal. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation; no palpable visceral growths. In the right axilla there was a painful tumour on palpation, ovoid in shape with a maximum diameter of 4 cm and signs of phlogosis in the adjacent skin. The lower extremities were normal. Laboratory tests on admission showed a normal haemogram and coagulation study. Biochemical tests were normal except for a CRP of 28.87 mg/dl (normal < 0.5 mg/dl).
Serology for HBV, HCV, HAV, Coxiella burnetti, Toxoplasma, Rickettsia, lupus, HIV, EBV and rubella were negative, as were blood cultures at peak fever. Soft tissue ultrasound of the axillary region showed a 4 cm polylobulated collection in the right axilla, with other adjacent rounded, very hypoechogenic images, some of which preserved a fatty hilum. Impression: complicated hydrosadenitis.

Evolution
With the findings of the examination and complementary tests, the patient started antibiotic treatment with intravenous cloxacillin + ceftriaxone and underwent surgery to drain the axillary collection seen in the ultrasound scan. A superficial incision was made which revealed a deep tumour suggesting a large axillary adenopathy, so no procedure was performed at that time, and the surgeon suggested that it was advisable to complete the study of the patient. After the operation, the patient continued to have a high fever and intense pain in the right axilla, despite antibiotic treatment. In view of this evolution, it was decided to perform a thoraco-abdominal CT scan, which was normal, except for the presence of a space-occupying lesion in the right axilla, measuring 5 x 3.5 cm, with blurred external borders. It had hypodense areas inside and after contrast injection showed peripheral contrast uptake. Radiological diagnosis: abscessed lymphadenopathy, without ruling out other underlying pathology. There were also multiple other small adenopathies adjacent to the main one. In view of these data, it was decided to perform an aspiration puncture of the lesion, obtaining purulent material. Two days later the tumour fustulised and drained spontaneously.

Differential diagnosis
With the syndromic diagnosis of suppurative axillary lymphadenopathy, the following diagnostic possibilities were considered:
- Pyogenic axillary abscess: generally secondary to hydrosadenitis, the germ most commonly associated with this process being S.aureus followed by S.pyogenes.
- Mycobacterial infection. As is well known, M. tuberculosis is the causative agent of lymphadenopathy, up to 10% of which are suppurative. M. avium and M. scrofulaceum can also cause lymphadenitis, with abscessification and spontaneous suppuration being frequent in the latter case.
- Yersinia pestis should be considered, but it is not endemic in our environment and although the patient was Bolivian, he had not travelled outside Spain.
- Francisella tularensis, Bartonella henselae and Sporothrixs chenckii are microorganisms that can cause this type of symptoms, the first two being associated with contact with animals. On questioning, the patient reported that his son had had a cat puppy three months previously, and that the whole family had been scratched by it.
- Chlamydia trachomatis is another possible cause of suppurative adenopathy, particularly in the inguinal region. The patient strongly denied having had any risky sexual contacts.
- Hodgkin's lymphoma produces fistulised lymphadenopathy in up to 2 % of cases (nodular sclerosis variety), so in a young patient with prolonged fever and this type of lymphadenopathy should also be considered.
- Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease usually occurs in young people with fever without apparent focus and causes lymphadenopathy, which may be suppurative.

Evolution
Empirical treatment was started with Clarithromycin 500 mg, one tablet every 12 hours with adequate tolerance. In the following days the evolution was adequate, fissuring and draining spontaneously. Antibiotic treatment was maintained for 14 days with disappearance of all symptoms. At subsequent check-ups the patient remained asymptomatic and with no new signs or symptoms.

Final diagnosis
The results of microbiology and pathology of the pus from the adenopathy were received. Cytology was inflammatory, while cultures on bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial media were negative. Given the clinical suspicion, a PCR for Bartonella henselae was performed and was positive. Based on these data, a final diagnosis of cat scratch disease was made. The patient received oral treatment with azithromycin 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg on the following four days. After 48 hours he was asymptomatic and was discharged.
