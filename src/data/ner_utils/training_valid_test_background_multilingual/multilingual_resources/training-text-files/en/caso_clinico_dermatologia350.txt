Anamnesis
A 53-year-old man, with no drug allergies and no personal history of interest. He consulted for a rapidly growing plaque on the right forearm of 2 weeks' evolution. He works as a seasonal worker harvesting olives. He reported no previous trauma to the area, nor had he ever shaved his forearms.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed a large (11 cm x 6 cm) keloid-like scaly plaque on the middle third of the right forearm with well-defined borders and a warty surface.

Complementary examinations
The exudate from the plaque was cultured and investigated for fungi, with negative results. A punch biopsy and culture of the deep aspirate were also performed. The pathology study showed a granulomatous response in the pilosebaceous follicle and dermal abscesses. Gomori methenamine-arginine staining of the specimen showed oval arthrospores within the hair shaft, with an endothrix capillary invasion pattern.
A deep aspiration sample identified the fungus Tricophyton rubrum.
Complementary analytical tests to assess the immunological status (HIV serology, T-helper/T-suppressor ratio, T-lymphocytes/T-suppressor ratio) were performed.
T-helpers/T-suppressors and chest X-ray) were normal.

Diagnosis
Majocchi granuloma.

Treatment and evolution
The patient is treated with itraconazole 400 mg every 12 hours, with excellent response at 8 weeks.
