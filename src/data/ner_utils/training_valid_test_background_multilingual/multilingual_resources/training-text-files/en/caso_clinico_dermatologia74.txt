A 14-year-old female patient diagnosed with McCune-Albright syndrome, with hyperprolactinaemia, hypothyroidism and impaired growth hormone secretion, on treatment with octreotide, levothyroxine, disodium pamidronate and cabergoline, referred for evaluation of the presence of macules on the lower limbs, of 2 years' evolution.
Physical examination revealed brownish macular lesions of irregular configuration, with some telangiectasias predominantly on the left foot and ankle, and pruritic purpuric punctation on both feet and the pretibial region. In addition, a coffee-with-milk coloured macule was observed on the nape of the neck and interscapular region, measuring approximately 3 cm by 10 cm, with sharp and irregular edges, facial asymmetry, prognathism and inability to ambulate.
Routine laboratory tests were requested and were normal. The lesions still persist.
