A 13-year-old female patient with allergy to rosaceous fruits and hazelnut (LTP) and contact dermatitis due to colophony, who presented 15 to 20 minutes after administration of MULTIHANCE contrast medium (dimeglumine gadobenate) with dyspnoea, inspiratory stridor, eyelid oedema, ocular reddening, nasal pruritus and generalised urticaria, treated with oral corticoids and antihistamines, which subsided completely in 2 to 3 hours.

Allergological study performed (7 months after the event): Prick test with dimeglumine gadobenate and gadodiamide (undiluted): Negative. Intradermal reaction negative with gadodiamide at 1/100 and 1/10.

With dimeglumine gadobenate at 1/100, 2 mm papule enlargement and erythema; and at 1/10, positive result with 18 mm erythema and 6 mm papule enlargement.

Enlargement of the study:
Negative skin prick test and intradermal reaction to gadoteridol, gadoteric acid, gadoxetate and gadobutrol. Provocations up to recommended doses (0.1 mmol/kilo of body weight), gadodiamide and gadobutrol were negative.

We present a case of anaphylaxis to dimeglumine gadobenate in paediatric age documented with a positive skin test. To our knowledge there is only one reported case in paediatric age of allergic reaction (without anaphylaxis) to gadolinium-based contrast medium (gadoteridol). Tolerance to other GCBMs is checked to rule out cross-reactivity and to offer safe alternatives to the patient.
