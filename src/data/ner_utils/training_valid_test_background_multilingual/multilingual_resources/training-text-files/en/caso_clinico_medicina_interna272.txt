A 33-year-old woman diagnosed in February 2015 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia BII Ph negative due to febrile syndrome and purpuric lesions on the lower limbs. The blood test showed 21,000 leukocytes (35% blasts of lymphoid appearance), haemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL and 22,000 platelets. The patient received chemotherapy treatment with pre-phase, induction, early and late consolidation. Despite this, she had an early molecular relapse and further morphological relapse, so salvage treatment was performed to induce a complete remission in view of an allo-HPTT. During the period of neutropenia the patient received antibiotic, antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis with levoxacin 500mg/day by mouth, ceftriaxone 1g/24h ev, fluconazole 400mg/day by mouth, inhaled pentamidine 300mcg every 28 days and acyclovir 400mg every 8h by mouth.
Twenty days after the rescue treatment, the patient developed fever with no apparent focus. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia with 200 leukocytes (100 neutrophils), haemoglobin 10.7 g/dL and 25,000 platelets. CRP 2.97 mg/dL, creatinine 0.52 mg/dL, ASAT/ALAT 15/26 U/L, GGT/FA 121/145 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, LDH 145 U/L, sodium 141 mEq/L and potassium 3.8 mEq/L. With a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia, cultures were taken and meropenem and vancomycin were started. On the fifth day of fever, the patient developed respiratory symptoms and a CAT scan was performed, which revealed alveolar condensation in the left upper lobe (LSI) with bronchial obstruction and a peripheral halo in ground glass. Fibrobronchoscopy showed inflammation of the LSI bronchus with partial occlusion of the bronchus. Bronchial aspirate isolated Aspergillus fumigatus colonies and voriconazole was started. Serum galactomannan detection was negative. Despite treatment, the patient remained febrile, with respiratory symptoms and added chest pain. A second fibrobronchoscopy was performed, showing a complete narrowing of the lumen of the LSI, from which biopsies were taken and hyphae compatible with mucor were observed. Gene detection was performed and was positive for Rhizopus arrizus. Liposomal amphotericin and posaconazole were started.
