A 25-year-old man, otherwise healthy, presented with a one-day evolution of headache, left paresthesia and ipsilateral paresthesia which, in 12 hours, evolved into disorientation and restlessness. His axillary temperature was 38.2 °C. Brain CT and MRI scans were normal. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and proteinorrachia. Treatment was started with acivlovir, ampicillin and i.v. ceftriaxone, which was discontinued when PCR and CSF cultures ruled out bacterial or viral aetiologies. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative in CSF but positive in nasopharyngeal swab. On day 2, the patient recovered completely except for amnesia of the previous 2 days.
