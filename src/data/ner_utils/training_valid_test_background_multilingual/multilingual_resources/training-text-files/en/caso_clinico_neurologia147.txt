Anamnesis
A 52-year-old man from Paraguay (resident in Spain for the last 7 years), smoker of approximately 3-4 cigarettes a day and with a personal history of arterial hypertension of several years of evolution with regular control. He denies other toxic habits and has no other vascular risk factors. He is independent for basic activities of daily living and works in the construction sector. He is not currently following any regular treatment.

The patient came to the emergency department because, having been previously asymptomatic, on 6/6/2013 he woke up with a feeling of dizziness, gait instability and temporospatial disorientation. He had no other symptoms of motor focality and also reported no headache, fever or previous infectious symptoms. On arrival at the ED, the patient's blood pressure was 216/136 mmHg.

Physical examination
Good general condition. Two pigmented skin plaques in the left pretibial region. The rest of the general examination was unaltered. Neurological examination: conscious and disoriented in time and space. Language: diminished fluency, occasional altered nomination, normal repetition and comprehension. No dysarthria. Cranial nerves normal. Motor system: tone and trophism preserved. Muscle balance (BM) 4+/5 in the right lower limb (in the rest of the limbs BM 5/5). Sensibility preserved and symmetrical. Osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical. Bilateral cutaneous-plantar flexor reflex. No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Score on the NIHSS scale 0 points.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory data: normal haemogram, coagulation and biochemistry.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): total protein 844 mg/dl (75-320), normal glycorrhachia, neurospecific enolase 52.2 ng/ml (0.5-8.5), myelin basic protein 6.6 ng/ml (0.1-1.5). Syphilis IgG serology positive (VDRL negative, PCR negative). Other serologies (Cysticercus, HIV, brucellosis, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus) negative.
- Serum microbiology: serology syphilis IgG positive, RPR positive 1⁄4⁄4; TPPA positive. Other serologies (Cysticercus, Brucella, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, histoplasma) negative.
- Brain computed tomography (CT) scan on admission (7/3/2013): cerebral haemorrhage in the thalamus and posterior arm of the internal capsule, measuring approximately 19 x 36 mm with mass effect and midline shift of 3.7 mm. Brain CT scan performed on patient's admission showing left thalamo-capsular haemorrhage. 1B. Brain CT scan performed 26 days after admission showing resolution of the haemorrhage and the appearance of hypodense lesions in the bihemispheric white matter.
- CT scan of the brain (3/4/2013): left thalamic haemorrhage resolving. Hypodense lesions in the periventricular white matter and semioval centres.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain (12/4/2013): left posterior thalamic haemorrhagic lesion. Small hyperintense foci in T2 and FLAIR in the white matter, without oedema or mass effect. These lesions do not show uptake after contrast administration.
- Cerebral arteriography (6/5/2013): discrete isolated segmental irregularities in the branches of both pericallosal arteries of the right posterior frontal convexity, and somewhat more evident also of a branch of the left pericallosal artery at the left parasagittal parietal level.
Axial FLAIR sequence of the brain MRI showing multiple subcortical bihemispheric hyperintense lesions of probable ischaemic aetiology. Cerebral arteriography of the patient showing discrete segmental irregularities in the branches of the pericallosal artery.

Diagnosis
Left cerebral thalamo-capsular haemorrhage secondary to arterial hypertension. White matter lesions of probable ischaemic aetiology. Possible infectious arteriopathy. Tertiary syphilis with central nervous system involvement (probable meningovascular syphilis). Subcortical dementia of multifactorial aetiology (vascular and infectious).

Treatment
The patient was admitted to the Stroke Unit, where anti-edema and anti-hypertensive therapy was started, although blood pressure figures remained poorly controlled, so he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where control of blood pressure was achieved, During his stay in the ICU, he presented complications such as sepsis secondary to tracheobronchitis due to Acinetobacter baumanii, resolved after antibiotic treatment, and pulmonary thromboembolism requiring the implantation of a vena cava filter.

Evolution
From the neurological point of view, the patient developed subcortical cognitive impairment with marked attentional and executive function deficits. (Mini Mental State Exaination [MMSE] score of 16/30), a mild paresis persists in the right lower limb (BM 4+/5) and a nominative aphasia with frequent paraphasias. Positive syphilis serologies were detected in blood and CSF (possibly artefacts of a previous course of antibiotics), and treatment with penicillin was started for 14 days. A brain CT scan performed on the ward showed multiple subcortical hypodense lesions that had not appeared on previous scans, so the differential diagnosis of these lesions was considered to be more likely due to an infectious or ischaemic cause. The patient evolved favourably, with an MMSE score of 25/30 after completing treatment with penicillin.
