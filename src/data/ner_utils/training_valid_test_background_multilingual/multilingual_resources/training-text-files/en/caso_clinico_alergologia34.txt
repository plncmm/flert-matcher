10-year-old girl diagnosed in another centre with nut allergy after mild peanut anaphylaxis. She follows a diet free of all nuts with no reactions.
March 2017: eating chicken curry, she developed immediate severe anaphylaxis, requiring urgent transfer to hospital. Allergological study after the reaction: positive skin tests (CT) for nuts, legumes and spices, all of which were removed from the diet.

January 2018: Allergological study at our centre to determine the food involved (skin tests, determination of specific IgE and SDS-PAGE.


Negative commercial spice battery, Prick by Prick peanut (13 mm), Curry powder (18.5 mm). Prick by prick with curry components less than histamine except fenugreek (23 mm). IgE Peanut > 100 kU/L, Curry 35.2 kU/L, Fenugreek 45 kU/L, Ara h 1> 100 KU/L, Ara h 2 >100 kU/L, Ara h 3 36 KU/L

SDS-PAGE: banding pattern according to that described in the different studies for peanut. Curry and fenugreek extracts (grain and ground) show similar bands: 22,28 and 50 kDa (coinciding with some of those observed in peanut).

Inhibition study with peanut and fenugreek extracts in solid phase: peanut completely inhibits IgE binding of curry and fenugreek extracts.
