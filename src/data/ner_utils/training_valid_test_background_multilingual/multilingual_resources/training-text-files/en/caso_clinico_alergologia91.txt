17-month-old boy, with negative FA for atopy and AP: atopic dermatitis, Bronchitis disneizante. Sensitisation to mites.
The child, playing with unpeeled raw potatoes, developed urticaria on his hands, lip angioedema and conjunctivitis, and was treated with antihistamines.
A few weeks later, while handling a peach, he presented a similar clinical picture. They also reported that after eating pumpkin and courgette he had profuse diarrhoea at the time of ingestion with no other associated symptoms, and after eating Nutella he complained of oral itching.

Tolerates cooked potato and other fruits, has never eaten peach or nuts.

Results:
CT(Prick): with inhalant extracts, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, latex, flours and panallergens: positive to mites, peach, hazelnut, walnut and peanut.
CT(prick/prick) with raw potato skin and flesh: positive, with cooked flesh and skin: negative.
Total IgETotal:139kUI/L
Specific IgE (kUA/L): Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus:58, rPru p3:10,4, rPru p1-p4: < 0,1, pumpkin:0,97,
peanut:0,43, rAra h1,h2,h3,h8: <0,1, rAra h9(LTP):1,58,
Hazelnut: 0,27, rCor a1,a8(LTP),a9: < 0,1,rCor a14:0,29.
Walnut: 5,16, rJug r1:0,67, rJug r3 (LTP): 4,94. Other fruits and vegetables (potato...): <0.1.
SDS-PAGE IgE binding is observed on Prup3 and on a potato protein of pm: 60kDa which does not seem to belong to the LTPs group.
Controlled exposure test (CEP) to peanut negative. PEC to walnut: anaphylaxis with the second dose (1/8 of walnut).

Conclusions:
In conclusion this is a child with atopic dermatitis, sensitised to mites who presents LTP syndrome (allergy to peach and nuts) and allergy to raw potato, which does not seem to be related to his sensitisation to LTP.
