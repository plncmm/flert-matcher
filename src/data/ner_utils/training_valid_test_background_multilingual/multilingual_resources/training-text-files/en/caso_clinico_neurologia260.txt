Anamnesis
A 27-year-old woman with a history of episodic migraine without aura. She was admitted to the Neurology Department in May 2009 for left periocular pain with decreased vision in the outermost area of the temporal hemifield associated with a subjective sensation of hypoaesthesia of the left hemifield. The neurological examination was normal. The patient was admitted with the following tests: normal blood system, normal coagulation, biochemistry (including hepatic, renal, nutritional profile, normal antinuclear antibodies and thyroid hormones), serology for hepatitis A, B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, rubella, syphilis, toxoplasma, varicella-zoster virus, mumps and measles were negative. Lumbar puncture (cytobiochemistry, culture, negative serology, an oligoclonal band), imaging tests (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the brain were normal. In view of the patient's symptoms, a diagnosis of retrobulbar optic neuritis was made and treatment was started with megadoses of steroids, with which the patient improved and was discharged home. Visual evoked potentials were performed on an outpatient basis, which showed mild involvement of the right eye (probable optic neuritis).
The patient was admitted again to the Neurology Department in November 2009 for right retroocular pain that increased on lateroversion, with decreased visual acuity and very subtle blurring in the temporal hemifield of the right eye.

Physical examination
Hydrated, nourished, perfused. Good skin and mucous membrane colouring, overweight. Head and neck: no jugular ingurgitation. Carotids rhythmic, symmetrical, no murmurs. No adenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Higher cerebral functions: conscious, oriented, no dysphasia. PPCC: normal fundus, isochoric and normoreactive pupils, normal eye movements with pain on left gaze. Decreased acuity afferent pupillary defect. Rest of pairs preserved. Strength 5/5 bilateral and symmetrical, normal tone. Osteotendinous reflexes: +++/++++ global, bilateral skin-plantar flexor reflex. Sensibility: superficial and vibratory sensibility preserved. Cerebellum: no dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesias. Normal gait, tandem gait, Romberg negative. No nuchal rigidity or meningeal signs.

Complementary tests
- Blood count: normal.
- Coagulation: normal.
- Biochemistry including basic, renal, nutritional, hepatic and thyroid profile normal. Proteinogram: normal. Anti-streptolysin antibodies, C-reactive protein, normal RF. Antinuclear antibodies: negative.
- Vitamin B12 and folic acid: normal.
- Consultation with ophthalmology: concentric alteration of the visual fields.
- Lumbar puncture: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure 340 mm H2O. Cytobiochemistry, serology and cultures were normal.

Diagnosis
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension syndrome without papilledema.

Treatment
Acetazolamide progressively increased to one tablet every 12 hours. Active lifestyle and attempted weight loss.

Evolution
The patient has been stable since admission, with a single increase of half an acetazolamide tablet to control her intracranial hypertension. In February 2010 she presented a worsening of her visual acuity together with oppressive holocranial headache, nausea and vomiting, for which the patient was admitted and her medication was reinforced with topiramate up to a dose of 50 mg/12h. Given the persistence of the symptoms, intracranial pressure measurements were taken, obtaining figures greater than 260 mm H2O throughout the recording. The neurosurgery department was consulted and, given the persistence of the symptoms, decided to perform surgery with a lumboperitoneal shunt. As a result of this intervention, the patient has ostensibly improved: there has been a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement in the headache, she continues to have outpatient check-ups in Neurology and Ophthalmology, with preserved visual acuity and visual fields.
