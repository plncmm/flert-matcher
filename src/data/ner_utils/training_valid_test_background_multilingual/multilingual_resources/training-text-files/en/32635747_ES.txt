A 39-year-old patient with no medical history presented with chest pain and dyspnoea of two days' duration. He had no fever or cough. The ECG performed in the emergency department showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, associated with decreased PQ. Initial laboratory findings were: C-reactive protein 22 mg/L, leukocytes 13.7×109/L, troponin 15.4 μg/L (N < 0.05 μg/L), arterial lactate 6 mmol/L, sodium 26 mmol/L, potassium 5.6 mmol/L. Chest CT showed pleural and epicardial effusion and atelectasis, but no acute lung injury typical of SARS-CoV-2. As his wife had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, an RT-PCR test was performed, which was positive. An echocardiogram confirmed a moderate perimetral pericardial effusion, without signs of tamponade. On day 5, a cardiac MRI was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of myopericarditis with subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement and myocardial T2 hyperintensity in the inferolateral basal segment.
The patient was treated with colchicine, 1 mg per day. The patient presented evidence of mild heart failure, with dyspnoea, pleural effusion and high N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (4473 pg/mL), controlled with low dose diuretics for 4 days. Hyperkalaemia was controlled with insulin, but hyponatraemia continued despite a fluid-restricted diet. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out. Respiratory status was stable, never exceeding 1 L/min of oxygen. Pleural fluid was an exudate with 28 g/L protein and 376 IU/L LDH. The maximum troponin value was 25 μg/L (N < 0.05 μg/L) and C-reactive protein was 141 mg/L. One episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was successfully treated with amiodarone without recurrence. The pericardial effusion disappeared completely on day 5 of colchicine treatment.
A second complication was rhabdomyolysis, associated with severe myalgias in the feet and legs, with a peak creatine kinase value of 17,070 IU/L (day 5) leading to mild acute renal failure (creatinine 113 μmol/L on day 6). Immunological tests (specific myositis and associated antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-cyclic peptide antibodies, citrullinated neutrophil anti-cytoplasmic antibodies, CH50, C3-C4) were all negative.
The third complication was severe acute liver injury, with ASAT 556 IU/L (15× upper normal value), ALAT 557 IU/L (8×), cholestasis and elevated total bilirubin (36 μmol/L), but normal prothrombin time ratio (96%). Serological tests for viral hepatitis were negative.
The patient was discharged on day 10, with decreased ASAT (416 IU/L, 11× normal value), still rising ALAT (557 IU/L, 8× normal value), normalised bilirubin (11 μmol/L), resolving rhabdomyolysis (myalgia overcome, CPK 2093 IU/L), decreased C-reactive protein (20 mg/L) and troponin (3.2 μg/L), resolved acute renal failure (creatinine 72 μmol/L) and disappearance of heart failure symptoms (no dyspnoea, NT-proBNP 804 pg/mL on day 8).
