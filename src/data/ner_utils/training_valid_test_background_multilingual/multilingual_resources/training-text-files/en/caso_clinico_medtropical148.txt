We present the case of a 23-year-old patient, originally from Le√≥n, Guanajuato, who one month before moved to Mexico City; after the bus ride, he noticed an erythematous and pruritic papule on his neck. One week later, he presented multiple pruritic lesions on the upper and lower extremities, as well as difficulty sleeping due to "intense pruritus"; in addition to finding new lesions every morning upon awakening. During the interrogation, the patient commented that he rents a room with poor hygiene conditions, with no overcrowding or promiscuity. Physical examination revealed a disseminated dermatosis on the trunk and upper and lower extremities, characterised by numerous erythematous and pruritic papules, some with a linear configuration and traces of scratching. Right shoulder with linear erythematous papules. Right forearm, posterior aspect, with erythematous papules.

Dermoscopic examination shows secondary blood crusting due to scratching and hyperpigmented macules. Post-treatment hyperpigmented macules.

Based on the data collected, the diagnosis of insect prurigo secondary to Cimex lectularius was suspected and treatment was started with oral antihistamines, topical steroid medication and hygienic-environmental measures. 72 hours after starting treatment, the patient was assessed again and showed a satisfactory evolution: residual hyperpigmented macules and absence of pruritus. The diagnosis was confirmed by identification of the insect brought by the patient (Cimex lectularius).
