A 26-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden right-sided pleural chest pain and progressive dyspnoea of 3 days' evolution. The patient had not travelled in the previous two weeks and had no history of chest trauma, fever, cough or other systemic symptoms. He was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medication. His partner had been presenting with a non-productive cough for a week. The patient preferred not to disclose further details.

On examination, vital signs showed normal temperature, blood pressure and pulse (118/80 and 122 bpm). He had mild respiratory distress with normal oxygen saturation on room air. His body mass index was 17.6 kg/m2. His blood work revealed lymphocytopenia (0.69 [normal 1.0-3.2] × 109/L). Chest X-ray showed a large right pneumothorax with complete collapse of the right lung, without mediastinal shift.

Because of the patient's respiratory symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed for RT-PCR testing, which demonstrated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A chest drainage tube was placed and subsequently removed; the physician wore full personal protective equipment, including an N95 mask, for the procedure. 

After 48 hours, the patient's symptoms and pneumothorax subsided. He was discharged from the hospital in stable condition and then reported a complete disappearance of symptoms, via video call, on day 1 after discharge.
