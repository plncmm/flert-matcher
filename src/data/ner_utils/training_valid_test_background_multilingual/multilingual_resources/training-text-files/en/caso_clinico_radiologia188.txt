After 48 hours, she returned to the emergency department with worsening symptoms and deterioration of renal function and was admitted to hospital. He presented with dyspnoea and low oxygen saturation, so chest X-rays were taken, leading to suspicion of septic embolism, and antibiotics were changed to Linezolid + Meropenem.

Positive cultures for MRSA corroborated the diagnosis of septic embolism. Final diagnosis: septic embolism, secondary to infectious thrombophlebitis in MID.
