An elderly patient with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease and chronic renal failure was admitted to the intensive care unit in spring 2020 with acute dyspnoea. A week earlier, the patient had noticed some fatigue, with fever and dyspnoea, which did not improve after treatment with cefpodoxime at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for 5 days. A chest CT scan revealed multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities with subpleural condensation. An RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection from a nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.
One day after hospital admission, the patient presented with an erythematous, scaly periumbilical patch with rapid progression of other scaly, scaly plaques on the sides of the trunk and thighs. Some lesions on the arms, shoulders and back were papular. The digitate papulosquamous rash clinically resembled pityriasis rosea. A skin biopsy of the left shoulder revealed foci of spongiosis with focal epidermal parakeratosis and a few spongiotic vesicles with clusters of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells. A moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was observed in the superficial dermis, associated with dermal papillary oedema. We performed an RT-PCR test on a fresh skin biopsy specimen and the result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood test results, including HIV serology, treponemal and non-treponemal antigen testing and PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, were negative, while Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) PCR results were positive, with a viral load of 4.6 log10 copies/mL, indicative of EBV replication. Serum markers indicated reactivation and ruled out acute mononucleosis. The skin rash resolved spontaneously within one week. The patient died of COVID-19-associated disease.
