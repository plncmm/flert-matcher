Anamnesis
A 74-year-old woman, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic and with chronic heart failure, on treatment with amlodipine, enalapril and lovastatin; she came to the neurology department for a progressive clinical picture of two months' evolution, consisting of occasional episodes of disconnection from the environment with "jerking" movements in the left upper limb lasting seconds. Family members also reported memory lapses, delusions and visual and auditory hallucinations. There was no fever or other accompanying symptoms. In view of the rapid clinical evolution, hospital admission was scheduled. Physical examination The systemic examination was normal. Blood pressure and heart rate were good.

Neurological examination: the patient was conscious, spatially disoriented. Inattentive. She had fixation and short-term memory deficits. She could name and repeat well, but failed to understand simple commands. Calculation was preserved. Isolated spontaneous left arm myoclonus at rest. Cranial nerves, strength, sensation, coordination, standing and walking were normal.

Complementary tests
- Blood count and coagulation: normal. Biochemistry: sodium 123, osm 243, ammonium normal, TSH 7.42, T3 and T4 normal, all other parameters were normal. Antinuclear antibodies, RF, erythrocyte sedimentation rate normal. Mirror oligoclonal bands, electrophoresis, B12 and folic acid were normal. Serology for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, syphilis and Borrelia negative.
- Electrocardiogram normal.
- Chest X-ray: vascular redistribution pattern compatible with chronic heart failure.
- Cerebrospinal fluid: 25 leucocytes (lymphocytes), normal glucorrachia and proteinorrachia. No microorganisms were observed in the gram. Neurotropos virus PCR negative. ADA negative. Cytology showed chronic inflammation.
- Electroencephalogram: pseudoperiodic polymorphic slow potential bursts accompanied by suppression of brain activity in the right hemisphere.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): no pathological findings.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (at baseline): normal. Cranial MRI (one month after admission): extensive hyperintense lesion in FLAIR and T2, affecting the right temporal and occipital lobe of cortical predominance with involvement of the hippocampus, which showed diffusion restriction. Cranial MRI, FLAIR sequence: extensive hyperintense lesion affecting the right temporal and occipital lobe, cortical predominance. Cranial MRI, diffusion sequence (DWI): signal restriction in the right parietal lobe.
- Body computed tomography (CT): thyroid nodule, with no other relevant findings.
- Thyroid ultrasound: thyroid nodule of benign appearance. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid: ruled out malignancy. She was assessed in the Endocrinology Department and started treatment with levothyroxine for subclinical hypothyroidism.
- Negative antithyroid antibodies. Negative antineuronal antibodies (during admission). Anti-LGI1 positive (received one year after admission).

Diagnosis
Limbic encephalitis due to anti-LGI1 antibodies.

Treatment and evolution
On the day of admission, the patient presented a picture of disconnection from the environment with ocular clonus, oral automatisms, cephalic and trunk version to the left, guttural noises and fluctuating paresis of the left upper limb, lasting about two minutes, compatible with a partial seizure, for which treatment with phenytoin was started. These epileptic seizures recurred, affecting the level of consciousness, and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of status epilepticus.

After 24 hours, there was a partial improvement in the level of consciousness and she was admitted to the neurology ward. With a suspected diagnosis of probable subacute-chronic encephalitis, treatment was started with methylprednisolone 1 g/24 h i.v., which was maintained for five days and a subsequent tapering course of steroids. Acyclovir i.v. was added (80 mg/8 h). (80 mg/8 h) and phenytoin 100 mg/8 h was maintained. The second cranial MRI confirmed temporal lobe involvement suggestive of limbic encephalitis, which had not been seen in the MRI performed on admission, so screening was performed to rule out infectious, systemic or tumour disease, which was negative. The patient had a torpid evolution and remained in hospital for three months. She presented significant fluctuations in the level of consciousness, sensory motor deficit in the left hemibody and epileptic seizures that required adjustment of antiepileptic treatment on several occasions (levetiracetam, clonazepam, carbamazepine, phenytoin). Hyponatraemia was also corrected. At discharge, the patient was alert, oriented in time and space, with coherent and better structured speech than on admission, but recent memory lapses persisted, a left hemiparesis (4+/5), with left hemihypoaesthesia and left homonymous hemianopsia. MMSE at discharge 28.

The patient has been attending Neurology consultations regularly since then. Approximately one year after admission, the results of the onconeuronal antibodies sent to the Centre of Paraneoplastic Disorders of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) were received, detecting positivity for anti-LGI1 antibodies in our patient's serum. Since then, two years have passed, during which time the patient has been seen in neurology consultations, has experienced progressive improvement, and has not presented epileptic seizures again, although the memory lapses and left hemiparesis persist. No tumour lesion has been detected to date.
