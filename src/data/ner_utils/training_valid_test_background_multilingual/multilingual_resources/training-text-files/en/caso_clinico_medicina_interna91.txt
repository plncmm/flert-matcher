No relevant family history. Toxic habits: Smoker of 10 cigarettes/day (cumulative consumption of 20 packs/year). Sporadic moderate alcohol consumption. Treatment: Escitalopram 20 mg (1-0-0). Lorazepam 2.5 mg (1-0-2). Bisoprolol 5 mg (1- 0-0-0). Gemfibrozil 600 mg (0-0-1).

Current history
Patient attended the Emergency Department of our centre with sudden onset of intense muscular pain in the right arm of 4 hours' duration, with no apparent triggers. She was very worried and anxious about the possible cardiological origin of the symptoms. She does not report dyspnoea, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. She had no previous presyncopal episodes or syncope or other accompanying respiratory symptoms. Although he comments that the pain has different characteristics, the patient had previously been studied by Cardiology in 2006 when he presented with an episode of chest pain with atypical characteristics apparently related to excessive alcohol consumption. The study performed showed elevated CPK levels, with an echocardiogram and a stress test with no abnormalities, ruling out a cardiological origin for both the symptoms and the analytical alterations (no report of the tests performed is attached). On the basis of these data, an ECG (no signs of acute ischaemia) and basic laboratory tests were performed in the emergency department, highlighting an increase in GOT/GPT 31/71 IU/L (n: 0-37/0-41) with other normal liver tests, CPK of 252 IU/L (n: 0-170 IU/L) and aldolase of 7.9 IU/L (n: 0-7.6 IU/L). Inflammatory parameters (ESR and CRP) within normality, with renal normofunction without hydroelectrolytic alteration, Hb 15.4 g/dl, Platelets 263 10E9/L, Leukocytes 6.2 10E9/L. Coagulation normal. Abnormal and Sediment without alteration. In view of these results, the pain was attributed to a probable osteo-muscular origin and the patient was referred to the Internal Medicine department to check the evolution and complete the study of mild analytical alterations. At the Internal Medicine consultation, the patient was re-interviewed, describing exercise intolerance since childhood in the form of asthenia and generalised myalgias, both proximal and distal extremities, without arthritis or new onset cutaneous-mucosal lesions.

Anamnesis by apparatus
No fever or cramps. No loss of muscle mass. No fasciculations or sensory symptoms. He leads a relatively normal life, with the limitation described for the practice of some sport and which conditions him to lead a relatively sedentary life. No cough or phlegm. No recent infectious conditions. No abdominal pain. Bowel habits preserved with 1 bowel movement per day without pathological products. The patient provided previous analyses showing significant variations in CPK levels in recent years, apparently coinciding with the use of statins and concomitant moderate alcohol consumption. He also presented chronic and fluctuating hypertransaminasemia without episodes of jaundice or other signs suggestive of hepatic decompensation, which were attributed to possible non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with negative viral serologies. Various tests had previously been performed (whole body MRI, electrophysiological study, liver biopsy) without finding any alterations.

Physical examination
T.A.: 110/70 mmHg. HR: 79/minute. Afebrile. Sat.02: 96%. BMI: 28 kg/m2. Good general condition. Good colour of skin and mucous membranes. Pharynx: normal. Cardiac auscultation: no alterations. Pulmonary auscultation: normal. Abdomen: soft, depressible, without pain or megaliths. Extremities: peripheral pulses, no oedema. No pain on palpation. No signs of arthritis. Neurological examination was unremarkable.

Evolution and discussion of the clinical case
After reviewing the tests already available and re-historying the patient, we orientated the studies towards a picture of exercise intolerance in the form of asthenia and myalgias accompanied by oscillating CPK levels and mild hypertransaminasemia, without elevation of inflammatory parameters or signs suggestive of first or second motor neuron disease. Furthermore, in the absence of compatible skin lesions and characteristic muscle weakness, we reasonably ruled out the diagnoses of polymyositis and/or dermatomyositis. The diagnostic approach we followed was as follows:

1. given the possibility of an adverse drug reaction, we reviewed and withdrew the potentially implicated drugs (Gemfibrocil/Benzodiazepines/Escitalopram).
2.serologies were requested for CMV, Epstein barr, Herpes virus and HIV, which were negative, and a study of hypertransaminasemia was completed with serologies for HAV, B and C. We added an autoimmunity study (ANA, AMA, ASMA and Anti-LKM), obtaining ANA nucleolar pattern 1:320 and ASMA 1:80.
3. We completed the study with an abdominal Doppler ultrasound scan showing diffuse hepatic steatosis with an area of perivesicular preservation, with no evidence of solid focal lesions. Multiple vesicular polyps (probably cholesterol) with a bile duct of normal calibre.
Once the possible acquired aetiologies of CPK elevation had been ruled out, the case was oriented towards a possible hereditary myopathy. We therefore delved into the family history and the characteristics of the patient's symptoms. No one in the patient's family had a similar clinical picture, and as for the symptoms, the patient reported early fatigue and myalgia with improvement in exercise tolerance after several minutes from the onset. A review of the literature revealed three main groups of hereditary myopathies:
- Glycogenoses,
- Lipid metabolism disorders
- Mitochondrial diseases.
In order of frequency, encompassing the three groups, three entities stand out:
- Carnitine palmitoyl transferase II (CPT II) deficiency,
- Myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease (V)).
- Phosphorylase kinase deficiency (VIII).
According to the diagnostic algorithm ----, elevated CPK levels together with severe exercise intolerance (in the form of asthenia and myalgia) from the onset of exercise but which improves significantly after 5-10 minutes, are highly suggestive of McArdle's disease. We therefore performed an ischaemia test which confirmed a discrete elevation of lactate compatible with difficulty in glycogen metabolism. A muscle biopsy was performed and showed the presence of striated skeletal muscle tissue with structural preservation and a relative increase in the amount of glycogen in the muscle fibres. In the immunohistochemical study carried out, the absence of historeactivity against myophosphorylase stood out, with normality of the rest of the historeactive patterns, confirming the existence of a myopathy due to myophosphorylase deficiency corresponding to McArdle's disease.
