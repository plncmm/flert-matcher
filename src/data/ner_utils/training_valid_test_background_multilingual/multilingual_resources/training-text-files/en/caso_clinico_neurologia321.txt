Anamnesis
A 38-year-old woman, 19 weeks pregnant, came to the Emergency Department after suffering two episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures during sleep, with an interval of 15 minutes between them. She had no personal or family history of interest, except for gestational diabetes, generalised seizures in one of her previous pregnancies and headache. She had not received treatment nor had she undergone a study. She also had no personal or family history of repeated miscarriages or previous vascular pathology, cranioencephalic trauma, central nervous system infections or other predisposing factors.

Physical examination
The neurological examination showed only mild bradypsychia, with no other pathological findings, and after being seen by the gynaecology department, which found no evidence of gestational problems, she was admitted to the neurology ward.

Complementary tests
- Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray: no pathological alterations of interest.
- Blood count: haemoglobin 11 mg/dl, rest normal.
- Coagulation and complete biochemistry, including calcium and magnesium, thyroid hormones, liver profile, lipid profile: normal.
- Electroencephalogram (EEG): reported as "left hemispheric delta focus radiating contralaterally".
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: multiple hyperintense lesions were observed in the white matter of both hemispheres in periventricular location, semioval centres, subcortical, basal grey nuclei, especially the left lenticular, all suggestive of ischaemic aetiology of vasculitic origin.
- Echocardiogram: prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild insufficiency, with no other findings.
- Electromyogram: normal.
- Multimodal evoked potentials: no alterations.
- Iron profile: iron 117 μg/ml, transferrin 317 mg/dl, transferrin saturation 26.4% and ferritin 21 μg/ml.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 14 mm.
- Cerebrospinal fluid, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant antibodies, rheumatoid factor, complement C3 and C4, ANCA, ACE, ANA, anti-DNA, SS-A, SS-B, immunoglobulins and proteinogram: normal.
- Serology (lues, Brucella, HIV 1 and 2, Borrellia burgdorferi) and neurotropic virus serology: no pathological alterations.

Treatment and evolution
Based on the aforementioned clinical and laboratory data, the case was diagnosed as isolated central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV). Angiographic study was contraindicated due to gestation and she had remained asymptomatic from the neurological point of view since admission, so it was decided to maintain a watchful waiting attitude, starting treatment with carbamazepine at a dose of 200 mg/8 h together with iron and oral folic acid. At 36 weeks' gestation, the baby was delivered euthecdotally and without incident. After eleven months asymptomatic and with good seizure control, she returned to the emergency department with low reactivity, slurred speech and decreased strength in the right side of the body. Her only symptom in the previous days was headache, with no other focal or associated symptoms. The systemic examination was normal. The neurological examination showed motor aphasia, right central facial paresis, right hemiparesis (muscle balance 4/5 overall in the right upper limb and right lower limb), right haemihypoaesthesia, right extensor flexor skin-plantar reflex and left flexor, with the rest of the examination being normal. Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and laboratory tests (including carbamazepine levels) were normal. An urgent brain CT scan was performed, showing an acute hypodense lesion in the left basal ganglia. At that time there was no possibility of endovascular therapy and with the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, in the context of a probable NCAV, treatment was started with high-dose corticosteroids (1000 mg methylprednisolone/24 h), antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg, gastric protection with omeprazole and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin at a dose of 40 subcutaneous units. The patient was left on bed rest and absolute diet, except for medication, and continued treatment with carbamazepine at the previous doses. She was treated with corticosteroid boluses for 5 days, with good tolerance, and subsequently started oral therapy and treatment with calcium and calcitriol 0.25 μg on Tuesdays and Fridays. Further laboratory tests (haemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete biochemistry, urine sediment, proteinogram, immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, ANA and anti-DNA, ANCA, anticardiolipin antibodies, ACE, anti-SSa and anti-SSB antibodies) were performed, which were normal. A new cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiogram (transthoracic, similar to the previous one, and transesophageal, which was not tolerated) and cerebral angiography were also requested. Cranial MRI showed an area of acute infarction in the left basal nuclei and multiple periventricular and subcortical lesions similar to the previous cranial MRI. Ischaemic infarction in the left basal ganglia. Multiple hyperintense lesions in the white matter of both hemispheres of periventricular location, semioval centres, subcortical, basal grey nuclei, especially the left lenticular, all suggestive of ischaemic aetiology of vasculitic origin.

Angiography showed a saciform aneurysm in the cavernous tract of the left carotid siphon (immediately infraophthalmic, with an approximate size of 5-6 mm in diameter of the sac by 2.5 mm neck) and an obstruction in the horizontal portion of the left middle cerebral artery, with obstruction of several sylvian branches filled by collateral circulation. Saciform aneurysm in the cavernous tract of the left carotid siphon. Embolised aneurysm.

Days later, the aneurysm was embolised by microcatheterisation, placing two platinum coils inside the aneurysm with satisfactory closure. The aneurysm was completely obstructed and the patient was admitted to the ward 24 hours later. Fifteen days after admission, a mild speech disorder persisted, with mild dysarthria. There was no facial paresis and muscle balance was normal, with preserved sensation and no other associated deficits.

Ten years after the initial diagnosis, she had been admitted sporadically for seizures and status epilepticus, always in the context of poor compliance with treatment. In the last admission, also for the same cause, the Mini-mental State Examination showed a score of 21/30, with a pathological Clock Test. She presented moderate cognitive impairment, mainly at the expense of calculation, concentration, reading, writing and praxis, with no other associated neurological focality. He has never presented outbreaks of systemic vasculitis. Currently, she continues to be treated with carbamazepine 200 mg/8 h, valproic acid 500-0-1,000, omeprazole 20 mg and acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg. She continues to be followed up in Neurology outpatient clinics.

Diagnosis
- Epilepsy with generalised seizures and moderate cognitive impairment secondary to isolated central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.
- Ischaemic stroke in the left N. lenticularis secondary to arterio-arterial embolism due to aneurysm in the left carotid siphon in its intracavernous trajectory.
- Endovascular treatment of left carotid aneurysm.
