Male patient aged 31 years, construction worker. No known drug allergies, ex-smoker of half a packet/day for 5 years, not a heavy drinker, not a consumer of other toxic substances. No significant personal or family history.

History, current illness and physical examination
Previously asymptomatic, he presented with intense pain, coldness and generalised pallor in the left hand of sudden onset (without previous trauma) while carrying out his daily tasks, for which he consulted his health centre. As no radial or ulnar pulse was found, the patient was referred to our hospital where he was assessed in the emergency department by Vascular Surgery, which documented acute occlusion of the humeral artery, which led to an urgent embolectomy without incident, embolic material was sent for pathological anatomy and a cardiological assessment and echocardiography were requested. On physical examination the patient was in good general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative. Well hydrated and perfused, eupneic at rest and tolerating decubitus. Afebrile, BP 110/70, HR 70xmin, normal cardiopulmonary auscultation, no signs of heart failure. Embolectomy wound in MSI with no data of complication. The rest of the physical examination was completely normal. A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed at the bedside showing a mass in the lateral wall of the left atrium and the patient was admitted to Cardiology for further study.

Complementary tests
- CBC: Complete blood count, coagulation and profiles with no data of note.
- Electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm maintained, no repolarisation alterations, conduction disorders or findings suggestive of cavity growth.
- Chest X-ray: Normal cardiac silhouette. Absence of congestive pattern, no pleural effusion. No space-occupying images in lung parenchyma.
- Echocardiography TT/TE + ECO 3D: Mass of 40x27 mm occupying the entire left atrial appendage, protruding out of it towards the atrium, with irregular borders with some areas of greater echogenicity suggesting fibrosis and on the atrial surface there is a filamentous and mobile extension of 12 mm with characteristics of high embolic risk. The left pulmonary veins are not invaded, with normal flow. The ADA and ACX are seen in the AV groove below the atrial appendage, without being invaded. Normal mitral valve, aortic valve and right valves. Left ventricle of normal dimensions, wall thickness and contractility. Normal right chambers. No pericardial effusion.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Tissue formation in the left atrium that completely occupies the atrial appendage and extends into the atrial cavity as a vegetative mass with well-defined contours, attached to the upper and lateral wall. It measures approximately 4cm in its maximum axis which is craniocaudal. In the four-chamber plane it measures approximately 34x27mm. Although it is adjacent to the pulmonary ostium, these remain patent. It is not related to the mitral valve or the interatrial septum. It has homogeneous and intermediate signal intensity in all sequences. In the late enhancement sequences, annular peripheral fine enhancement is found, which can be observed in myxomas. No alterations in thickness and segmental and global contractility or alterations in tissue signal or late enhancement in myocardium. No cardiovascular anatomical alterations.

Clinical evolution
During his stay on the hospital ward, the patient remained asymptomatic and without incident. In the imaging tests mentioned above, a differential diagnosis was made between atrial myxoma of atypical location vs. thrombus. In the pathological anatomy study of embolic material, high-grade cellular atypia suggestive of malignant neoplasia was found. Cardiac surgery was consulted and the case was accepted for resection of the mass under extracorporeal circulation and the procedure was carried out without complications. The intraoperative pathological anatomy study confirmed high-grade dysplasia, and the left atrial appendage was resected over its entire length, achieving lesion-free margins. During his stay in the ICU he evolved favourably without incident and after stabilisation he was transferred to the cardiac surgery ward.
The definitive pathological anatomy study of the resected mass was reported as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, an extension study was performed with thoracoabdominal CT where no metastatic lesions were documented and it was decided to discharge him on anticoagulation and to carry out out outpatient follow-up with Oncology. Two weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted for clinical manifestations compatible with embolic stroke secondary to tandem occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery. He was successfully treated by mechanical thrombectomy and the patient was left without residual neurological deficit; the pathological anatomy study of the embolic material confirmed its tumoural aetiology.
He was subsequently admitted to Oncology, and a repeat TTE and extension study (cranial MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and bone scintigraphy) was carried out, documenting recurrence of the mass in the left atrium with similar size and characteristics to those described in the pre-surgical study and the presence of brain, lung, liver, adrenal and bone metastases.
Chemotherapy with adriamycin was started. Despite chemotherapy treatment, the patient had an unfavourable evolution and died three months after the initial diagnosis was made.  

Diagnosis
- Undifferentiated pleomorphic cardiac sarcoma with early recurrence after surgical resection. 
- Rapidly progressive multiple metastatic disease.
