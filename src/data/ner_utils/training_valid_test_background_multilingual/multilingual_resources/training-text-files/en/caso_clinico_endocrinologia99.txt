Personal history: 54-year-old woman with a history of obesity and hypertension on treatment with Enalapril 20 mg/day. No known drug allergies. Family history: No consanguinity of her parents. Father with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type 2 and deceased of lung cancer. Mother died at the age of 94 with no pathologies of interest. Sister lives healthy and brother with DM type 2. Present illness: She attended the Emergency Department of the HUVN with fever associated with abdominal pain.
Emergency examination: Poor general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative. BP: 105/67, Ta38o. Obesity with truncal predominance; generalised hirsutism.

Cardio-respiratory auscultation: Eupneic, without pathological noises with oxygen saturation: 96%, heart rate: 102 bpm. Abdomen: painful palpation in the right hypochondrium. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

General laboratory tests: Glu: 118 mg/dl, HbA1c: 5.8%; Cr: 0.75 mg/dl; Na+: 139 meq/L K+: 4.5 meq/l, GOT: 68 U/L; GPT: 71 U/L; GGT: 112 U/L; CRP: 312. Leukocytes: 18400 thousand (86% N) Cholesterol: 205 mg/dl; TG: 297 mg/dl.

Abdominal CT in the ER: There are 3 liver lesions of irregular confluent contours and showing a wall that is intensely enhanced after administration of iv contrast. The largest of these lesions is located in segment 6-7 and is approximately 6.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm in size. The other 2 lesions are located in segments 4 and 6 and have a diameter of approximately 2.5 cm.

Clinical judgement on admission: Hepatic abscess (by culture of the exudate and blood cultures it is not possible to make an exact microbiological diagnosis).

Treatment: Admitted to the infectious diseases department. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and the liver abscess was completely resolved with drainage by means of a Pigtail catheter. The patient's clinical evolution was positive, with cessation of fever and abdominal pain.
After 2 weeks, a follow-up abdominal CT scan was performed, which reported good progress in the resolution of the liver abscess and the absence of the uterus and adnexa.
Due to these unexpected findings, the Endocrinology Department was consulted. The patient confirmed that she had primary amenorrhoea for which she had never consulted and severe hirsutism since puberty.

Endocrinological examination: obesity with truncal predominance, weight: 103.3 kg; T: 160; BMI: 40.35 kg/m2. CC: 112 cm. No goitre. Mild-moderate facial hirsutism but severe on the chest. Linea alba and androgenic distribution of pubic hair. No deep-toned voice. No androgenic alopecia. Mammary hypoplasia. External genitalia explored in hospital bed: Apparently feminine with absence of inguinal masses.

Gynaecological examination: Vulva with moderate hypertrophy of the labia majora and bilateral palpable nodules, minimal enlargement of the clitoris and vaginal blind hole approximately 1 cm in diameter.

Hormonal study: LH: 12.3 mIU/ml; FSH: 29 mIU/ml, Testosterone (T): 364 ng/dl (N<75), Free T: 8.42 ng/dl (N<0.95), Dihydrotestosterone (DHT): 0.42; TL/DHT: 20.04 (N<10). PSA: <0.01 ng/ml, Rest normal.
Karyotype: 46,XY
Pelvic ultrasound: No testicles or prostate were identified. External genitalia ultrasound: In the right labium majus, there was evidence of a right testicle with homogeneous echostructure, without evidence of solid nodular lesions. Dilatation of the vascular plexus with a basal diameter of 2.5 mm.

In the left labium majus, the left testicle was identified with heterogeneous echostructure in which there was evidence of a solid intraparenchymal lesion with foci of gross calcification, irregular contours of approximately 18 x 13 mm. No hydrocele. Isolated left inguinal adenopathy.
Testicular germ cell tumour markers: B-HCG: <0.5 mIU/ml, Alpha-Fetoprotein: 1.7 ng/ml (N<9), LDH: 205 U/L (N<247).
Genetic study: blood was collected in Edta to isolate leukocytes and complete PCR amplification of the exons of the SRD5A2 gene (coding for the enzyme 5-alpha reductase2) located on chromosome 2p23.1 was performed. The patient presented in compound heterozygosis 2 different pathogenic variants: c.344G>a (p. GLY115Asp) and c.679C>t (p.Arg227Ter).

Clinical judgement: ADS/DSD 46,XY due to 5-alpha reductase 2 deficiency with testicular tumour. Treatment: Left orchidectomy is scheduled and preservation of the right testicle is decided. The patient wishes reassignment to male gender with reconstructive surgery for which she is referred to the Andalusian Health Service referral unit.
