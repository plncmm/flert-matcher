A 30-day-old woman consulted for fever, non-specific exanthema, cough and rhinorrhoea. Feeding with artificial formula with good intake, no vomiting and normal stools. Physical examination: reticulated macular rash, erythematous on the lower limbs. Laboratory tests: CRP 18mg/dl, PCT 0.19ng/dl, leukocytes 19000/ul, eosinophilia 40% (7,500Eos/mm3). Peripheral blood smear with normal morphology eosinophils. IgE 752KU/L, CAP to cow's milk: 21.70KU/L, alpha-lactoalbumin (ALA) 8.97KU/L, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) 20.40KU/L, casein 15.80KU/L. Prick-test: ALA 1mm, BLG 1mm, Casein 2mm, Cow's milk 3mm. Virus serology negative and ANA negative. Chest X-ray, echocardiogram, chest and abdominal ultrasound without alterations. With the diagnosis of IgE-mediated APLV and viriasis, feeding was started with hydrolysed casein formula with good tolerance. Eosinophilia decreased to 680Eos/mm3 at 2 months. The study was repeated at 3 months with IgE 9.93KU/L and IgE(CAP) allergens: cow's milk 0.20KU/L, ALA 0.00KU/L, BLG 0.00KU/L, casein0.05KU/L. The following month prick-test with ALA: 0mm, BLG 0mm, Casein 0mm and cow's milk 0mm. An open oral challenge test was carried out with 13% starting formula with progressive increases until 240mL was completed, and cow's milk was immediately negative and reintroduced. One month later, an increase in eosinophilia was detected (7.3%, 980 Eos/mm3), and the patient remained asymptomatic with a normal postnatal development.
