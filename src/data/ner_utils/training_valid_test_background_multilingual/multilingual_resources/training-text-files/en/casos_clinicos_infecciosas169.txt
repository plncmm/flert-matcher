We present the case of a 33-year-old woman, smoker of 2-3 cigarettes/day, mother of a healthy child, with no other medical or epidemiological history of interest, who presented to her health centre with a 24-hour clinical course consisting of amnesia of recent events, temporospatial disorientation and fever of up to 38.5oC with bacteraemic crust. She was discharged home with paracetamol, but returned a few hours later with uncontrollable vomiting, and was transferred to her local referral hospital with suspicion of acute meningoencephalitis. Blood cultures were taken, ceftriaxone 2 g intravenous was prescribed and she was referred to our referral hospital for neurological assessment. On arrival, hypotension of 85/55 mmHg refractory to crystalloid fluid therapy was observed, as well as an elevated heart rate of 105 beats per minute, together with elevated lactate levels (up to 2.5 mmol/l) and decreased diuresis rate, worsening level of consciousness (10 points out of 15 on the Glasgow scale), without meningeal signs, with few petechial lesions appearing on the arms and legs at this time. Cardiorespiratory auscultation and abdominal examination showed no pathological findings.
Computed tomography (CT) of the skull was performed, which was normal, and lumbar puncture, obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with 125 red blood cells/mm3, 3 leukocytes/mm3, glucose of 65 mg/dl (peripuncture glycaemia of 77 mg/dl) and protein of 30.1 mg/dl, with xanthochromia and gram-negative staining. CSF polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Blood tests showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 285 mg/l and procalcitonin of 10 ng/ml, with the rest of the biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation being normal. She continued with intensive crystalloid infusion, and the empirical antibiotherapy started prior to the CT scan was maintained (meropenem 2 g every 8 hours and linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours intravenously). In the first 24 hours, the patient began to improve until she completely recovered her neurological condition, remained awake, oriented, haemodynamically stable and recovered her diuretic rhythm. Progressive disappearance of the petechial lesions was also observed. Blood cultures obtained at the regional hospital isolated Neisseria meningitidis, and the family members were questioned and reported three episodes of meningococcal meningitis in the family with sepsis criteria (specifically in a brother, the mother and a maternal aunt), all of which had a satisfactory outcome; and one sister had a history of repeated respiratory and otorhinolaryngological infections.

Differential diagnosis
At the time of admission, a differential diagnosis was made based on the family history of meningococcal infections. In view of this circumstance, we decided to rule out a possible underlying familial immunodeficiency, including the following:
- Common variable immunodeficiency
- X-linked agammaglobulinemia
- Hyper-IgM syndrome
- Selective antibody deficiency
- Asplenia
- Deficiency of IgG subclasses
- Complement factor deficiency

Evolution
The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of our hospital to continue treatment with ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously every 12 hours) and a study of primary humoral immunodeficiency. During the first days of admission, he developed respiratory distress associated with bibasal pleural effusion, which improved within 48 hours with bronchodilator treatment, corticosteroids, diuretics, oxygen therapy and continued antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone. The possibility of a possible superimposed respiratory infection was considered, but no causal microorganisms other than N. meningitidis were isolated, this bacterium being a recognised cause of respiratory infection, so antibiotic treatment was not modified. During his stay on the ward, an extensive study was performed, including a thoracoabdominal CT scan, which ruled out neoplastic lesions or the absence of spleen, showing only the presence of moderate pleural effusion and passive atelectasis in both lower lobes. HIV, HBV, HCV and cytomegalovirus serologies were negative. The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Immunoglobulin levels IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD and IgE were in the normal range, with low values for IgG2 (146 mg/dl, for a normal value of 241-700 mg/dl) and normal values for the other subclasses. The proteinogram showed no relevant findings. Lymphocyte subpopulations were normal. Serum properdin study gave a value of 27 mg/dL (within normal range). Complement analysis revealed complement 50% (CH50) less than 10 U/ml (normal values 31.6 to 57.6 U/ml), with C5 levels of 4.08 mg/dL (normal values 7 to 18 mg/dL). C1q had levels of 218 mg/dl (normal values 10 to 25 mg/dl). All other complement factors (C2 to C9) were normal. The patient was discharged one week later, having normalised all the analytical alterations, normalised the acute phase reactants and disappeared both systemic and respiratory symptoms, and the antibiotic treatment could be de-escalated to oral amoxicillin (1,000 mg every 8 hours) for 7 more days, to complete a 14-day regimen. She was referred to the outpatient clinic for follow-up, and was scheduled for an immunisation programme with meningococcal A, C and W vaccines; meningococcal B; Haemophilus influenzae serotype B; influenza; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with 13 serotypes and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with 23 serotypes. Six months later, the patient was stable and had no new infectious episodes. The rest of her first-degree relatives were called for complement levels, and the same vaccination schedule was applied.

Final diagnosis
Septic shock secondary to meningococcaemia.
Possible central nervous system infection "decapitated" after 24 hours of antibiotic treatment. 
Primary immunodeficiency due to congenital complement factor 5 deficiency, coupled with possible IgG2 deficiency.
