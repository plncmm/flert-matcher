A 7-year-old female schoolchild from a native community in the district of Nieva in the north-eastern region of Peru, with 14 days of illness, who began with fever, general malaise, hyporexia and progressive weight loss. After 10 days, a productive cough with bloody expectoration and respiratory distress was added, and she was referred to our Hospital. She was admitted to the Emergency Department in poor general condition, thin, tachycardic, tachypneic and with pallor of the skin and mucous membranes. Pulmonary auscultation showed subcrepitant sounds at the base of the right hemithorax, and admission anaemia was moderate, microcytic and hypochromic with no leukocytosis or eosinophilia. Thoracic radiography and multislice spiral tomography (TEM) showed bilateral parahilar interstitial pulmonary infiltrate with areas of ground glass and cystic lesions in the left lung base. Lung X-ray and CT scan showed condensation and diffuse interstitial infiltrate with ground glass areas and cystic lesions in the left lung base, the largest one measuring 5 x 3 cm.
The patient received antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and clindamycin and remained stationary. Both Mantoux test and Koch's bacillus investigation in gastric aspirate and stool were negative. Parasitological examination of stool showed eggs of Paragonimus spp. as well as Ascaris lumbricoides, uncinaria and Trichuris trichiura (Figure 3). For this reason, triclabendazole was added at 10 mg/kg in two doses, followed by albendazole at 400 mg per day for 5 days with disappearance of both fever and cough, as well as improvement of appetite and weight recovery. In the control thoracic TEM, the bilateral interstitial infiltrate decreased, as well as the cavitations in the left lung base, and she was discharged after 31 days of hospitalisation.
