A 71-year-old woman came to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Personal history of obesity, hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes. She presented with abdominal pain located in the right hypochondrium for 72 hours, which started after a large meal. It was accompanied by chills and nausea without vomiting. On examination, the patient's general state of health and the intense pain on compression of the right hypochondrium were striking. As complementary tests, a blood test was performed, highlighting leukocytes with neutrophilia. An abdominal X-ray showed a radiolucent halo surrounding the gallbladder and an abdominal ultrasound. Following the ultrasound findings (distended gallbladder, with a thickened wall (7.3mm), air in the gallbladder wall and multiple lithiasis inside the gallbladder) and the suspicion of emphysematous cholecystitis, it was decided to complete the study with a CT scan. The abdominal CT scan with contrast showed parietal thickening of the gallbladder with air bubbles and multiple lithiasis inside, together with significant inflammatory changes around the gallbladder, leading to a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The patient underwent emergency surgery by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pathological anatomy confirmed a gallbladder with combined stones measuring 11.3 x 5 cm, with a diagnosis of cholelithiasis and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. The microorganism isolated was Clostridium Welchii. The patient evolved favourably and was discharged after 10 days.
