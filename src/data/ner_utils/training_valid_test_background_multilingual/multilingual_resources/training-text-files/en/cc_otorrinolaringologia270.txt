A 53 year old man came to the emergency department with dyspnoea and stridor of one hour's duration, with no known allergies, fever or aspiration which, on initial assessment, remained constant. He referred to us an epiglottic lesion being followed up in another Community. A nasofibrolaryngoscopy was performed, revealing oedema that started in the rhinopharynx and at the oropharynx level, preventing endoscopic progression due to the large obstruction. There was no evidence of cervical swelling, local heat, erythema, crusting or other signs typical of deep cervical infections. After the same evaluation, intravenous corticotherapy was prescribed, and due to his imminent poor condition and destabilisation of his vital signs, including a large drop in saturation, a cricothyrotomy and subsequent conversion to tracheostomy was performed.

After stabilising the patient, we requested a cervicothoracic CT scan which showed images compatible with a left parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and prevertebral abscess, the interior of which showed complex partitions and thick walls. The mediastinal space was found to be free. A cervical approach was made to drain the parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and prevertebral abscess, which, to our astonishment, appeared without purulent content or signs of active infection, so we performed a laryngoscopic approach, revealing a large cystic lesion of amber colour from the left aryepiglottic fold, which we proceeded to marsupialise and sent its contents to microbiology. We prescribed antibiotherapy and corticotherapy and the evolution was satisfactory, managing to decannulate the patient after 6 days of follow-up and hospitalisation, with correct healing of the surgical wound, without obstruction of the airway. The anatomopathological result of the lesion was a fibrovascular polyp and the microbiological study of the contents was Veillonella.
