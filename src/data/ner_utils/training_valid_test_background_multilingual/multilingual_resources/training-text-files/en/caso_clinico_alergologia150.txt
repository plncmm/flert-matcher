Lactande of 9 months, with no PA of interest or previous admissions, was admitted after presenting with repeated persistent vomiting, with significant weakness, pallor and hypotonia. After admission, blood tests were performed, serum therapy and an absolute diet were administered, and the patient improved dramatically in the first few hours. The blood test showed metabolic acidosis with no signs of infection. Everything returned to normal in the first 12 hours, with no new symptoms. Three weeks later, she was admitted again for a similar condition, with the same evolution. In this second episode, the mother related the vomiting to food. On both occasions she had eaten panga uns 2-3 hours earlier.

Specific IgE was performed for the most common food allergens at this age, and was negative for fish and positive for other foods.
Months after the second admission, it was decided to perform a provocation test with panga, which was positive.
