A 20-year-old male patient from the city of Buenos Aires attended the outpatient clinic of the Dermatology Division of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas due to the presence of polymorphous lesions on the abdomen, inguinal folds, periumbilical region, wrists and gluteal folds. This dermatosis, which had been present for 4 months, caused intense itching, especially at night.
Skin scrapings from the trunk, hands and perianal area were sent to the clinical parasitology laboratory, where few adult specimens and eggs of S. scabiei were observed.
A plan of hygienic measures was implemented with the use of cream soap and oral treatment with ivermectin (1 tablet of 6mg), which was repeated after one week. In addition, topical application of clobetasol twice daily and use of moisturising cream was indicated. Hydroxyzine 50mg per day for 10 days was also prescribed. The patient was recalled after 10 days for follow-up. Treatment with ivermectin was given to all cohabitants as a preventive measure to avoid infection.
All patients with predominantly nocturnal itching and suspected scabies should undergo skin scraping and investigation for mites. Early diagnosis and treatment of this ectoparasitosis is important to prevent its spread. Human scabies is a skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei variety hominis.
