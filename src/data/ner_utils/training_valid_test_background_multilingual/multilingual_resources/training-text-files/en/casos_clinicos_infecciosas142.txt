A 35-year-old man, painter by profession, active smoker of a pack of cigarettes a day, occasional cannabis user and regular cocaine user. He was brought by his relatives to the Accident and Emergency Department for confusional symptoms of three weeks' evolution consisting of difficulty in naming objects and incoherent language, bradypsychia, temporospatial disorientation and frequent forgetfulness in carrying out daily activities. The only history of interest was a positive HIV serology recently performed at his health centre, pending confirmatory Western blotting. He also reported intense asthenia with unquantified weight loss in the last four months, as well as a non-productive morning cough related to smoking, with no other symptoms by organs or apparatus.
On physical examination he was afebrile, with blood pressure of 91/61 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, eupneic with oxygen saturation of 100% without supplementation. Neurologically he was conscious but bradypsychic and disoriented in time, with no signs of neurological focality or signs of meningismus. Auscultation showed generalised hypophonesis. No other relevant anomalies were observed.
Urgent laboratory tests revealed lymphopenia of 830 lymphocytes/μl with normal red and platelet series. C-reactive protein (CRP) showed a value of 6.7 mg/l. Cranial CT scan showed hypodensities in the cerebral white matter in both hemispheres, without mass effect, suggestive of leukoencephalopathy of uncertain origin. CSF analysis showed only hyperproteinuria of 59 mg/dl and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus were negative. Chest X-ray showed rounded, thin-walled calcified images, the largest of which had a hydro-aerial level inside. The analytical results previously performed by his doctor were compiled, in which only the aforementioned relative lymphopenia stood out, with thyrotropin, cortisol, tumour markers and serology for hepatitis B and C virus and syphilis negative, and with the aforementioned positive serology for HIV. In view of these findings, admission to the Infectious Diseases ward was decided to complete the study, initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) with elvitegravir (EVG) 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 10 mg co-formulated. HIV viral load (VL) determinations in plasma and CSF were requested, with results of 496,000 and 260,000 copies/ml respectively, as well as lymphocyte subpopulations, showing 154 CD4/μl and 840 CD8/μl lymphocytes. HLA-B*5701 was positive and no mutations were found in the antiretroviral resistance study. Serological testing for Echinococcus granulosus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii was extended, with positive IgG for CMV only.
Brain MRI showed bilateral frontal white matter involvement, of the corona radiata with extension towards the knee and posterior arm of the right internal capsule, of a patchy nature, with a certain degree of lesional confluence. These lesions appeared hyperintense in the T2 and diffusion sequences, with diffusion restriction being evident in some of them. After intravenous contrast administration, no areas of enhancement were seen. The EEG recorded a normal baseline tracing interrupted by rhythmic bursts of bifrontal delta activity. As for the study of the pulmonary lesions, a thoracic CT scan was requested, which showed multiple cysts of different sizes, with a hydro-aerial level and dense content, without contrast uptake. The culture and serial sputum smears, as well as the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis, were negative.

Differential diagnosis
When faced with a patient with HIV infection and neurocognitive alterations, we must consider a broad differential diagnosis, both with aetiologies common to seronegative patients and with others more specific to HIV-infected patients. The following entities should be highlighted:
- Neurological diseases. Given the age of the patient, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or adult normotensive hydrocephalus could be considered.
- Pseudodementia secondary to depression.
- Metabolic encephalopathies secondary to ionic disturbances and intoxication, which in our case were reasonably ruled out.
- Focal or diffuse encephalopathies. In patients with advanced HIV infection, we can distinguish between these two types of encephalopathies. Among the former, given that the CSF had normal outflow pressure and showed only hyperproteinorrachia with negative microbiological study, most infectious aetiologies were ruled out. In addition, serology for Toxoplasma spp. was negative, and neuroimaging tests did not reveal focal lesions with peripheral ring uptake typical of toxoplasmosis or lymphoma, nor of tuberculomas or cryptococcomas. However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) would fit with the clinical picture and radiological images. As diffuse HIV-associated encephalopathy we would have HIV-associated dementia. With regard to cystic lung lesions, the first question to ask is whether we are dealing with true cysts or other simulating entities, such as cavities, centrolobular emphysema or cystic bronchiectasis, for which a thoracic CT scan is necessary4. True cysts are defined as rounded areas of air contents separated from the lung parenchyma by a thin wall less than 2 mm thick. Depending on the location, they are classified as subpleural or intraparenchymal, as in the case of our patient. These, in turn, are subdivided into subgroups according to other thoracic CT findings:
- With ground-glass imaging. This pattern is typical of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or desquamative interstitial pneumonia.
- Nodules. They appear in lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, amyloidosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, among other entities.
- No additional findings. Initially, one might think of echinococcosis, although serology was negative; and tuberculosis, although serial smears and the IGRA test were negative.

Evolution
The patient had a slow but progressive cognitive recovery, with a control CSF HIV CV of 147,000 copies/ml at 4 weeks after initiation of ART. CSF PCR for JC virus was negative. However, initially, no major changes were observed in the control neuroimaging, pending further cranial MRI. As for the pulmonary lesions, fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, obtaining positive polymerase chain reaction for P. jirovecii, so treatment was prescribed with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX) 800/160 mg at the usual weight-adjusted doses, initially intravenously for 15 days and then orally. Subsequent outpatient examinations showed marked improvement of the lung cysts with complete disappearance of the cysts after treatment.

Final diagnosis
HIV-associated dementia and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
