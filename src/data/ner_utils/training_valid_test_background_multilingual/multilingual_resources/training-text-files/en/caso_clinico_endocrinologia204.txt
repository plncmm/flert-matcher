We present the case of an 18-year-old female patient with outpatient laboratory tests, where glycaemia was found to be 189 mg/dL, with no other biochemical alterations. The patient had no personal history of diabetes mellitus or any other known autoimmune or endocrinopathic disease. Intrauterine growth retardation, short stature that required follow-up by paediatrics with treatment with growth hormone until the age of 16 years, and detection of renal and hepatic cysts at the age of 4 years, being diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.

On examination BMI of 21 kg/m2, with no somatic data of interest.

After analytical findings, the study was completed with a result of HbA1c of 6.20% and Oral Glucose Overload of 75 g with a pathological result after 2 hours (209 mg/dL). Negative pancreatic autoimmunity (antiIA2 and antiGAD ac < 1 U/mL), HOMA 1.90, Insulin 8.2 uUI/mL and C-Peptide 2.15 ng/mL.

During the interview, the patient referred to a maternal family history of diabetes (great-grandmother, grandmother and mother's sister), all of whom had been treated with oral antidiabetics. Existence of multiple cysts in this branch of the family, without having been studied, located in the head and neck, and polycystic ovarian syndrome in her maternal sister. No history of cardiovascular disease on the paternal side.

In view of the renal anomalies described, we consider it appropriate to rule out monogenic diabetes, specifically mutation of hepatic nuclear transcription factor 1Î² (HNF 1beta): MODY 5 type.
