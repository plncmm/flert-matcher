We present a case of disseminated infection by Mycobacterium chelonae in a 58-year-old woman.

Her personal history included:

- Type II diabetes mellitus on treatment with vildagliptin 50mg /metformin 850mg.

- Chronic renal insufficiency on dialysis treatment.

- Chronic ischemic heart disease. Secondary dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF 27%.

Current disease:

Presents multiple indurated nodular lesions with erythematous base on medial aspect of legs, arms and upper trunk. The skin lesions evolved into necrotic areas that fistulised and oozed into the skin.

The lesion was biopsied and found to be compatible with neutrophilic lobular and septal panniculitis.

Cultures showed growth of aerobic and anaerobic species present in any organism. Culture results for atypical fungi and mycobacteria were negative.

The patient was admitted for worsening of the lesions, with multiple erythematous erythematous maculo-papular suppurative lesions with confluence and plaque formation with some deep ulceration with non-elevated borders.

Biopsy of the lesions was repeated and collagen bands were observed.

New cultures of the indurated lesions showed growth of Mycobacterium chelonae colonies sensitive in vitro to clarithromycin.

Treatment with clarithromycin e.v. was started, but the cutaneous involvement worsened to the point of dissemination of the infection. She was admitted to the ICU.

The patient finally died as a result of ventricular fibrillation during a dialysis session in the ICU.
