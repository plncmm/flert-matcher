A 73-year-old man with a history of hyperuricaemia and depression, who in April 2017, and without previous trauma, presented with coccygeal pain radiating to the lower limbs of progressive intensity, leading to several visits to the emergency department.
She visited the internal medicine department in September 2017 due to a 10kg weight loss, hyporexia and occasional profuse sweating associated with the described low back pain, with normal initial EF.
Analytically, renal function, ionogram, liver and thyroid profile, proteinogram, haemogram and coagulation were normal, with negative tumour markers except for slightly elevated Cyfra 21.1 and negative serology for HIV and hepatotropic viruses. Basic radiological studies (chest and spine) were normal.
The weight loss progressed, so the study was completed with MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine, bone scintigraphy and abdominal thoracic CT scan, all of which were normal.
One month later, the patient's clinical condition worsened, reporting intense asthenia and difficulty standing upright, and a PET-CT scan was performed, showing inflammatory uptake in the rectal-anal mucosa. Over the course of 10 days he developed an associated high fever. On ET, BP 107/64 mmHg, HR 100 bpm and Ta38.3o, requiring admission. Laboratory tests showed elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 330.55 mg/L, ESR 61 mm/h, leukocytosis 23200/Ul), macrocytic anaemia, hypolipidaemia, CK 1090 U/L and impaired renal function. The control chest-abdomen CT scan showed oedematisation of the subcutaneous cellular tissue at perineal and scrotal level, peri-regional air dissection and inflammatory changes in the inguinal canal, extraperitoneal pelvis and gluteal region.
