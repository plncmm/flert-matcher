Anamnesis
A 78-year-old man with a personal history of hypertension controlled only by diet. He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 14 years ago, which after surgical and hormonal treatment was now considered to be in remission. The only current medical treatment was sildenafil every 15 days. As a family history of interest, he reported that a brother had been diagnosed with generalised epilepsy, suffering sudden death during an episode.
The patient consulted for an abrupt episode consisting of an ascending epigastric surge, followed by a confusional episode, with disconnection from the environment, incoherent language, sucking automatisms and movements of the left upper limb, which lasted approximately 5 minutes, with subsequent confusion and disorientation, which slowly recovered in about 30 minutes, with amnesia of the entire episode. During the transfer to the hospital and in the emergency department, he suffered two other episodes of similar characteristics. When questioned specifically, he reported that for some years he had been suffering from brief episodes of disorientation associated with a feeling of mental blockage, for which he had not consulted.

Physical examination
The patient's vital signs were normal and he was afebrile and without meningeal signs. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation and the rest of the general examination showed no pathological findings. In the neurological examination, the patient was alert, conscious and perfectly oriented, with preserved cognitive functions and coherent and fluent speech. Examination of the cranial nerves, muscle balance and gait were normal, with symmetrical and exalted myotatic reflexes, with bilateral flexor flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex. The only significant finding on examination was a slight left facial-brachial hypoaesthesia.

Additional tests
- A comprehensive blood test including haemogram, general biochemistry, coagulation, immunological study (ANAS), thyroid function and proteinogram showed normal values. Tumour markers, serology (Borrelia, lupus, Brucella and HIV) and antineuronal antibodies were negative.
- The cerebrospinal fluid study included biochemistry, serology (lupus, Borrelia and Brucella), viral PCR and culture, all of which were negative.
- The electrocardiogram was normal and the chest X-ray showed some old calcified images.
- A thoraco-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan did indeed show bilateral calcified pleural plaques, with involvement of the diaphragmatic pleura, suggesting old pathology such as asbestos exposure, and simple liver cysts.
- Brain CT scan showed only some lesions compatible with old lacunar infarcts and predominantly frontal cortical atrophy.
- Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed scarce images of chronic ischaemic appearance together with moderate frontal cortical atrophy, with striking hyperintensity in long TR sequences in both parahippocampal limbic systems, without contrast uptake. Coronal slices in FLAIR sequence of magnetic resonance imaging showing bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal hyperintensity of right predominance.
- A Doppler study of supra-aortic trunks showed a probable proximal critical stenosis of the right vertebral artery.
- The electroencephalogram recording was abnormal, with occasional epileptiform discharges (spike morphology) in the right temporal region.

Diagnosis
Complex partial seizures of temporal origin, secondary to bilateral mesial hippocampal sclerosis, with adult (late) presentation.

Treatment
Treatment with valproic acid was started, with adequate control of the complex partial seizures and therapeutic levels of valproic acid (92.8 Î¼g/ml) were obtained at discharge.

Evolution
During outpatient follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no new episodes during the 9 months of evolution, and the control cranial MRI was similar to the previous one.
