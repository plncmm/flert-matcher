An 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease and hyperlipidaemia presented to the emergency department with a 15-minute episode of transient numbness and weakness in the right arm and anomic aphasia. Vital signs at the first consultation were within normal values. Initial neurological examination was normal. The stroke protocol was activated. The cranial CT scan showed no acute manifestations. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Thrombolysis was postponed and the patient was admitted with a diagnosis of transient ischaemic stroke. As the patient reported mild dyspnoea with dry cough, a PCR for COVID-19 was performed and was positive. D-dimer was elevated at 3442 ng/ml (normal <880 ng/ml); other inflammatory markers were also elevated. An MRI showed an acute infarct in the left medial temporal lobe. A craniomaxillofacial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed a mild right M1 segment stenosis. No arrhythmias were detected on telemetry. The patient was treated with aspirin, statins and discharged to a rehabilitation centre with monitoring.
