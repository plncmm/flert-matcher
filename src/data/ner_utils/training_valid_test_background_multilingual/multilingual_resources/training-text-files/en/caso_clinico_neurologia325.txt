Anamnesis
A 38-year-old woman, originally from Ecuador, who has been living in Spain for 12 years. Her personal history is as follows: depressive disorder, megatransverse C7 and tinnitus.

She was brought to the Emergency Department of our hospital due to a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. According to the description of a witness, the patient had suffered focal seizures with buccolingual automatisms, oculocephalic deviation to the left and subsequent generalisation with tonic-clonic jerks. The patient does not recall any history of infection or previous seizures. She describes oppressive holocranial headache of one year's evolution, of fluctuating character, with little response to analgesic treatment, without vomiting or photo-sonophobia, which has been attributed to her cervical pathology.

Physical examination
Haemodynamically stable, afebrile. Normal cadiorespiratory auscultation. Abdominal and extremities examination without alterations.

From the neurological point of view: patient conscious and oriented, Glasgow 4-5- 6. Isochoric pupils reactive to light. No signs of meningeal irritation. Normal speech. Cranial nerves normal. Normal muscle strength and sensibility. Osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical. Coordination not impaired. Bilateral flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex. Romberg negative. Normal gait.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: general biochemistry, haemogram and haemostasis without alterations.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 72 bpm, without repolarisation alterations.
- Chest X-ray: no alterations of acute evolution.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): right frontal cystoid lesion of well-defined contour with a small adjacent calcification suggestive of parasitic lesion. Left parietal and right frontal calcification.
- Electroencephalogram: normal bioelectrical activity, no epileptiform alterations.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: ventricular system of normal size and morphology. Inside the frontal horn there is a 7 mm parasitic cyst with visible scolex inside, without contrast enhancement. The cisterns of the base are free. Vascular structures of correct configuration, permeable dural venous sinuses. Nodular lesion in the right frontal region, 15 mm in diameter, probably between the medial and inferior gyrus. It shows enhancement suggesting inflammatory changes due to parasite destruction. Other small cystoid images of 5 to 6 mm are also identified, one posterior to the right Sylvian fissure and two others in the upper posterior parietal region. No changes are seen in the diffusion-weighted sequence. Parasitic cyst of 7 mm with visible scolex inside. Cyst in the upper posterior parietal region. Nodular lesion in the right frontal region of 15 mm in the medial and inferior gyrus.
- Normal fundus.

Diagnosis
Neurocysticercosis. Symptomatic epilepsy.

Treatment
Antiepileptic treatment was started with levetiracetam 1,000 mg every 12 hours, in addition to cysticidal treatment with albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day for one month and oral dexamethasone.

Evolution
During her stay in the Neurology Department, the patient remained asymptomatic and free of crises. After discharge, she was followed up in the outpatient neurology department for a follow-up MRI scan, with no new findings or complications.
