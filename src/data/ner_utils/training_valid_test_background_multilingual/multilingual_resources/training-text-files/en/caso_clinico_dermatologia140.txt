Anamnesis
A 70-year-old man with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum, on treatment with FOLFOX-cetuximab for 3 months. No known diabetic or other history of interest. He had been admitted for treatment of obstructive atelectasis of metastatic origin and had been receiving oral corticosteroids since admission to control dyspnoea.

Physical examination
During his stay the patient developed a blackish papule with erythematous-violaceous halo on the left lower limb, with no other skin lesions. The lesion rapidly progressed to a necrotic plaque 4 cm in diameter, very painful, with irregular borders and a large homogeneous purpuric halo. No clear cutaneous entry site was found. It could only be related to a urine collection bag that the patient had carried on the limb, close to the initial skin lesion. There were no systemic symptoms either.

Complementary examinations
Several laboratory tests were carried out and showed no significant alterations. A deep biopsy of the ulcer revealed foci of ischaemic necrosis and numerous fungal emboli invading the vascular walls and underlying tissue. The fungus was a fungus with unseptoriated hyphae, later identified as Rhizopus oryzae.

Diagnosis
Having ruled out distant involvement, the diagnosis of primary cutaneous mucormycosis was established.

Treatment and course
Treatment was started with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, with favourable evolution until hospital discharge, followed by oral Posaconazole until review in one month. Surgical debridement of the lesion with skin grafting was also necessary.
