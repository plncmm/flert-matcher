Anamnesis
35-year-old woman; her personal history included smoking 8 cigarettes a day and drinking 1-2 beers/day. No drug use. Tubal ligation, no gynaecological consultation in the last year.
The patient came to the clinic for vulvar pruritus and eruption of vulvo-anal lesions of 2 months' duration. She had not received any medical treatment. She describes sexual relations only with her stable partner and without the use of a condom; the partner has no genital symptoms.

Physical examination
She has perivulvar vegetating lesions with a verrucous appearance and flat, rounded, shiny vegetations, the latter also in the perianal area. From their morphology, the first lesions look like condylomata acuminata and the second like flat condylomata. There is also a macular rash on the abdomen and upper limbs, with a slight pruritic sensation.

Additional tests
- A protocolised study of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was carried out with vaginal and cervical exudates, a cervical cytological study and a PCR study specific for human papillomavirus (HPV) of the perivulvar vegetating lesions. It is completed with serology for lues, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis B and C virus.
- In the exudate collection, Gardnerella vaginalis is present and there are guide cells. Cervico-vaginal cytology with moderate dysplasia (CIN III). The PCR test for perivulvar HPV shows a positive result for HPV subtype 31. Serology is compatible with lupus, positive HAART and ELISA with positive RPR at 1/32. HIV and HBV negative. HCV indeterminate.

Treatment and evolution
Treatment was started with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million IU, 1 vial per week for 3 weeks and metronidazole vaginal ova for her G. vaginalis vaginosis.
One month after the first visit, the lesions corresponding to flat condylomas are not visible and the lesions that looked like HPV infection, confirmed by PCR, have a cicatricial appearance and have practically disappeared.
