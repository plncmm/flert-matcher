A 74-year-old man, hypertensive, diabetic and with a history of ischaemic stroke, polymyalgia rheumatica and SAHS, presented with left temporal oppressive headache.

Urgent brain CT scan showed occupation of the left sphenoid sinus. The study was completed with subsequent MRI, with findings compatible with mucocele with protrusion and bulging towards the clivus. He underwent CENS by Neurosurgery and ENT, with a sample taken for culture, and S. commune was diagnosed. He was discharged after 24 h, with a treatment regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg for 7 days. During check-ups, the patient continued to have intermittent headaches and a follow-up MRI scan was performed, showing a recurrence of the mucocele with occupation of the left sphenoid sinus, bone involvement and osteomyelitis at the base of the skull. The study was completed with a PET-CT scan and no uptake was observed. The patient was referred to the Infectious Diseases Department where voriconazole 200 mg every 12 h was prescribed for 6 weeks until the acute phase reactants normalised and the patient's symptoms disappeared.

DIAGNOSIS
Chronic sinusitis with the causative agent being the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune.
