Anamnesis
A 28-year-old male dancer from Israel, with a personal history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 2008 without current treatment, occasional cocaine and alcohol user. He was admitted to Internal Medicine for a clinical picture of paraesthesias in the right hemibody together with visual alteration after previous consumption of 1 g of cocaine. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an acute ischaemic lesion in the posterior territory (left thalamus). The study was completed with a cerebral MRI angiography, which showed no findings. Viral load was 200,000 copies and CD 4 647 cells. He was discharged with right upper quadrantanopsia as a sequela and treatment with statin. Two weeks later he came to the emergency department for a new episode of right facial and hemicorporal haemihypoaesthesia.

Physical examination
On arrival at the ED, blood pressure 120/80mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, afebrile. The general examination by apparatus was normal. The neurological examination showed the presence of right upper quadrantanopsia (sequelae), right hemifacial algesic hypoaesthesia in the second and third trigeminal branches and in the right hemibody, and dysmetria in the finger-nose test in the right upper extremity. The rest of the examination was normal.

Complementary tests
- Haemogram: normal with adequate leukocyte formula, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 46 mm/h.
- Biochemistry: lactate dehydrogenase 722 IU/l (230-460), transferrin decreased, thyroid hormones altered (TSH 5.36 μIUI (0.5-4.7), T3l 2.73 pg/ml (2.77-5.27). Proteinogram: weak monoclonal peak in the gamma zone.
- Coagulation and thrombophilia study: minimal elevation of fibrinogen and free protein S deficiency, the rest being normal (including protein C, lupus anticoagulant, Leyden's factor V and antithrombin).
- Autoimmunity: weakly positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (22.6 UGPL/ml), negative IgM ANCA, rheumatoid factor, circulating immunocomplexes, ANA, anti-DNA, negative anti-B2 glycoprotein. 
- Serology: EBV IgG positive, hepatitis A IgG positive; Treponema, toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C negative. HIV-1 viral load: 177,930 copies; CD 4 432 cells/μl, no genotypic resistance to antiretrovirals.
- Electrocardiogram and monitoring 48 hours: sinus rhythm, known right bundle branch block.
- Chest X-ray and transthoracic echocardiogram normal.
- Cranial CT scan showed irregular hypodense lesions in the left parasagittal occipital region and in the white matter of the left temporal lobe, compatible with subacute-chronic ischaemic lesions.
- The new brain MRI shows the appearance of a new focal lesion in the left thalamus hyperintense in long TR and marked diffusion restriction, suggesting acute-subacute ischaemia. Brain MRI, diffusion enhanced sequence: acute ischaemic lesion in the left thalamus.
- Intracranial MRI angiography was repeated, which showed no visualisation of the left PCA from its origin, the right one being patent. Angio-MRI: no visualisation of the left PCA from its origin. The right PCA was patent.
- Lumbar puncture: glucose 49 mg/dl, protein 66 mg/dl, 40 leukocytes/mm3 (80% mononuclear) and 90 red blood cells/mm3. Culture: negative for bacteria and mycobacteria, negative for enterovirus polymerase chain reaction and herpes simplex 1 and 2; VDRL negative; cytology: acellular specimen.

Diagnosis
Recurrent cerebral ischaemia probably related to HIV-associated vasculopathy. Hypergammaglobulinaemia, protein S deficiency, weakly positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies.

Treatment and evolution
Antiretroviral therapy was started with darunavir, ritonavir and tenofovir plus emtricitabine and antiaggregation with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, after which no new episodes have occurred, with mild ataxia of the right upper limb persisting.
