A 9-month-old infant presented with generalised urticaria 1 week after the introduction of gluten-containing cereals. Exclusive breastfeeding until 4 months, introduction of gluten-free cereals well tolerated.
No pathological perinatal history, three bronchitis with no admissions.
Mother kiwi allergy, maternal uncle asthmatic.
Outstanding examinations: IgE gluten 6.9KU/L, wheat 4.7KU/L, Tria19 (omega-5 gliadin) 0.11KU/L, barley 2.8KU/L, rye 2.9KU/L, maize 0.22KU/L, oats 0.11KU/L, millet 0.06KU/L. Prick gluten 6/6, prick all other cereals negative.

Results:
In view of the positive results for different cereals with and without gluten, it was decided to complete the study with an oral gluten challenge test (OPT), which was positive. Given that the diagnostic tests were inconclusive as to the gluten fraction causing the reaction, immunoblotting was indicated, showing positive bands for glutenin and negative for the rest. Allergy to glutenins was confirmed. A gluten-free diet was indicated.
At 4 years of age anaphylaxis after accidental ingestion of wheat. Wheat IgE 15.3KU/L was requested, prick gluten 7/5. Omalizumab was started due to the risk of severe reactions. After 8 months, prick-point-final and PPO negative to gluten. Cooked foods with gluten are introduced. Currently third year of Omalizumab, 2 years of gluten diet, IgG4 wheat>30mg/L.
