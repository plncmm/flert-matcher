A 16-year-old male with no known drug allergies. His personal history only includes an umbilical hernia operated on in childhood. He has no toxic habits and does not receive any home treatment on a regular basis. He has been correctly vaccinated and is attending school. He lives in the countryside and has contact with domestic and wild animals, including chickens, rabbits, dogs, ducks and a corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus).

The patient came to the Emergency Department because, while spending a few days at the beach, he began to notice a progressive increase in the size of his right lower limb. It started at the level of the foot and, on arrival at the ED, had already spread to the root of the ipsilateral thigh, presenting with fever up to 39.5oC. The patient had no recollection of stings or bites. In the previous days he presented odynophagia, no cough or expectoration, no gastrointestinal alterations and no associated micturition symptoms. She denied abdominal pain, pruritus, unsafe sexual relations or trauma. He had been with friends and they were all asymptomatic.

On arrival at the ED, the patient was in good general condition, alert, conscious, oriented in all three spheres and haemodynamically stable, with BP 121/67 mmHg, well hydrated and perfused, sun tanned. Eupneic at rest and with ambulation, with saturations of 98% without oxygen support. The oropharynx was hyperemic but without tonsillar exudates, no lymph nodes were palpable. On examination, he had rhythmic heart tones at 80 systoles per minute, with no audible murmurs. Vesicular murmur was preserved in both hemithoraxes and the abdomen was soft, depressible and not painful on deep palpation, presenting hydro-aerial sounds with no masses, megaliths or signs of peritoneal irritation. The right lower limb was warm and oedematous, with impaction mainly at the level of the twins. At the internal supramalleolar level, there were two millimetric, symmetrical, punctate lesions, with no exudates, and Homans' sign was negative. He was able to move all his fingers and the paedial pulses were present. The contralateral limb showed no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. The neurological examination did not show any focality.

Complementary tests performed in the ED showed a leukocytosis of 30,740 cells/μL at the expense of neutrophils (28,350 cells/μL), with the red and platelet series being normal. Coagulation times were prolonged, INR was 1.28, prothrombin time (PT) was 15.7s (64.3%) and D-dimer was 940 ng/dL. Biochemistry showed a creatinine of 2.13 mg/dL (previous renal function was normal) and a C-reactive protein of 363.46 mg/L, with a normal ionogram. Blood cultures were taken, which were subsequently negative, and a Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb showed marked thickening of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, with significant signs of oedema and increased vascularisation in relation to an infectious-inflammatory process, with no collections or signs of deep vein thrombosis, the findings being suggestive of cellulitis.

In view of the patient's clinical situation, it was decided to admit him to the Infectious Diseases Department with the diagnosis of cellulitis of the right lower limb, without ultrasound findings of complications, with a possible entry point at the internal supramalleolar level and acute renal failure in this context, initiating empirical intravenous treatment with cloxacillin 2g/6h and ceftriaxone 1g/24h.

Differential diagnosis
Infections of the skin and soft tissue constitute a broad group of clinical pictures of diverse aetiology, pathogenesis and prognosis, defined according to their location and independently of the microorganism that causes them. When faced with a soft tissue infection, as in the case of the patient presented, it is important to carry out a detailed anamnesis and an exhaustive examination in search of a possible entry point, as the epidemiological history referred by the patient can guide us to the aetiological approach, as the different microorganisms that may be causing the infection will vary depending on the environment and the way in which inoculation has taken place. Therefore, we should consider the following nosological entities to make the differential diagnosis in the case of infectious cellulitis:
- Superficial thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis: these are relatively frequent processes, mainly in situations that facilitate a state of hypercoagulability. They usually manifest with painful localised oedema and reddening of the skin, as in the case of the patient presented here, and this entity was ruled out following a Doppler ultrasound scan in the absence of associated thrombotic pathology.
- Contact dermatitis: this is characterised by the presence of a reddish skin rash with intense itching and appears due to direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it. Vesicular lesions usually appear, which the patient did not have, and are not usually associated with fever, so this pathology was ruled out.
- Eosinophilic cellulitis or Sweet's syndrome: this is an inflammatory skin condition with a high degree of clinical polymorphism and can be self-limiting and recurrent. There is usually a history of previous atopy or urticaria, as well as peripheral eosinophilia, elevated ESR and immunoglobulin E1, alterations that were not present in the patient.
- Gout: usually manifests as joint inflammation and not of the entire lower limb as in the case in question, caused by the deposit of monosodium urate. It is more common in older people and generally occurs in people with hyperuricaemia.
- Erysipelas: this is an acute dermal-hypodermal infection, non-necrotising and generally caused by S. pyogenes. The onset is usually sudden with fever and a raised, erythematous, painful and warm plaque with well-defined borders. The present case had progressive oedema and no plaques were seen on examination.
- Cellulitis is an acute infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue characterised by circumscribed pain, erythema, swelling and warmth. It can be caused by indigenous staphylococcal and streptococcal flora colonising the skin and adnexa or by a wide variety of exogenous bacteria. The patient presented with a compatible clinical picture and two millimetric lesions at the supramalleolar level that could be the gateway, and was therefore the diagnosis of suspicion.
- Deep necrotising infections: these are infections that can affect the dermis, subcutaneous cellular tissue, superficial or deep fascia and muscle, associated with necrosis and with rapid progression. These entities include myositis, myonecrosis and necrotising fasciitis. The appearance of fever is frequent, as well as pain, hypersensitivity or cutaneous hypoaesthesia, the existence of necrosis or haemorrhagic blisters that the patient did not have at the time of admission.
- Gangrenous ecthyma: this is a cutaneous manifestation of a severe infection, generally due to P. aeruginosa, and usually occurs in immunosuppressed or hospitalised patients. In healthy patients there is a history of folliculitis and furunculosis and it is usually a rounded, oval lesion with an erythematous halo and necrotic centre that may be single or multiple, with the lesion not appearing on the patient.
- Lymphoedema: oedema caused by lymphatic dysfunction which may be primary (Milroy's syndrome, Meige's syndrome) or secondary (recurrent erysipelas, filariasis, post-therapeutic, neoplastic or post-traumatic). Given that the patient had no history that would lead us to suspect lymphoedema, as well as the presence of fever and elevated acute phase reactants, we ruled out this pathology.

Evolution
During admission to the ward, renal function improved after the administration of serum therapy, and a serum creatinine level of 1.19 mg/dl was observed in the control analysis at 48 hours. After 48 hours of empirical treatment with cloxacillin 2g/6h and ceftriaxone 1g/24h, the patient was still febrile, so treatment was modified and the spectrum was broadened and antibiotherapy was started with clindamycin 600mg/8h plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2g/200mg IV every 8 hours, and all serial blood cultures taken up to that time were negative. After 72 hours, a previously absent phlyctena appeared and the patient continued with significant oedematisation and pain in the affected limb, while preserving paedial pulses, sensitivity and mobility, so urgent assessment by the Traumatology service and a computed tomography (CT) scan were requested, The CT scan showed thickening of the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue in the distal third of the thigh/knee and especially in the leg of the right lower limb, with a slight enhancement in some areas of the superficial fascia, findings compatible with cellulitis and superficial fasciitis. There was also an increase in volume in the musculature of the posterior compartment of the right leg compared to the contralateral leg, with fluid dissecting the muscle planes, including the deep transverse fascia, which showed a faint linear enhancement, findings compatible with deep fasciitis. However, it should be remembered that neither the absence of this gas nor the presence of enhancement in the fascia ruled out necrotising fasciitis, so a joint assessment was requested with Traumatology, which, in view of these findings, performed percutaneous fasciotomies in three compartments, using a lateral and medial approach to the right calf, abundant purulent fluid was found in the posteromedial and lateral area, samples were obtained and a profuse lavage with saline and povidone iodine was performed.

After the fasciotomy, the patient reported symptomatic improvement, but the following day he continued to be feverish and in pain, and S. pyogenes wild strain was isolated in the culture obtained in the operating theatre, and antibiotic treatment was maintained with clindamycin 600mg/8h plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2g/200mg IV every 8 hours. The patient required dressing in the operating theatre every 48 hours, for which reason the code was changed to Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology with joint follow-up by the Infectious Diseases service, describing a poor evolution of the medial wound with continuous drainage of purulent material from the posteromedial aspect of the thigh and the gemellar region. In the samples obtained in the sixth treatment (17 days after admission) Enterobacter cloacae was isolated, resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (with which he had been receiving intravenous treatment for 15 days together with clindamycin and having completed treatment for S. pyogenes), so this treatment was suspended and treatment was started with piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) 4g/8h with loading dose and 4-hour extended perfusion. Another CT scan of the right lower limb was performed 18 days after admission, showing abscesses from the distal third of the thigh to the ankle region, the main location being the posterior aspect of the limb, starting in the thigh between the femur and the biceps femoris and descending to the popliteal fossa, where the largest collection measuring 12x3x3 cm was located, descending and surrounding the popliteal vascular bundle to the ankle region. There were isolated abscesses in the external calf, a solution of continuity and loss of substance in the anterior and posterior soft tissues of the leg, with scattered gas bubbles in the soft tissues, with contrast uptake by the wall of the patellar bursa. Forty-eight hours after starting treatment with P/T, the patient was afebrile and treatment was maintained for a total of 13 days, being suspended after obtaining several negative cultures from the samples obtained in the operating theatre dressings. The patient required a total of 19 operating room dressings and reconstruction with anterolateral vascularised flap coverage of the right thigh with a favourable evolution, starting to support the limb progressively and requiring rehabilitation sessions at discharge.

Final diagnosis
- Necrotising fasciitis due to S. pyogenes and superinfected by E. cloacae with repeated fasciotomies and coverage by anterolateral flap of the right thigh.
- Acute renal failure in this context resolved.
