This is a 63-year-old female patient from a rural area in Mayabeque province. She had a personal history of bronchial asthma, for which she was prescribed prednisone during crises; however, she sometimes self-medicated herself and had been taking this drug regularly for the last 10 years.

The patient went to the Emergency Department of the General Hospital 'Calixto Garc√≠a', presenting vomiting, intermittent diarrhoea alternating with constipation, pain in the epigastrium, asthenia and weight loss of more than 20 pounds in the last 2 months. He also reported episodes of pruritic maculopapular lesions on the feet, groin and hands for the past 5 years, which he said lasted about 15 days and generally improved with steroid creams. Physical examination revealed only pain on deep palpation in the epigastrium. Complementary examinations showed the following results: haemoglobin 12.3 g/L, leucocytes: 11.9 x 109, polymorphonuclear: 71.9 x109 , lymphocytes 17.4, platelets 329 x109, eosinophil count 0.79 x109, HIV: negative. Panendoscopy: duodenitis and erythematous pangastritis, hiatal hernia and mild biliary reflux. Chest X-ray: signs of pulmonary emphysema without other alterations. Parasitological examination of stool: the first examination was negative; the second and third examination showed rhabditoid larvae of S. stercoralis, 4 per field at 400X magnification.
