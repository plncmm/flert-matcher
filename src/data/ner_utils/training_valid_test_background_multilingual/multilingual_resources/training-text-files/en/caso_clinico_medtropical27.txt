Man 43 years old, from Spain, who travels several times a year to Brazil and Venezuela for periods of 10-15 days for work (first trip in January 2000). He has no known allergies or pathological history of interest, and is a regular blood donor. He has not received any vaccinations in recent years. Her stays will basically be in major cities (Caracas, Valencia, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador de Bahia, Sao Paulo), but she will take advantage of the weekends to do some sightseeing and would like to visit places such as Angel Falls or the Iguazu Falls. At the Travel Clinic - December 1999 - she is prescribed and administered vaccinations against: yellow fever, tetanus-diphtheria, hepatitis A+B and typhoid fever. Hygienic food and water measures are advised, as well as barrier measures to avoid insect bites.

In this case, although the traveller is not travelling through rural areas, he/she may be exposed to bites from mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus, a mainly urban disease and the most frequent arbovirosis in the world, with a high incidence in Asia, Africa, Central and South America.

Dengue virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species of mosquitoes.
