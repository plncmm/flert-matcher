An otherwise healthy 11-year-old boy presented with status epilepticus requiring anticonvulsants; cerebrospinal fluid showed evidence of encephalitis (921 erythrocytes, 16 leukocytes, 8% neutrophils [normal 0-6%], with protein 97 [normal: 40-170 mg/dL] and glucose 92 [normal: 20-100 mg/dL]). He presented with two days of generalised weakness with no respiratory symptoms and no fever; ED temperature was 39.3oC. A cranial CT scan was unremarkable. An electroencephalogram revealed intermittent frontal delta activity. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 and rhinovirus/enterovirus, but the latter were not found on cerebrospinal fluid PCR. The patient recovered completely without treatment after six days.
