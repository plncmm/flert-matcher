Anamnesis
A 45-year-old woman, with no medical history of interest, was referred to the emergency dermatology department for facial lesions of three weeks' duration. The picture had begun with a slightly pruritic lesion on the left upper eyelid with subsequent spread to other facial areas. The patient had no lesions at other sites or other clinical signs of interest. At her health centre she had been prescribed topical corticosteroids on suspicion of arthropod bites and, a week later, oral antivirals with a diagnosis of possible herpes infection. None of these treatments had been effective. There was no temporal relationship with trauma, new cosmetics, new drugs or sun exposure. Nor were there similar symptoms in cohabitants. The lesions significantly interfered with her personal and professional life as she worked facing the pubic area.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed multiple erythematous plaques 1-2 cm in diameter with a melanic crust on the surface. The lesions were limited to the facial region and some of them were associated with serous exudate. They were not indurated or tender to palpation.

Complementary examinations
Samples were taken for microbiological culture.

Diagnosis
Based on the clinical appearance of the lesions, the diagnosis of non-blistering or contagious impetigo was established. One week later the diagnosis was confirmed by a positive culture for Staphylococcus aureus.

Treatment
Oral treatment with cloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 days was prescribed. In addition, betamethasone and fusidic acid cream was applied to the affected areas twice a day for 7 days, and an antiseptic shower gel was prescribed for daily hygiene.

Evolution
Ten days after the first visit, the patient came to the clinic without active lesions, presenting only residual erythematous-brownish macules. She was then advised to use photoprotector at least twice a day to minimise the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
