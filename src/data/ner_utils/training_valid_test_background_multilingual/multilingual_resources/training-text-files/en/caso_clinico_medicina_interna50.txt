We present the case of a 37-year-old woman, with the only clinical history of anxious-depressive syndrome treated with lorazepam and fluoxetine, who consulted the emergency department a week after suffering a tonsillar process manifested with odynophagia and treated with antibiotherapy by her primary care physician, with a sensation of numbness in the left hemibody, diplopia and gait instability. In view of these symptoms, a cranial CAT scan was performed, which was normal, and the patient was discharged. However, at home there was a progressive worsening of the symptoms, with a generalised sensation of numbness, inability to ambulate and diplopia, for which reason she was admitted to the hospital ward. After 24 hours of admission she continued to worsen, with the appearance of intense somnolence, disorientation, bilateral ophthalmoparesis (with ptosis and limitation of all eye movements) and predominantly crural tetraparesis, with bilateral Babinski; in this situation the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, requiring orotracheal intubation.

Complementary tests
- Haemogram and biochemistry with no significant alterations. Anti-NMDA and anti-acetylcholine receptor negative. Negative antiganglioside antibodies (including antiGQ1B).
- CSF: normal biochemistry. PCR of enterovirus, Herpes virus and Varicella Zoster negative. Bacterial and fungal cultures negative. BAAR negative.
- Cranial CT scan: normal.
- Cranial MRI: normal.
- Control cranial MRI (performed 2 weeks after admission): no significant alterations in the trunk or cerebellum. Faint symmetrical focal images of increased signal in Flair can be seen at the level of both internal capsules, without restriction in diffusion, as well as other subcortical images at the parietooccipital level of similar characteristics, of a non-specific nature.
- Cervical spine MRI: discrete posterior disc protrusions at the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.
- Electrophysiological study: normal.
- Control electrophysiological study: sensory, motor and F-response conduction of both MMII normal.
F of both MMII normal. EEG: slowed bioelectrical activity of medium voltage without other superimposed anomalies. Single fibre EMG: normal study. VEPs: normal study. Calculation of VA of OI:1.

Evolution
The patient was admitted to the ICU for 2 weeks, where she evolved favourably in relation to the clinical picture described above. When she returned to the conventional hospital ward, she was conscious and alert, with complete ophthalmoparesis and left ptosis, limitation of bilateral horizontal and vertical gaze in the left eye, without nystagmus. In addition, tetraparesis of intensity 4/5 in upper limbs and 3/5 in lower limbs, ROT somewhat alive in upper limbs, weak patellar and conserved Achilles, right Babinski, and indifferent left plantar cutaneous reflex. In the following days he continued to progress favourably, and the tracheostomy was closed without incident, with progressive recovery of the motor deficit, returning to being able to ambulate, and with slow improvement of the ophthalmoplegia, but with persistent left palpebral ptosis and limitation of the upper vertical gaze in the left eye.

Diagnosis
Bickerstaff's encephalitis.
