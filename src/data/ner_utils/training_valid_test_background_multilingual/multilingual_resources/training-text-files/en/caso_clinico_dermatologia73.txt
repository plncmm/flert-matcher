A 15-year-old male patient with no past medical history consulted for a purpuric rash on the lower limbs accompanied by arthralgias of 2 months' duration that did not subside with rest, for which Sch√∂nlein-Henoch purpura was diagnosed.
Physical examination revealed erythematous-pardusceous macules accompanied by purpuric punctation in "cayenne pepper", distributed on the lower limbs, predominantly on the pretibial region and thighs, with no plantar involvement.
Routine laboratory work-up was normal, but IgM serology for parvovirus B19 was positive.
The lesions persisted with exercise-related exacerbations and remissions for more than one year.
