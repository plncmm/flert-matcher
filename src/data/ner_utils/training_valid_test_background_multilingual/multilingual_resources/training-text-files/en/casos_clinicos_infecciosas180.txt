We present the case of a 41-year-old male with a family history of carcinoma of the larynx on his father's side and a personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia, both on dietary treatment with loss of 50 kg in the last 10 months, smoker of 40-60 cigarettes/day and user of inhaled drugs until 3 months ago. He consulted the emergency department for a right laterocervical tumour of one month's evolution that had started as a small boil, accompanied by fever of up to 40oC with sweating and shivering. The patient reported the previously mentioned weight loss associated with a change in dietary habits.
He had previously consulted the emergency department and was referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery outpatient department for an outpatient examination. An FNA was performed, which was reported as an acute inflammatory process, for which amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125mg every 8 hours was initially indicated. In the absence of improvement, on the sixth day of treatment, it was replaced by clindamycin 600mg every 8 hours, which was maintained for four days until the current emergency department visit.
Prior to the onset of the current symptoms, the patient had suffered a trauma to the foot with an open wound with a metal tool, which was currently closed, with no signs of infection.

On examination, the patient was in good general condition and was eupneic. Cardiorespiratory auscultation showed no findings. He had a 5x4 cm tumour in cervical region II, with a stony consistency, non-mobile, adhered to deep planes, with no local inflammatory signs. Examination of the oral cavity showed it to be in poor condition with extensive destruction of teeth in the fourth quadrant.
He was assessed by Otorhinolaryngology, who performed fibroscopy and found hypertrophy of the lingual tonsil and aberrant movement of the right vocal cord on inspiration, with no other findings.

The complementary tests requested from the emergency department showed a leukocytosis of 18360 cells/μL with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells and C-reactive protein of 16.85 mg/l. A CT scan of the neck with intravenous contrast showed an image of soft tissue density, poorly delimited, heterogeneous with central hypodensity and peripheral enhancement, at the level of the right submaxillary space, measuring 1 and 3 cm, with displacement of the submaxillary gland in the anterior direction and of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the posterior direction, with poor delimitation of both structures and marked infiltration of adjacent fatty planes, multiple right submaxillary and laterocervical lymphadenopathies, ovoid, with fatty hilum, reactive appearance and increased density of the subcutaneous cellular tissue and platysma. CT scan of the neck with contrast: poorly demarcated image in soft tissues with central hypodensity. With these findings, together with the results of the FNA previously performed, he was admitted to the Infectious Diseases hospital ward.

Differential diagnosis
When faced with a cervical tumour, a broad differential diagnosis is considered:

INFLAMMATORY AND INFECTIOUS PATHOLOGY
- Soft tissue
Superficial (cellulitis)
Deep (cervical abscess)
Actinomycosis
- Ludwig's angina
- Acute lymphadenitis
Bacterial (S. aureus)
Mononucleosis
CMV
Cat scratch disease
- Drug-induced lymphadenitis
Hydantoins
Penicillin
Streptomycin
Salicylates
Thiouracil
- Cervical adenopathies associated with chronic inflammatory processes
Tuberculosis
Sarcoidosis
Syphilis
HIV/AIDS infection
Toxoplasmosis
Rubella
- Inflammation of salivary glands
Obstructive sialadenitis (calculus)
Bacterial sialadenitis
Mumps virus infection
- Thyroid inflammation (acute, subacute or chronic thyroiditis)

TRAUMATISM
- Haematoma
- Pseudoaneurysm

MALFORMATIONS
- Cervical cysts and fistulas
Medial lateral
- Laryngocele
- Teratoma
- Thymic mass
- Torticollis
- Klippel-Feil Syndrome

BENIGN TUMOURS
- Fibroma
- Lipoma
- Madelung's disease
- Cystic hygroma
- Sjögren's syndrome
- Thyroid nodule
- Vascular masses (haemangioma, carotid body tumour, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm) 
- Neurinoma
- Ameloblastoma

MALIGNANT TUMOURS
- Metastatic adenopathies
- Hodgkin's lymphomas
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas
- Primary cervical carcinoma
- Primary cervical sarcoma
- Melanoma
- Metastatic tumour Head and neck carcinoma
Thyroid tumour
Salivary gland tumour
Lung tumour
Gastro-oesophageal tumour

This includes inflammatory, infectious, traumatic and neoplastic pathology.
In patients over 40 years of age, up to 60% of cases are of neoplastic aetiology, usually due to metastasis of adenocarcinoma or lymphomas. This is why, given the characteristics of the patient and the tumour, it would be the first cause to rule out.
Traumatic aetiology includes haematomas and carotid pseudoaneurysms, which usually present as a soft, pulsatile mass with a murmur on auscultation, although their extracranial location is very rare.
Inflammatory and infectious pathology is very broad. It includes soft tissue infections by common germs such as Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. as well as lymphadenopathies reactive to viral or bacterial infections of the oropharynx. Germs of the Actinomycetales order, including Corynebacterium spp., Mycobacterium spp., Nocardia spp. and Propionibacterium spp. may also manifest as cervical nodules, with a subacute or chronic course, the most frequent aetiology among these microorganisms being tuberculous. Other options to consider are sialoadenitis, toxoplasmosis and cat scratch disease.
Finally, although diagnosis of congenital malformations usually occurs in childhood, it is not uncommon that they are not detected until adulthood, especially gill cysts or thyroglossal duct cysts, in the context of superinfection.

Evolution
On admission, a serology sample was taken and was negative for HIV, syphilis, Toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus, revealing past infection by Epstein-Barr virus and parvovirus. Interferon gamma (Quantiferon®) was also determined and was positive with a titre of 3.85 IU/mL (normal value <0.35 IU/mL). A chest X-ray was performed, showing no infiltrates, condensations or lesions suggestive of tuberculosis. A core needle biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance, and 10cc of purulent content was aspirated and sent to microbiology for culture of the usual germs and mycobacteria, and also to anatomical pathology. In the study for mycobacteria, with auramine staining, no acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were visualised. PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was performed and was negative, with the results of the mycobacterial culture still pending. The Gram stain showed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive cocci, so empirical treatment was started with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at a dose of 800/160mg every 8 hours intravenously, on suspicion of possible nocardiosis, and benzylpenicillin at a dose of 2 million IU every 4 hours.
The combined treatment was maintained for 7 days until a culture was received, in which Actinomyces odontolyticus and Streptococcus oralis were isolated, after which cotrimoxazole was discontinued and benzylpenicillin was maintained. After the diagnosis of actinomycosis, Maxillofacial Surgery performed drainage of the tumour with the outflow of abundant pus and brownish granules, similar to sulphur, characteristic of Actinomyces spp. infection, leaving a "Penrose" drain, which was maintained for 10 days.
Both the biopsy cytology and the tissue sample taken during the drainage showed necrotic material with neutrophilic exudate and the presence of abundant bacterial colonies, without identifying tumour cells.
The patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged with home treatment with intravenous Penicillin G sodium 2MUI every 4 hours in the TADE programme (Endovenous Home Antibiotic Treatment). He completed six weeks of intravenous treatment and was subsequently treated for a further four months with amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours, with a good clinical evolution.

Final diagnosis
Cervicofacial actinomycosis with Streptococcus oralis superinfection.
