A 71-year-old patient, with a history of mycosis fungoides under treatment, consulted for abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea of one week's evolution with a weight loss of 10kg. Examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalised pain on palpation, predominantly in the right iliac fossa, with no signs of peritoneal irritation.

In view of the patient's poor clinical condition, it was decided to perform an abdominal CT scan. This identified circumferential thickening of a long segment of the distal ileum, with dilatation of the lumen, associated with extension to the adjacent mesenteric fatty tissue. Sigma, terminal ileum and descending colon appear collapsed with dilated proximal small bowel loops. In addition, in the right iliac fossa, a 6 cm adenopathic conglomerate is identified in continuity with the described mass. These findings are indicative of small bowel obstruction at the level of the ileum secondary to mass growth in the pelvis.

Given the finding of an intestinal mass, epidemiologically, adenocarcinoma is the first possibility. However, the form of presentation in the form of circumferential thickening, with homogeneous density and producing dilatation of the intestinal wall, are typical radiological characteristics of intestinal lymphoma. Also, in contrast to adenocarcinoma, these neoplasms frequently involve regional lymph nodes. Although it is true that lymphomas do not usually cause obstruction until advanced stages, the semiological characteristics described, together with the patient's history of mycosis fungoides, supported the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma as a first possibility. Subsequently, the anatomical pathology study confirmed our suspicion.
