Anamnesis
65-year-old woman with a dubious history of photosensitivity and arthralgias without arthritis of large joints without regular medication. She had required H. pylori eradication treatment for gastritis. A few weeks after completing triple OCA therapy (Omeprazole, Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin) she developed a skin rash for which she consulted.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed a symmetrical generalised exanthematous dermatosis of greater intensity on the back, neck, back of the arms and lower limbs characterised by annular macular lesions, some of them dianiform, reminiscent of erythema multiforme (EM), with a tendency to confluence. It was accompanied by palmar involvement. There were no other accompanying symptoms or mucosal involvement. Over the course of a week the lesions converged to form large annular-polycyclic plaques.

Complementary examinations
A blood test with autoimmunity determination was performed, highlighting the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) >1/160 with a mottled pattern, positive anti-ENA with positive anti-Ro/SSA and positive anti-LA/SSB. Anti-histone, rheumatoid factor and complement were negative.
A sample was taken for pathological examination showing an interface dermatitis with basal vacuolar damage and the presence of numerous eosinophils in the dermis compatible with MS or Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE).

Diagnosis
Rowell's Syndrome/ Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Erythematosus Drug-induced

Treatment
Antihistamine treatment was started on demand together with oral prednisone 40 mg/24 h with a subsequent tapering pattern.

Evolution
Over the following weeks the lesions gradually resolved and progressed to scaly and hyperpigmented forms with a residual appearance. During one year of follow-up the patient did not present new outbreaks although the antibodies remained positive.
