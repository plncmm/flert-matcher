An 80 year old woman with anterior cervical pain, which started three days after FNA of a thyroid cyst. Seven days later, she consulted for worsening of the symptoms with the appearance of dysphagia, fever and anterior cervical redness, having started amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125) in the previous 24 hours. EF: redness and swelling in the anterior cervical region. Leukocytes 9,200 (79.3% N), ESR 73, Cr 1.26, GFR 40, CRP 296.6 ECO-PAAF LTI: cyst with two phases, one anechogenic (liquid) which on aspiration corresponds to chocolate liquid and another phase, in a declining area, slightly echogenic with thicker liquid with a "caf√© au lait" colour. AP: red blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and minimal material compatible with colloid. Aerobic and anaerobic culture: negative. No microorganisms were observed in the GRAM stain. The patient was treated with empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotherapy (meropenem 1 g/8h plus linezolid 600 mg/12h) for 14 days, followed by another 14 days orally (ciprofloxacin 500 mg/12h plus metronidazole 500 mg/8h).
