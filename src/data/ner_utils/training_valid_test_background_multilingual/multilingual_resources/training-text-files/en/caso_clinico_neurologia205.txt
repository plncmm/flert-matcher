Anamnesis
A 45-year-old woman presented since the age of 7 years with episodes of intense headache that was usually haemicranial, without aura, with nausea and vomiting, with photo- and sonophobia, which could last for 24 to 48 hours. Surgical history: thymectomy for multinodular goitre. Usual treatment with levothyroxine 75 mg, topiramate 50 mg and zolmitriptan 5 mg if migraine crisis. The patient came to the hospital because in the last week she presented with a headache different from the usual ones, with right retroocular pain and holocranial "helmet" headache and associated with right pulsatile tinnitus days after cervical manipulation due to muscle contractures.

Physical examination
Afebrile, blood pressure 110/80 mmHg. Good general condition, normal speech. No meningeal signs. PICNR, normal cranial nerves, normoreactive isochoric pupils, normal ocular motility, normal confrontation visual fields. Normal fundus. Normal strength, sensibility and coordination. Osteotendinous reflexes present. Bilateral indifferent cutaneous-plantar reflex. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation, absence of carotid murmurs. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

Complementary tests
- CBC with normal haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation, normal thyroid hormones, vitamin B12 and folic acid. Negative blood serologies for HIV, syphilis and Lyme disease. Normal hypercoagulability and autoimmunity studies.
- ECG: sinus rhythm without significant alterations.
- Chest X-ray: normal.
- Echo-Doppler of supra-aortic trunks: intima-media thickness of 0.7 mm within the normal range without atheroma plaques. Flattening of the wave in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) of very low velocity to assess distal stenosis or occlusion. Normal flow in the left internal carotid artery. Bilateral vertebral arteries visible with antegrade flows.
- MRI and cranial angio-MRI: no structural alterations or pathological signs at the level of the supra- or infratentorial brain parenchyma. Absence of flow in the right supracondylar internal carotid artery, as well as in the ipsilateral A1 and M1 segments with distal flows present, both posterior communicating segments functioning.
- Angio-CT of supra-aortic and intracranial trunks: total obstruction of the right ICA in its intracranial cavernous segment, with distal repermeabilisation from the collateral circulation of the polygon of Willis. The rest of the cervical proximal tract of the right ICA is of normal morphology and calibre. The rest of the supra-aortic trunks are of normal morphology and calibre. No alterations in the rest of the intracranial arteries.
- Cerebral arteriography: origin of the left common carotid artery in the right trunk as an anatomical variant without pathological significance. Critical stenosis in a segment of about 2 cm of the right intracavernous internal carotid artery; the lesion has an irregular appearance with discrete irregularity and ectasia of the pre-stenotic portion, it could be a dissection, and although the flow is slowed, it fills the middle cerebral circulation correctly from the same side. Left internal carotid artery without lesions. Permeable anterior communicating artery. Vertebrobasilar sector without lesions. Cerebral angiography: critical stenosis of the right internal carotid intracavernous; the lesion has an irregular appearance and ectasia of the pre-stenotic portion suggestive of dissection.

Diagnosis
Headache secondary to intracranial carotid dissection.

Treatment
The patient was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day, which she continues to receive on a daily basis, together with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. During her admission she required treatment with NSAIDs until the headache subsided. On discharge, treatment was indicated with amitriptyline 25 mg per day and zolmitriptan 5 mg if migraine attacks occurred, together with ibuprofen and occasional tetrazepam for pain in the cervical muscles.

Progress
During the first few days of admission, the patient presented with a tension-type headache that subsided with NSAIDs; after 3 days the pulsating tinnitus disappeared and the hemicranial headache began again, similar to her usual migraine. She was re-evaluated one month and 3 months after admission. The patient continued with migraine attacks without retroocular pain or tinnitus, at least once a week lasting up to 2-3 days, as well as episodes of arterial hypertension in the context of stress, so amitriptyline was discontinued and topiramate and nadolol were introduced. The follow-up MRI angiography at 3 months showed a slight irregularity of the wall and discrete stenosis in the cavernous tract of the right ICA, without observing the absence of flow or obstruction that existed in the previous study. No dissection was observed. The rest of the intracranial arteries and supra-aortic trunks of normal morphology and calibre, without significant stenosis. Evolution by angio-MRI on admission and at 3 months: disappearance of the critical stenosis without aneurysms or other associated lesions.
