Reason for consultation
Hyperemesis.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests).
A 27-year-old male patient, with no relevant history except for habitual cannabis consumption of about 10cig/day, no other intoxicants, who came to the Accident and Emergency Department because he had been presenting for 24 hours with epigastric pain, not radiating, accompanied by incoercible vomiting (approximately one every half hour), which did not subside despite taking antiemetics at home. She reported no alterations in stool habits, fever or other clinical manifestations in the anamnesis by apparatus. For the last 5 months, she reported episodes of similar characteristics, of lesser intensity, self-limited over time and unable to attribute them to a specific cause.

Good general condition. Conscious and oriented in the three spheres. Eupneic at rest. Afebrile. ACR: rhythmic tones without murmurs. MVC preserved, without added pathological sounds. Abdomen: soft, depressible, painful on epigastric palpation with discrete reactive defence to pain, preserved hydroaerial sounds. No masses or megaliths. No ascites or peritonism.
Analysis with biliary profile and abdominal ultrasound: no alterations.

Family and community approach
Poor family support. She goes alone to the emergency department.

Clinical judgement (list of problems, differential diagnosis)
Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.

Action plan and evolution
The patient was advised to take a hot shower, after which he reported that the symptoms subsided and began to show considerable improvement.
He was discharged home with frequent hot showers and complete abstinence from cannabis.
