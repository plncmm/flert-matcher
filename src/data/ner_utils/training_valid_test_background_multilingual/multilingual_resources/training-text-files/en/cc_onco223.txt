Anamnesis
65-year-old woman with intolerance to tramadol and admission to ICU in August 2007 due to urinary sepsis caused by Escherichia coli. Previous surgical interventions: fixation of dorsal spine due to kyphoscoliosis.
Diagnosed in January 2008 by thoracic CT scan, PET scan, bronchoscopy and subsequent left upper lobectomy with lymphadenectomy of lung adenocarcinoma pT2pN0 (0/8) M0.
Follow-up, with no evidence of disease, until September 11, when recurrence was documented by PET/CT in the form of two pulmonary nodules on which FNA was performed with an anatomopathological report of adenocarcinoma. In view of this, a left pneumonectomy plus lymphadenectomy was performed with an anatomopathological report of 2.4 cm well-differentiated adenocarcinoma that respects visceral pleura and surgical edges, without lymph node involvement and mutated EGFR.
In February 13 a recurrence was observed in the form of a pulmonary nodule in the LSD together with right lower paratracheal adenopathy. Given the risk of complications, a new biopsy was ruled out and Gefitinib was indicated at the usual doses, 250 mg daily, with a complete radiological response, both by CT and PET, and with excellent tolerance.
During follow-up, and being totally asymptomatic, pathological uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes was detected by PET in December 15.

Physical examination
-Blood pressure 125/75 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats/min, temperature 37o C, oxygen saturation 97%.
-Conscious and oriented in 3 spheres. Non-hydrated, normoperfused and normo coloured. Eupneic at rest. IK 80
-Head and neck: jugular venous pressure normal, no adenopathy.
-Chest: cardiac auscultation: rhythmic without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: hypoventilation left hemifield. Scars from previous interventions correct
-Abdomen: Soft, not painful. Positive hydroaerial sounds.
-Lower extremities: No oedema. Positive paedial sounds.

Complementary tests
-PET(December-2015): hypermetabolism in adenopathies located in high and low right paratracheal region (Suv 8.14), prevascular (Suv 3.45), aortopulmonary window (Suv 7.99) and right hilum (Suv 7.46), suggesting recurrence of the disease.
-EBUS 4R and 4L: smear negative for malignant cells. Lymph node with granulomatous structures without necrosis.
-Mediastinoscopy 4R, 4L and 2L: granulomatous epithelioid lymphadenitis compatible with Sarcoidosis.

Diagnosis
-Mediastinal sarcoidosis
-Lung adenocarcinoma of lung with EGFR mutated lymph node recurrence in complete response to Gefitinib

Treatment
Given the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and the absence of systemic involvement and the fact that the patient was completely asymptomatic, a wait-and-see approach to treatment was adopted and follow-up was decided.
With regard to treatment of the neoplasm, it was decided to maintain treatment with Gefitinib given the excellent response and tolerance.

Evolution
In view of the PET findings, and the patient being completely asymptomatic, it was decided to complete the study by EBUS and later mediastinoscopy, in order to determine whether or not there was a recurrence. Curiously, the anatomopathological study did not show the presence of malignant cells, but rather the opposite, an inflammatory process, such as sarcoidosis. This allowed us to maintain treatment with Gefitinib for our patient, who still maintains a complete response to this day.
