A 59-year-old man with a history of psoriasis, on treatment with topical Betamethasone with no known drug allergies, smoker, who works as a farmer. The patient reports that he has been bitten by ticks on his legs on a few occasions. Ten years ago, in the context of a tick bite, he had an episode of fever and general malaise, but does not recall atypical skin lesions other than those typical of psoriasis. Since then, she reported clinical manifestations of left facial paralysis. Follow-up ophthalmology consultations due to sudden loss of visual acuity in the right eye since the end of April led to a diagnosis of posterior uveitis, treated with prednisone 30 mg and topical dexamethasone.
Ophthalmology referred the patient to Internal Medicine for further investigation. The differential diagnosis of unilateral posterior uveitis is broad, initially ruling out the possibility of an infectious aetiology, fundamentally syphilis, TB, Herpes, Toxoplasmosis or secondary systemic autoimmune diseases (SLE, sarcoidosis, etc.), for which reason the following complementary tests were requested:
- Haemogram: Hb12.3, leucocytes 10.77 with 74% neutrophils, platelets 400,000 - Biochemistry: creatinine 0.8, PCR 9.2.
- Mantoux negative
- Chest X-ray: bilateral interstitial infiltrate.
- ECG: in sinus rhythm, with systolic overload.
- RCT, C3 and C4 normal, RF 7.6 IU/ml, HLAB27, ANCA and ANA negative.
- Serology: IgG+ for toxoplasma and a very positive IgG+ result for Borrelia Burgdorferi which was later confirmed by Western Blot test at the reference microbiological centre.
During her admission, a cranial MRI was performed, which showed no CNS lesions and lumbar puncture, extracting 3 cc of clear CSF whose biochemical analysis showed pleocytosis of 92.5 mg/dl and positive IgG serology for Borrelia Burgdorferi, confirming the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis with involvement of the VII pair and associated uveitis. He was treated for 28 days, 2 weeks with intravenous Ceftriaxone 2g and 2 weeks with oral Doxycycline (100 mg / 12h).
It should be remembered that the most frequent manifestation of Lyme disease in our environment is facial paralysis, erythema chronicum migrans and painful meningoradiculitis, with posterior uveitis being uncommon.
