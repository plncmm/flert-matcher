A 24-year-old male from Cameroon, resident in Spain for 6 years, who has been travelling to his country once a year, came to the emergency department with a sensation of a mobile foreign body in his right eye.

The patient reported the presence of a worm intermittently in both eyes for the last 5 years, sometimes recognising it under the eyelid skin, for which reason he had consulted the general emergency department on several occasions.

Examination of the anterior pole revealed the existence of a corded, mobile structure that crawled under the upper bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye. In view of the findings, a 5 cm long intact worm was surgically removed under local anaesthesia.

The microbiological study confirms the diagnosis of Loa Loa in its adult form (female).
