A 49-year-old parental drug user, with a history of chronic hepatopathy due to HCV and indefinite anticoagulation due to repeated deep vein thrombosis, who came to the emergency department for cervicalgia of one week's duration radiating to the 5th finger of the right arm with a previous episode of fever of 38oC and recent venipuncture. In the anamnesis she denied any infectious focus and her physical examination was anodyne. He had previously consulted for this reason and was discharged with symptomatic treatment. Despite this, he reported clinical worsening and showed an increase in acute phase reactants, so he was admitted for empirical treatment with ceftazidime and cloxacillin. HIV serology was negative. However, Serratia marcescens was isolated in 2/3 blood cultures, so antibiogram-directed treatment was started with cefepime, later changed to ertapenem on the advice of microbiology. An MRI was requested which showed extradural spinal cord compression at C5-C6 level due to an anterior epidural abscess with signs of incipient spondylodiscitis and an abscessed prevertebral collection from C3 to C6-C7. For this reason, neurosurgical assessment was requested, which ruled out intervention as there were no clinical signs of spinal cord compression at that time. During admission, the patient showed progressive symptomatic improvement, with less pain and a subjective increase in strength in both arms. Control blood cultures were sterile. Given the good evolution, after 3 weeks of targeted intravenous antibiotherapy, he was discharged with oral fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin until completing 6 weeks of treatment. Radiological control at 2 and 5 months confirmed the resolution of the abscess without signs of myelopathy.
