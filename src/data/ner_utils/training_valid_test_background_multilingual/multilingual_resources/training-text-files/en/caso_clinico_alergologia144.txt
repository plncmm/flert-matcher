A 16-year-old male, with a history of anaphylaxis due to peanut, presented with anaphylaxis after ingestion of fenugreek. Prick: Peanut 10x20 mm, Natural fenugreek 6x8 mm, Lentil 2 mm, Soya bean 2 mm, Bean negative, Histamine 5 mm. Serum specific IgE values: Peanut 84 kU/L (Ara h1 34.5 kU/L, Ara h2 60.9 kU/L, Ara h3 2.41 kU/L, Ara h 8 0.03 KU/L and Ara h9 0.05 kU/L), Fenugreek >17.5 kU/L, Curry 16.9 kU/L, Lentil 1.67 kU/L, Soya bean 2.65 kU/L, Bean 0.04 kU/L. Molecular mass study of specific IgE binding proteins (SDS-PAGE-Immunoblotting): Peanut extract (raw and roasted): 75 kDa, 63 kDa,21 kDa and 19 kDa. Fenugreek extract: banding between approximately > 97kDa-30 kDa, 21 kDa and 19 kDa. Cross-reactivity study by SDA-PAGE-Immunoblotting-inhibition technique with solid phase fenugreek extract: Raw and roasted peanut extracts completely inhibit IgE binding in fenugreek extract. Fenugreek extract does not inhibit IgE binding of itself. Interpretation of the study: 63 kDa band detected in peanut extract could correspond to 7S Ara h 1 globulin. 21 and 19 kDa bands detected in peanut extract could correspond to 2S Ara h 2.01 and Ara 2.02 albumins, bands of the same molecular mass are observed in fenugreek extract. It is shown that in patient serum there are IgEs cross-reacting with fenugreek and peanut proteins.
