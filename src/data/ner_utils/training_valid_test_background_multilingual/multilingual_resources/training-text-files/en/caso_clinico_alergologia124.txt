A 9-year-old boy, with no family or personal history of interest, consulted the Paediatric Emergency Department of our centre for vesicular lesions on the outer face of the right arm, in the area where a henna tattoo (from the Lawsonia inermis plant) had been applied. The patient reported that the tattoo had been applied 15 days earlier, with onset of the symptoms 48 hours prior to the consultation. He had been receiving treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid since the onset of the symptoms, indicated in outpatients due to suspicion of superinfection. At the time of the emergency department assessment, treatment was prescribed with Silvederma, oral methylprednisolone and hydroxyzine, with progressive improvement over the following week.
He was subsequently assessed at the paediatric allergy clinic, where hypopigmentation was observed in the area where the tattoo had been applied. A true-test was performed with readings at 48 and 96 hours, with a positive response to paraphenylenediamine.
