A 29-year-old man, with a history of several attempts at autolysis, came to the emergency department with dizziness, blurred vision, liquid diarrhoea, nausea, sweating and trembling, 48 hours after having ingested an infusion of Nerium oleander.
Physical examination revealed a good general condition, afebrile, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg and heart rate 130 bpm. Cardiac auscultation showed sinus tachycardia. The electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia with negative T waves on the anterolateral side. Haemogram, platelets, coagulation and blood biochemistry were normal. Plasma digoxin levels were measured and the result was 0.67 ng/mL. The patient was admitted and, at the request of the pharmacy service, two more digoxin levels were performed 24 and 48 hours after admission, the results of which were 0.6 and 0.55 ng/mL, respectively. For these concentrations, an elimination half-life of 138.2 h was calculated, and a theoretical maximum plasma concentration of 0.85 ng/mL after intake of the oleander infusion. At discharge, four days after admission, the patient had had a daily soft stool for two days and a normal heart rhythm.
