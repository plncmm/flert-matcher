A 32-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with acute binocular horizontal diplopia on awakening after 3 days of progressive respiratory symptoms. He reported no pain with eye movement and no other neurological symptoms such as weakness, gait abnormalities, paraesthesia or anosmia. Over the following week, his respiratory symptoms worsened, and he was hospitalised for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure after testing positive for COVID-19. He followed a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and oxygen therapy; his respiratory symptoms subsided over the next three weeks. At the time of ophthalmological evaluation at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, 5 weeks after the onset of diplopia, he reported no change in double vision. On examination, his best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Intraocular pressure was normal and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Ocular motility examination revealed left esotropia of 35Δ in primary gaze, 4Δ in right gaze and 60Δ in left gaze. There was complete limitation of abduction in the left eye, consistent with a diagnosis of left ocular motor nerve palsy. Examination of the optic nerve was irrelevant. There was no hypoaesthesia in the ophthalmic or maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. MRI was performed and revealed atrophy of the left external rectus muscle, hyperintense on T2. The patient was prescribed monocular occlusion for relief of diplopia and was scheduled for a follow-up visit.
