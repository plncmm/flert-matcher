Female preschooler aged 4 years, with no significant personal history, except for vaccination with rescue vaccination at 18 months (not previously immunised, negative parental immunisation), she had not received pneumococcus or non-financed vaccines.

She presented 24 hours after administration of MenjugateÂ® (conjugate vaccine to CRM197 against group C meningococcus) with purplish erythematous lesions, > 3 cm, pelvis, lower limbs and distal area of upper limbs, mild pruritus without angioedema. In the emergency department, local oedema at the vaccination site and palpable purpuric lesions, negative vitropressure and discrete oedema in the distal thirds, no mucosal lesions. Haemogram and biochemistry normal. Improvement in 2 weeks, with slight desquamation and no residual lesions.

The patient reported fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and weakness 48 hours before the vaccination; he received paracetamol, which he tolerated until the episode, and has avoided since then.

A drug study was performed, ruling out hypersensitivity to paracetamol, prick skin tests for Menjugate, aluminium hydroxide and latex were negative (15 min and late readings: 24, 48, 72 hours). Serology during acute episode IgM positive for Epstein-Barr virus and undetermined Parvovirus B19. During the review 2 months after the episode: IgG low avidity Positive 50% and IgG parvovirus negative. Diagnosis: Papulo purpuric glove-sock syndrome (PPGS).
