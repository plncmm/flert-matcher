A 45-year-old African-American woman, forty-five years old, 40 weeks and 2 days gestation, presented to the service on 25 March 2020 with contractions and vomiting. The patient had a history of two term vaginal deliveries and diet-controlled gestational diabetes (GDMA1). Her body mass index (BMI) was 44.6 kg/m2. Her medical history was only relevant in terms of obesity and advanced age of pregnancy. Her only medication was daily prenatal vitamins. The patient had no known contact with COVID-19 cases and had not travelled outside the United States during the past month. She was noted to be tachycardic with a pulse of 120 bpm, fetal tachycardia with a baseline fetal pulse of 170 bpm and a baseline temperature of 37.5°C. She was admitted with hydration and hydration. She was admitted with i.v. hydration and prolonged monitoring. Two hours after admission, the patient's temperature rose to 38.2°C and radiological tests revealed pulmonary oedema and ground-glass appearance. Six hours after the initial consultation, the patient presented with severe hypertension at both limits, with a pressure of 183/114 mm Hg, pulse 130 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 bpm, temperature of 38.1°C and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. Taking into account the extreme blood pressure, a pre-eclampsia profile was done which revealed proteinuria of 1+, thrombocytes of 274,000 per mcL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 32 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 24 IU/L. A diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was made and treatment with magnesium sulphate was started to prevent possible crises. The patient's respiratory rate increased to 40 r.p.m. and SpO2 decreased to 80% with nasal cannula oxygen therapy. After discussion with the departments of maternal-fetal medicine, anaesthesia, general obstetrics and gynaecology and cardiology, it was decided to remove the foetus to allow maternal resuscitation. A caesarean section was performed 7.5 hours after the initial consultation, on 26 March 2020. On day 0 post-operatively, maternal arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, pO2 of 117 mm Hg, HCO3 of 16 mEq/L and a base excess (BE) of-11 mmol/L. A follow-up chest X-ray revealed small bilateral peripheral opacities, with a differential diagnosis including atypical pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Because of suspected congestive heart failure, magnesium sulphate was withdrawn and i.v. furosemide was administered. Cardiology was consulted for an echocardiogram, which showed a reduced LV ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesia; the patient was diagnosed with acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Taking into account the clinical picture of fever, tachypnoea and chest X-ray findings, against the background of a pandemic, a GeneXpert PCR test for COVID-19 RNA was performed and was positive. Additional analytical tests found normal troponin (0.046 ng/mL), brain natriuretic peptide (114 pg/mL, normal < 100 pg/mL) and procalcitonin (0.13 ng/mL, normal < 0.10 ng/mL). On postoperative day 4, chest X-ray showed worsening bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and, despite oxygen therapy, SpO2 could not be maintained above 90%. An electrocardiogram was performed, which revealed non-specific T-wave alterations in an otherwise normal ECG, with a QT/QTc of 354/465 ms (both normal). Serum potassium was 3.7 mEq/L (normal). The patient's condition did not improve and treatment was started with 60 mg i.v. methylprednisolone every 3 hours and 400 mg hydroxychloroquine orally every 12 hours for 24 hours, followed by 400 mg orally per day. That same afternoon, after administration of the initial doses, she started desaturating at 86% with 6 L via nasal cannula. Maternal arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.07, pCO2 of 75 mm Hg, pO2 of 85 mm Hg, HCO3 of 21.7 mEq/L and a base excess of-2 mmol/L. She was placed on a 15 L reservoir mask, which initially improved SpO2 to 90% and on postoperative day 4 she was started on 100 mg i.v. methylprednisolone per day. On postoperative day 5 the patient desaturated again to 80%. Since our institutional protocol on COVID-19 advises to avoid non-invasive mechanical ventilation that could aerosolise viral particles, the patient was intubated under anaesthesia, but no improvement was observed. Pulse rate dropped to about 30 l.p.m. and the patient presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started and return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after five minutes of CPR. After arrest, his troponin value reached 0.930 ng/mL (normal < 0.4 ng/mL), with a brain natriuretic peptide of 323 pg/mL. After CPR, i.v. norepinephrine treatment was started, initially at 8 mcg/min, with dose titration up to 20 mcg/min. A dose of 800 mg i.v. tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, was administered. At the time of writing (2 April 2020), the patient is on postoperative day 7 and remains intubated and ventilated in the intensive care unit, awake and showing movement in all 4 limbs; SpO2 is 96% and i.v. infusion of norepinephrine at 20 mcg/min, i.v. methylprednisolone at 100 mg per day and oral hydroxychloroquine at 400 mg per day is being maintained. The most relevant values of the analytical tests are troponin at 0.046 ng/mL and a marked increase in procalcitonin at 48.21 ng/mL.
