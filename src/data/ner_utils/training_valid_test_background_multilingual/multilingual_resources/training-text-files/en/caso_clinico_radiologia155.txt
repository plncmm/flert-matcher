We discuss the clinical case of a 42-year-old woman, with a history of caesarean section one month ago, referred to the emergency department to rule out acute appendicitis, presenting with abdominal pain in FID and vomiting for 24 hours of evolution. Physical examination revealed fever with signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated CRP (286 mg/l).

An emergency abdominal ultrasound was performed, complemented by MDCT with IV contrast, showing a marked increase in free fluid in the right iliac fossa and left parietocolic gutter, as well as a well-defined retroperitoneal tubular structure with central hypodensity and the presence of peripheral annular contrast uptake, running parallel to the vena cava, inferior to the psoas and right ureter and medial to the ipsilateral kidney. There is also discrete contrast uptake through the right fallopian tube and oedematous uterus (without being able to rule out that this oedema is secondary to a recent surgical history). Findings suggestive in the clinical context of the patient of thrombosis of the right ovarian vein and possible inflammatory/infectious process at pelvic level (PID). Given the findings, the patient was referred to the gynaecological emergency department, where a transvaginal ultrasound was performed, which was normal. Medical treatment was started with anticoagulation and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, with a favourable clinical evolution 48 hours after starting treatment.
