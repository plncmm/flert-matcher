Male patient, 42 years old, with no significant history of morbidity, who suffers an accident at work while driving a forklift, when he drives over a rock with his vehicle, receiving a blow and axial compression in the lumbar region, after which he suffers pain in the aforementioned area.

He was hospitalised and the pain was controlled medically, which partially subsided. On the fourth day, she presented with a fever associated with a compromised general condition, for which a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lumbar spine was performed, which was not available; it showed central extruded herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) L5-S1 associated with an organised collection in the same space and significant compression of the dural sac.

The evolution of the laboratory tests is shown in the table in the appendix. Initially, HSV: 77 mm, CRP of 243.05 and leucocytes 4,600 with a left shift were observed, and empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone, metronidazole and gentamicin; fever dropped 48 hours after starting antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures isolated Staphylococcus aureus (SAMS) sensitive to cloxacillin, so antibiotic treatment was modified to cloxacillin 2 g c/6 ev plus cefazolin 1g c/8 ev, completing 20 days with this scheme.

Three weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient was referred to our centre for management by the spine team. A new MRI of the lumbar spine was performed, showing an image compatible with a posterior peridural abscess which, when analysed in relation to the previous images, suggested that it was initially a haematoma related to a traumatic L5-S1 PNH, which subsequently became infected.

Intravenous antibiotic treatment was maintained, ruling out the surgical option because the patient evolved afebrile and asymptomatic from the neurological point of view, being discharged without neurological deficit, with inflammatory parameters in clear decrease after completing 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment, with oral scheme of cefadroxil 1 g c/12, for 4 weeks.
