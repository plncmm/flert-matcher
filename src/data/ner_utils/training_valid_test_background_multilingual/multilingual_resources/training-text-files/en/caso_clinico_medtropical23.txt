A 34-year-old man from Spain, with no epidemiological history of visits to endemic areas of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), bone marrow transplant due to idiopathic bone marrow aplasia after HBV hepatitis. The patient showed poor response to treatment with frequent transfusion requirements and 21 days post-transplant developed acute skin symptoms characterised by erythematous plaques with geographic borders and multiple hyperpigmented papules on the face, posterior cervical region and back. A punch skin biopsy was submitted with suspicion of GVHD. Histopathology of the skin biopsy revealed abundant intra- and extracellular spherical parasites (amastigotes), which were initially interpreted as Leishmania or a related parasite. Fresh peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspirate demonstrate the presence of abundant flagellated pyriform forms (trypomastigotes) characteristic of Trypanosoma cruzi. A bone marrow cylinder biopsy was performed including a small fragment of skeletal muscle, with marrow hypoplasia and intracellular muscle parasitism by T. cruzi amastigotes. On day 35 post-transplant, the patient presented retinal haemorrhages with soft exudates within the clinical picture of trypanosomiasis. After serological and PCR confirmation of T. cruzi infection, treatment with benznidazole was started with progressive clinical improvement. The patient underwent an exhaustive epidemiological study and it was concluded that the route of transmission of the infection must have been one of the multiple transfusions received.
