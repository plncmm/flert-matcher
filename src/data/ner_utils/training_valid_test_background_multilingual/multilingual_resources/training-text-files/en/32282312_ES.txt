An otherwise healthy 20-year-old man presented to an emergency department with fever and rash. He was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and sent home with symptomatic treatment. Six days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with persistent fever and rash. Vital signs were: temperature 39.4°C, pulse 115 bpm, blood pressure 93/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 bpm and oxygen saturation 91%. Physical examination revealed a generalised morbilliform rash on the trunk and extremities, without facial involvement. There was no mucosal or ocular involvement. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count (8300 units per litre [uL], reference range 4200-9100/uL) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 800/uL (reference range 1300-3600/uL). The C-reactive protein value was high at 118.5 mg/L (reference range 0-5 mg/L). A rapid streptococcal and human immunodeficiency virus test were both negative, as was a respiratory viral profile. The patient required increasingly higher oxygen therapy during his ED evolution and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive on day 2 of hospitalisation. The patient remains in the ICU on day 6 of hospitalisation.
