Anamnesis
A 42-year-old male, Ecuadorian, came to the emergency department for frontal and left periorbital headache, of one week's evolution, lasting 3-5 minutes and with five episodes per day, of increasing intensity and frequency, without photophobia, rhinorrhoea, lacrimation, or modification after Valsalva manoeuvres. It was progressively accompanied by diplopia when looking horizontally to the left, as well as upper and middle left facial hypoaesthesia, and during his admission he also presented hypoaesthesia and paresis of the mandibular musculature, as well as complete left facial paralysis, without fever or other systemic or neurological symptoms.
Her personal history included no cerebrovascular risk factors, but there was an episode similar to the current one of headache and diplopia 5 years earlier, for which she attended another hospital, without a clear diagnosis, which resolved completely. He had been living in Spain for 15 years, the last trip to his country of origin being 3 years ago. He worked in construction. Father died of stroke. She reported no intake of toxic substances, drugs or herbal products.

Physical examination
Conscious and oriented in all three spheres. Well hydrated and nourished. Temperature 36.8 oC, blood pressure 140/96 mmHg, heart rate 64 bpm. Good distal perfusion. Eupneic. Absence of cutaneous-mucosal lesions. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive to light, no meningismus. Fundus of the eyes without alterations. Paresis of the VI nerve, with hypoaesthesia in the V1,V2,V3 territory, paresis of the mandibular musculature and ipsilateral upper and lower facial paralysis on the left side, with no other alterations. Strength and sensibility in all its modalities symmetrically preserved in all four extremities. Symmetrical and normoactive myotatic reflexes, with bilateral flexor plantar cutaneous reflex. Coordination, posture and gait within normal limits.

Complementary tests
- General biochemistry, haemogram, coagulation, autoimmunity, CRP, ESR, electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic spectrum, angiotensin converting enzyme, tumour markers, urine sediment, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were performed without alterations.
- Lumbar puncture: opening pressure 14 cm of water. Crystal clear fluid, no blockages. Cerebrospinal fluid cytobiochemistry within normal limits, flow cytometry and cytology negative for malignant cells. Normal CSF IgG index and absence of oligoclonal bands.
- Microbiology: negative serology for syphilis, HIV, Borrelia, hepatotropic viruses. Mantoux negative. Sputum BAAR negative.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT) (without contrast): asymmetry in the region of the left cavernous sinus compared to the right, as well as mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus. Axial cranial CT scan without contrast. 1B. Axial cranial T1-weighted MRI with fat-suppressed contrast. There is a hyperdense image in the left cavernous sinus that picks up contrast on MRI.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without and with contrast: there is thickening of the left cavernous sinus region, which appears isointense in T2 and with homogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. It is associated with thickening and uptake of the dura covering the base of the left temporal lobe, as well as the free edge of the tentorium. There is also thickening and uptake of the left cranial nerve V at its exit through the foramen ovale, without involvement of perineural structures. Coronal cranial MRI coronal T1 with contrast and fat suppression. Pre-treatment. Two months post-treatment. Decreased uptake in the cavernous sinus and dura mater overlying the base of the temporal lobe.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan: no alterations.
- PET-CT scan: bilateral and symmetrical increase in metabolic activity in the palatine tonsils, of an inflammatory-infectious nature. No adenopathy with metabolic activity or other foci suggesting abnormal metabolic activity were observed.
- Bilateral tonsillar biopsy: no findings of malignant cells.

Diagnosis
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.

Treatment
Treatment was started with non-steroidal analgesics and prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for a week, with good response, and continued with a stepwise descending regimen.

Evolution
Improvement of the headache and cranial nerve involvement, resolving completely. Successive radiological controls were carried out by means of cranial MRI which showed a significant decrease in the size of the lesions.
