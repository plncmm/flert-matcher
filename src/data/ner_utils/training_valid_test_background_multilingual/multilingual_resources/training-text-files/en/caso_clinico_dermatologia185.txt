Anamnesis
A 53-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension, he is a goatherd by profession; his work consists not only of looking after and milking the goats but also of making goat's cheese. He takes enalapril as a regular treatment.
He reports the appearance 7 days ago of an asymptomatic lesion on the dorsum of the palm of the right hand, with progressive growth. Subsequently, for the last 2 days, he has had a similar lesion on the dorsum of the second finger of the contralateral hand, but of a smaller size. She had no fever or other symptoms.

Physical examination
Examination revealed a violaceous nodule measuring 2.5 centimetres in diameter, with a slight perilesional erythema and some ulcerated area on the palm of the right hand, which did not fluctuate or ooze. Slight discomfort on palpation. On the lateral aspect of the second finger of the left hand there was a lesion of the same characteristics, but smaller in size.

Complementary examinations
A skin biopsy was performed showing epidermal necrosis with proliferation in the dermis of numerous vessels and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. A sample was sent to microbiology, where particles of the parapoxvirus genus were identified by electron microscopy.

Diagnosis
Orf's nodule.

Treatment
Given the scarce symptomatology, it was decided not to treat, but simply to observe the evolution.

Evolution
After a few weeks both lesions had resolved.
