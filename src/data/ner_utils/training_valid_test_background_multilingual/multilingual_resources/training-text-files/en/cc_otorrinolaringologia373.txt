A 27-year-old patient with no past history of interest came to the emergency department with fever and headache of 8 days' evolution. Initially the fever subsided with paracetamol but in the last two days it reached 40oC and she began to feel drowsy and disorientated, when she decided to consult. Cranial CT and MRI were requested, which confirmed an occupation of all the paranasal sinuses on the left side. The frontal sinus showed dehiscence of its posterior wall, as well as a collection compatible with left frontal subdural empyema. The maxillary sinus was in contact with root remnants from teeth 26 and 27, which were identified as the possible origin of the infectious process.

The empyema was drained by means of a left frontal craniotomy by neurosurgery, CENS with opening and washing of the paranasal sinuses, and culture of surgical samples. In a second stage, root debris exodontia was also performed by maxillofacial surgery.

The patient was hospitalised for 10 days on intravenous antibiotic treatment, initially with Meropenem + Linezolid, and after the result of multisensitive Parvimona Micra cultures, he was switched to Metronidazole. He was discharged without sequelae.
