A 41-year-old man from Spain, currently working in advertising. He has no known allergies or pathological history of interest and does not take any medication. History of previous trips to Thailand, Morocco and Mexico. Vaccinated against tetanus-diphtheria, typhoid fever, hepatitis A and B. He came for consultation in May, as in June he will be going on a 30-day tourist trip to Vietnam, with accommodation in guesthouses and hostels. He will be accompanied by two friends and will cycle along the coast of the country. The tour includes arrival in Hanoi, a boat trip across Halong Bay and return to Hanoi from where he will cycle through different areas starting in Hu√© and continuing through Da Nang, Qui Nho, Nha Trang until arriving in HoChi Minh, to visit the Cuchi tunnels and from this city he will return to Spain.

Bearing in mind that this traveller will be travelling by bicycle and that dogs living in the street are particularly attracted to moving vehicles, his case poses a real risk; therefore, the rabies vaccine would be the other vaccine we would advise in this case.
