Anamnesis
A 65-year-old man was admitted to the Neurology Department for the study of dysaesthesia in the arms and legs. Personal history: arterial hypertension, ex-smoker for a year, with an accumulated rate of 100 pack-years, ischaemic heart disease of the acute myocardial infarction type with lateral location grade I of the Killip classification a year ago, with revascularisation by implanting a drug-eluting stent in the D1 segment of the diagonal artery and mild anaemia with an iron deficiency profile. He is retired, worked in construction, has a good baseline situation and is independent for basic activities of daily living. His usual medication is acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 h, clopidogrel 75 mg/24 h, enalapril 2.5 mg/12 h, atorvastatin 20 mg/24 h, atenolol 50 mg/12 h, omeprazole 20 mg/24 h, nitroglycerin in transdermal patches for 12 hours a day and zolpidem 10 mg before a night's rest. For the last 7 months, the patient reports a burning sensation of dysaesthesia in the feet (predominantly in the inner edge of the plantar areas, first toe and first interdigital space), as well as in the wrists and forearms, which is constant, with fluctuations in intensity throughout the day, and which worsens during the night. In association with this, she reports burning pain in the left hemithorax, radiating to the left shoulder, fluctuating throughout the day, with no associated vegetative cortex, and not reminiscent of previous pain associated with ischaemic heart disease. The clinical onset was acute (not abrupt), with no significant clinical progression. He denies any temporal relationship with changes in medication, intake of toxic substances, infectious processes or any other event. Twenty days prior to admission to hospital, treatment with pregabalin, tramadol and amitriptyline was introduced on an ascending schedule, with no apparent initial response. The patient has been in a state of mood disturbance for the last 6 months, with marked irritability.

Physical examination
Temperature 36 oC. Blood pressure 147/92 mmHg. Heart rate 94 bpm. Oxygen saturation 96% basal. Slight cutaneous-mucosal pallor. No other significant findings. Neurological examination: there was a touch-algesic hypoaesthesia in both feet up to the inframalleolar level, predominantly at the level of the internal plantar border, with decreased proprioceptive and vibratory sensitivity in the left foot. Muscle stretch reflexes are preserved in the lower limbs (++/++++) and slightly hypoactive in the upper limbs (+/++++), symmetrical. The rest of the neurological examination (cortical functions, cranial nerves, motor system, rest of the sensory examination, cerebellar examination, gait, meningeal signs) is unaltered.

Complementary tests
- General biochemistry: no alterations, including creatinine 0.69 mg/dl, calcium 9.1 mg/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) < 0.3 mg/dl. Blood count: haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume 90.7 fl, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 28.7 pg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 80 mm/h, rest unchanged. Iron profile: ferritin 12 ng/ml, iron 82 μg/dl, transferrin 340 mg/dl, total iron binding capacity 479 μg/dl, transferrin saturation 17.1%. Vitamin B 12 and folic acid levels, as well as coagulation, urine systematics and autoimmunity study without alterations.
- Electrophoretic study: presence of a monoclonal band in the beta fraction (11%) and another monoclonal band in the gamma fraction (2%).
- Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels: elevated IgA levels (1,400 mg/dl; normal parameters between 70 and 400 mg/dl). IgG and IgM levels within normal limits.
- Serum immunofixation. IgA: 2 monoclonal bands of different intensity; kappa: 2 monoclonal bands of different intensity. IgM, IgG and lambda: normal.
- Urine immunofixation: no alterations.
- Bone marrow cytology: bone marrow aspirate infiltrated by 13% atypical plasma cells.
- Bone marrow biopsy: the structure is recognisable, but is distorted by an infiltrate of plasma cells with mild atypia, arranged in nests, also perivascular and extending into the adjacent interstitium. Immunohistochemistry shows kappa/lambda ratio > 20:1. Conclusion: bone marrow with an image suggestive of multiple myeloma infiltration.
- Cellular immunophenotype: plasma cell population 3% with immunophenotype and abnormal ratio between normal and pathological plasma cells.
- Electromyography (EMG): mild axonal polyneuropathy in the lower limbs.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 90 bpm; image compatible with old anteroseptal infarction. - Serology: Borrelia IgG negative. HBV,Ag-HBs negative; IgG anti-HBc positive 4.09; anti-HBe negative; anti-HBs positive 77.1. HCV: negative antibodies. HIV (1,2): antibody and antigen negative. Rose Bengal negative. Treponema, IgG negative.
- Tumour markers: slight elevation of beta-2-microglobulin (2.8 mg/l; normal parameters between 0.8 and 2.2 mg/l). The rest (alpha-fetoprotein, prostate-specific antigen, gastrin, CEA, CA 15.3, CA 125, CA 19.9, CA 72.4, Cyfra 21.1, neurospecific enolase, calcitonin) were unaltered.
- Chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral): no significant alterations.
- Thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT): some small left axillary, mediastinal, supra-aortic, pre-tracheal, pre-carinal and para-aortic lymph nodes of normal morphology were observed. No relevant alterations.
- Radiological bone series: no lytic lesions or any other relevant alteration.

Diagnosis
- Quiescent multiple myeloma.
- Axonal polyneuropathy in the lower limbs related to multiple myeloma.

Treatment and course
For symptomatic treatment of the paraesthesias, treatment was adjusted with pregabalin 150 mg/12 h, amitriptyline 25 mg/24 h and ibuprofen 600 mg on demand up to a maximum of every 8 hours, with significant improvement. Regarding the multiple myeloma, it was decided, in consensus with the hospital's haematology department, not to initiate etiological treatment and to observe the evolution, in addition to requesting a biopsy of abdominal fat to rule out myeloma-associated amyloidosis, the results of which are pending.
