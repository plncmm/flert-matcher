49-year-old Afro-Caribbean man, security guard, non-smoker, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On 29 March he was admitted with cough, fever and dyspnoea of 5 days' evolution. His chest X-ray showed left patchy consolidations, so treatment was started with IV antibiotics and unfractionated heparin due to elevated D-dimer; PPC therapy was also started because of hypoxaemia. However, the patient continued to deteriorate and was intubated. He was transferred to our ICU due to lack of beds on 31 March, where he was given HVVC for worsening acute kidney injury. Respiratory problems improved and he was extubated on 6 April and oxygen therapy was withdrawn, although he still needed intermittent renal support. A renal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities, and a CTA showed a segmental pulmonary embolus, bilateral alveolar infiltrates, ground-glass opacities and small areas of consolidation. An echocardiogram on 21 April revealed good biventricular activity with no structural abnormalities or valvular heart disease. Despite routine physiotherapy, the patient showed persistent bilateral lower extremity weakness. An evaluation of the lower extremities showed bilateral strength reduction (left > right) with difficulty in locomotion and coordination, although reflexes and sensation as well as peripheral pulse were intact. On neurological examination, no upper extremity abnormalities were identified. An MRI showed a bilateral anomalous signal in the deep white matter, which could indicate subcortical marginal zone infarcts. On 27 April the patient was transferred to a neurorehabilitation unit.
