This is an 8-year-old male schoolboy, originally from and resident of Mexico City, Mexico, who presents with a dermatosis located on the right thoracic limb affecting the hand and the centre of the palm, unilateral, asymmetrical, consisting of a circular hyperchromic plaque, with fine and oily scales on its surface, with irregular limits of 3 cm dm, dark grey in colour, with a chronic and asymptomatic evolution. On interrogation, he reported having started his condition 6 months ago, after a trip to the port of Acapulco, Guerrero, with a dark spot that has been growing. The rest of the skin and adnexa are free of pathological findings. She denies other important antecedents. With the clinical diagnosis of tinea nigra palmaris, she was sent to the Mycology Service where direct examination of the scales with 10% KOH (potassium hydroxide) showed thick, septate, branched, olivaceous hyphae, some with hyaline endings; and the Sabouraud culture showed black colonies with a waxy appearance. Direct mycological examination showed septate, branched, olivaceous hyphae, some with hyaline endings.

The final diagnosis was tinea nigra palmaris, and treatment was started with 20% urea and isoconazole cream once daily. The dermatosis resolved within two weeks.

The clinical diagnosis of tinea nigra palmaris in our patient was suspected due to the typical arrangement of a black spot on the palm and the recent trip to the Pacific coast of our country, as this dematiaceous fungus is common to develop in these areas. The causal agent is Cladosporium werneckii.
