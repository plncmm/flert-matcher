The patient was 72 years old, smoker of 2 packs a day for 30 years, with a doubtful allergy to diclofenac, with a history of gastric ulcer, ischaemic heart disease with an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension and CPAP treatment for sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. He also had Spiriva, Formodual, allopurinol and amlodipine as his usual medication. She came to the emergency department for two episodes of haemoptotic expectoration, without fever, chest pain or other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination showed no abnormalities, except for slight crackles in both bases on pulmonary auscultation. The emergency laboratory tests showed no abnormalities, and the chest X-ray showed an image with increased left periaortic density with deflected edges, and blood cultures isolated a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, so the patient was admitted to internal medicine to complete the study. Once admitted, thoracic-abdominal angioTAC is requested in which it is observed in the distal segment of the aortic arch the existence of a contained aortic rupture, with peripheral enhancement and area of parenchymal infiltration in the lung, suggesting the existence of a mycotic aneurysm with contained aortic rupture, With the diagnosis of infectious aneurysm in left aortic arch, treatment is started with gentamicin and cloxacillin, echocardiogram is performed, where no images suggestive of vegetations are shown, with mild tricuspid insufficiency, mild mitral, PSAP within normal, preserved systolic function, normal LVEF. Surgical intervention was decided in which the left subclavian artery was ligated, which was subsequently anastomosed with the left carotid artery, and subsequently a distal endoprosthesis was placed via the femoral artery, with optimal results. During the rest of the hospital stay, the patient was afebrile, without haemoptotic expectoration, the urine culture showed the usual flora, and the BAAR was negative. Subsequently, a control thoracic CT scan was performed, in which patency of the remnant of the primitive subclavian artery was observed, no defects of the endoprosthesis were evident, and the patient was stable and asymptomatic at the present time.
