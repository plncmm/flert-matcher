A 15-year-old male with lobar pneumonia of one month's evolution and intermittent fever despite ampicillin. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with negative cultures and negative Quantiferon. He was switched to cefotaxime plus clindamycin, persisting febrile and with radiological worsening. LBA was repeated: PCR positive for Aspergillus, with negative culture and galactamannan. Good response to voriconazole. Given pulmonary aspergillosis in a previously healthy patient, it is imperative to study chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which was confirmed in the functional study (oxidation test) and genetically (NCF1 gene mutation in homozygosis).

Three-year-old male, afebrile and admitted for white appendicitis (histology of reactive peri-appendicular lymphadenopathy); thoraco-abdominal CT scan, performed following mesenteric adenomegaly, showed a pulmonary infiltrate. Quantiferon was negative. After 2 months, a new CT scan showed 2 lung abscesses and mesenteric lymphadenopathy (some with calcification and necrosis), with no clinical or analytical alterations. With suspicion of fungal infection, LBA was performed (negative cultures and PCR) followed by pulmonary segmentectomy (excision of the lung abscesses), and empirical antibacterial and antifungal antibiotherapy with voriconazole was started. The functional and genetic study confirmed CGD (CYBB mutation, X-linked). After 2 weeks of cultures, Tyromices fissilis, a voriconazole-sensitive fungus, was isolated.

Results:
We illustrate the importance of pursuing microbiological diagnosis in pulmonary infection with a torpid course, although this requires invasive techniques infrequently used in paediatrics. The clinical-radiological evolution and microbiological findings pointed to an underlying PID, CGD, which often debuts with rare and difficult to isolate bacterial and fungal infections.
