A 56-year-old patient was admitted to our institution due to an ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery. An angiotomography performed on admission showed lesions indicative of COVID-19; this was confirmed by specific PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The following day, the patient presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. A CT scan showed a free thrombus in the aortic arch, associated with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. There were no signs of aortic atherosclerosis. There was also a lack of enhancement of part of the small bowel. The patient underwent endovascular thromboectomy and laparotomy with resection of two metres of the small bowel.
