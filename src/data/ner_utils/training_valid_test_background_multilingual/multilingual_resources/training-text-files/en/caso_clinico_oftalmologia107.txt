A 46 year-old man came for consultation due to viral conjunctivitis in the right eye (OD) of ten days' evolution that had not improved with treatment with tobramycin and dexamethasone.

His personal history includes condylomas on the penis without urethritis six months ago and current permissive sexual relations.

Ophthalmological examination showed visual acuity in OD of light perception and projection. Biomicroscopy of the anterior pole of the eye showed superior corneal thinning with an imminent risk of ocular perforation, so the patient was treated with corneal coating with multilayer amniotic membrane.

As the results of the conjunctival exudate culture were positive for Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone at a dose of 1g/12 h and topical treatment with ceftriaxone reinforced eye drops (50 mg/ml) for 21 days was started.

One month later, the patient had OD visual acuity of 0.8; biomicroscopy of the anterior pole showed superior corneal fibrosis with good transparency in the central part and a well-formed anterior chamber.
