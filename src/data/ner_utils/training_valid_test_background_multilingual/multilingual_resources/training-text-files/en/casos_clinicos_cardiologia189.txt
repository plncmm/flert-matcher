BACKGROUND:
Family history: father and one brother disease with early coronary artery disease (< 55 years) and hypercholesterolemia. Non-smoker. No arterial hypertension (AHT) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Drinker of two glasses of wine/day and a few drinks at weekends. Probable familial hypercholesterolaemia. In 2004. Total cholesterol 326 mg/dl, triglycerides 102 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 65 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 245 mg/dl. Intolerance to atorvastatin 10 mg: alteration of liver tests in 2009: GOT 366 U/L; GPT 981 U/L; GGT 699 U/L, normalised after discontinuation of statin. Liver ultrasound with no alterations. Fatty liver (slight elevation of GGT and ultrasound 2016).

CURRENT ILLNESS:
February 2018: consultation for having presented with diffuse chest pain the previous day, oppressive, after climbing a steep slope, lasting approximately 5 minutes, which subsided after stopping the effort. In the last 6 months, more sedentary life; previously well-tolerated physical exercise.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Good general condition, blood pressure (BP) 137/80 mmHg, height 171, weight 76, body mass index (BMI) 26, head and neck without alterations. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal. Abdomen and extremities normal. No corneal arcus, xanthomas or xanthelasmas.


COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG: sinus rhythm 80 per min, incomplete right bundle branch block, without repolarisation alterations. Laboratory tests (ED): haemoglobin 15.6 g/dl, leucocytes 7410, platelets 200,000, glucose 108 mg/dl (not basal), creatinine 0.91 mg/d, sodium 144 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, normal transaminases (GOT and GPT), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) 85 U/L, troponin I negative. 
ANALYTICS (fasting): glucose 95 mg/dl, glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.4%, FGE > 90 ml/min, total cholesterol 267 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 54 mg/dl, triglycerides 115 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 190 mg/dl.
ECOCARDIOGRAM: cardiac cavities of normal dimensions. Global and segmental systolic function of the left ventricle without alterations. No valvulopathies, short circuits or pericardial effusion.
ERGOMETRY: Bruce protocol, basal heart rate (HR) 70 bpm, BP 135/70 mmHg. Suspended at 10.30 minutes. HR 178 bpm and BP 175/80 mmHg. Clinical and ECG negative. 12 metabolic equivalents (METs) (image 2).
CORONARY ANGIO-CT: (after administration of atenolol iv, sinus rhythm 62 per min), acceptable quality of the study, with very slight step artifacts. Origin and course of the coronary arteries normal. Left coronary trunk (15 mm) without stenosis or calcifications, anterior descending artery, after the origin of a large first diagonal presents a moderate stenosis (50-75%) concentric, without calcified plaque, in the middle segment of about 10 mm. Circumflex artery hypoplastic, with a slight non-calcified lesion at its origin (< 50%). Intermediate branch of small development. Dominant right coronary artery, without significant stenosis or calcifications, which originates a large posterolateral branch with a slight stenosis, non-calcified (< 50%) at its origin.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Patient with a family history of early coronary heart disease and suspected familial hypercholesterolemia, asymptomatic from the cardiological point of view until the current episode, highly suggestive of exertional angina. Years earlier he had received treatment with statins, initially simvastatin 20, but this was replaced due to ineffectiveness (LDL-C > 180 mg/d) by atorvastatin 10, which had to be discontinued due to liver damage, reversible when treatment was discontinued. This occurred in 2009 (at that time he had dropped to LDL 129 mg/dl). Since then, without lipid-lowering treatment, he has maintained LDL-C levels between 180 and 250 mg/dl. Currently, she consulted for a single chest pain related to greater than usual exertion; an acute event was ruled out and exercise testing was performed, which was negative for 12 METs, but due to the likelihood of coronary disease (typical symptoms, family history and hypercholesterolemia maintained for many years), coronary angio-CT was requested, which showed several non-significant stenoses in the coronary tree. In view of these results, antiplatelet treatment was started (acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg), beta-blockers (bisoprolol 2.5 mg) and ramipril (2.5 mg), in addition to lipid-lowering treatment in this case with a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitor (evolocumab 140 mg/2 weeks) due to a history of probable familial hypercholesterolaemia, intolerance to the initial dose of atorvastatin and ineffectiveness with another less potent statin and the presence of coronary heart disease. The patient is currently awaiting the results of a genetic study.

DIAGNOSIS
Probable familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Intolerance to statins. Exertional angina. Coronary artery disease with non-significant stenosis.
