An 8-year-old boy, diagnosed with food allergy to: fish, nuts, legumes, profilin and PR-10, who suffered anaphylaxis after a dinner of boiled cauliflower and ketchup. He had previously tolerated the foods he had dined on, only presenting oral allergy syndrome to raw tomato.

She initially presented with facial oedema, urticaria, dyspnoea with cough and lip cyanosis. The mother administered hydroxyzine and called the emergency medical service (EMS). Despite having an adrenaline auto-injector at home, and in view of the proximity of the EMS, she was advised not to take any further action.

On arrival of the EMS, after initial stabilisation, she presented sudden loss of consciousness with a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Subsequently, and during transfer to the emergency department, he remained with decreased consciousness (Glasgow 9-10). In the ED, horizontal nystagmus, paresis of the VI pair, dysarthria and visual hallucinations were noted. Serum tryptase at 6-8 hours after anaphylaxis was 13.1 mcg/L, urine toxicity was negative and brain scan was normal. On discharge, neurological recovery was complete.

To complete the study: cofactors were ruled out, prick by prick to ketchup (5 mm), tomato in different forms (between 1 and 5 mm) and boiled cauliflower (6 mm). Basal tryptase 3.7 mcg/L; total IgE 590 IU/ml; specific IgE (k U/L): grapes 0.47, cauliflower 2.46.
