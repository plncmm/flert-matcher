A 12-year-old boy was stung by a hymenoptera and immediately presented with generalised urticaria, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest tightness and dyspnoea. In the emergency department, intramuscular adrenaline, enodovenous dexchlorpheniramine, intravenous urbason and nebulised salbutamol were administered, with good response.

Results:
In paediatric immunoallergology consultation, a study of Apis, Vespula and Polistes venom was performed, highlighting positive prick test to Vespula; positive intradermal reaction to Vespula at a concentration of 1/1000; determination of Vespula-specific IgE 4.43 kU/l; molecular study IgE rVes v1 0.84 kU/l, IgE rVes v5 0.25 kU/l, IgE r Api m1 and IgE r Pol d5 <0.10 kU/l. The patient was diagnosed with a grade III (severe) systemic reaction to common wasp venom and specific immunotherapy was prescribed for 5 years, on a cluster pattern, reaching 100 mcg in 6 weeks. At 2 years the levels of IgG4 to Ves v1 and Ves v5 were undetectable. Immunoblotting was performed, confirming the patient's sensitisation to Vespula venom to both Ves v5 and Ves v1. At 3 and a half years, undetectable levels of IgG4 to Ves v1 and Ves v5 persisted, with little decrease in specific IgE. CAP inhibition is requested.
