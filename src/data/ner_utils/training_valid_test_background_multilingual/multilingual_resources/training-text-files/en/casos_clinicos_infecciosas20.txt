A 59-year-old man with no known drug allergies and no toxic habits with a personal history of dyslipidaemia, COPD with functional grade II/IV (GOLD) and chronic ischaemic heart disease of the stable angina type. He was receiving regular home treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/24 hours, atorvastatin 40 mg/24 hours, diltiazem 120 mg/12 hours and losartan 50 mg/24 hours.
He was admitted to the Cardiology Department on a scheduled basis for cardiac catheterisation. After the catheterisation, and during his stay in the ICU, the procedure was complicated by acute myocardial infarction in the inferior territory, slow atrial fibrillation and severe hypotension, requiring a new catheterisation and haemodynamic support (he did not require mechanical ventilation, although he did require bladder catheterisation and central venous catheterisation). After 72 hours he was transferred to the Cardiology Department due to his good evolution. The following day, the patient began to experience micturition symptoms, suprapubic pain and fever of up to 39oC with intense shivering. On examination, there was no data of interest, except for pain on palpation in the hypogastrium (the bladder catheter had been removed on arrival at the department). He was assessed by his attending cardiologist and, in view of a pathological urine sediment (countless leukocytes in the sediment), antibiotic treatment was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875/125 mg every 8 hours orally. After 48 hours, a urine culture was positive for Morganella morganii resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and sensitive to 3rd generation cephalosporins. At this time the patient persisted with the same symptoms, so treatment was changed to cefotaxime 1 g/8 hours IV.
Blood tests showed Hb 12.2 g/dL, platelets 206000 mm3, leukocytes 12200 mm3 (86% neutrophils), glucose 120 mg/dl, urea 41 mg/dl, creatinine 1.0 mg/dl, Na 138 mEq/l, K 4. 3 mEq/l, Ca 7.9 mg/dl, phosphorus 2 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, GOT 30 U/L, GPT 55 U/L, alkaline F. 127 U/L, GGT 126 U/L, total proteins 5.1 g/dl, albumin 2.2 g/dl and CRP 72.7 mg/L. In a new sediment a moderate leucocyturia persisted. Chest X-ray revealed a small left pleural effusion. An abdominal ultrasound was reported as small left pleural effusion, hepatic steatosis without LOES, kidneys without ultrasound alterations and bladder with thickened walls due to prostatic hypertrophy. Two days later the patient persisted with fever up to 39oC, micturition symptoms and suprapubic pain despite treatment.

Differential diagnosis
Given the persistence of fever after 48-72 hours of targeted antibiotherapy, we considered the following differential diagnoses:
1. Infection by a resistant organism.
2. Local complications:
- Acute focal nephritis: renal inflammatory infiltrate (renal phlegmon).
- Cortical renal abscess (haematogenous) or cortico-medullary (uropathogenic).
- Emphysematous pyelonephritis.
- Papillary necrosis.
- Prostatic abscess/prostatitis.
- Urinary tract obstruction.
3. Others: drug fever, phlebitis, other added infectious processes...

Evolution
Reassessed, it was decided to take new blood cultures, an abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed and antibiotic treatment was changed to meropenem 1 g/8 h IV and gentamicin 240 mg/24 hours IV. A new blood culture isolated Morganella morganii phenotype AmpC (resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefotaxime). An abdominal CT scan showed several prostatic abscesses. Given this finding, and given that the germ is a carrier of AmpC and has expressed resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins due to exposure to them, meropenem was continued, although the dose was increased to 2 gr/8 hours and in extended perfusion, due to the presence of the prostatic abscesses (quinolones were not prescribed as there was also resistance to this group of antibiotics). Urological assessment ruled out surgery at this time, opting for conservative treatment. After completing 2 weeks of treatment with meropenem, the patient was discharged and completed two more weeks of treatment at home with rrtapenem 1 g/24 hours IM and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 800/160 mg orally, progressing without complications in subsequent check-ups.

Final diagnosis
Lower urinary tract infection complicated by prostatic abscesses due to Morganella morganii phenotype AmpC.
