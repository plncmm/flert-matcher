Anamnesis
A 56-year-old woman, with no personal history of interest or known drug allergies, came to the emergency department for evaluation of a pruritic rash of four days' evolution. The patient denied the recent introduction of medication and cosmetics. She had no fever, arthralgias or other systemic symptoms.
The only relevant history was that two days before the onset of the symptoms she had eaten mushrooms in an Asian restaurant.

Physical examination
On examination, the patient had maculo-papular lesions on the trunk and extremities, some with a purpuric tinge, all characteristically distributed in criss-crossed lines giving a "flagellated" appearance.
In addition, large erythematous plaques with irregular borders were observed on the cervical region, neckline and forehead.

Complementary tests
A complete blood test was requested, highlighting a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia.
Histopathology revealed the presence of foci of spongiosis and perivascular lymphocytes in the papillary dermis.

Diagnosis
Flagellar dermatitis due to shiitake mushrooms.

Treatment
Treatment with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines was prescribed.

Evolution
On examination two weeks later, the rash had completely subsided.
