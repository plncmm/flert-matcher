A 12 year old patient was referred for anaphylaxis 6 months earlier while playing sport on an artificial turf pitch. One month later she had the same episode under the same conditions. She also reported itching sometimes after eating raw tomato, tolerating it when cooked. She stopped physical activity for fear of repeating reactions, and no further anaphylaxis occurred.

Additional tests:
Total Ig E 105 KU/L. Ig E peach 14.6, tomato 3.16, peanut 2.99, latex negative. Pneumoallergens: D.Pt 1.46, grasses 8.43, rest negative.
Evolution: refers restriction of raw tomato, as well as oral pruritus with peanut and peach not previously manifested. On the next visit she reported anaphylaxis while riding a bicycle, hours before she had eaten ketchup. She re-historicised that in all the anaphylaxes she had eaten cooked tomato or ketchup sauce for lunch in the dining room, and that the ingestion of these foods had not produced immediate oral symptoms. Given the suspicion of hypersensitivity to LTP, laboratory tests were extended: prup p3 (LTP peach) 41.5 KUA/L, Ara h9 29.9 KUA/L (LTP peanut) 29.9 KUA/L. The patient was diagnosed with LTP syndrome as well as exercise-induced LTP anaphylaxis. A tomato, peanut and peach exclusion diet was recommended, as well as the practice of sport concomitant with the ingestion of foods containing LTP, with favourable evolution to date.
