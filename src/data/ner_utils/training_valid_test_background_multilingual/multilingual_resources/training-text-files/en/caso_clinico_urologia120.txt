Anamnesis
81-year-old woman with a history of hyperuricaemia, hyperthyroidism, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus-II with organic involvement (diabetic retinopathy) and ischaemic heart disease. His medical treatment included antiplatelet aggregation, lipid-lowering, hypolipidemic, hypouricemic and oral antidiabetic drugs.
She came to the emergency department with gait instability after a casual fall a few hours earlier. Within 24 hours of admission to Internal Medicine, he suffered a new fall, beginning with macroscopic haematuria.

Physical examination
On admission he had arrhythmic heart sounds with a frequency of 100 bpm. The abdomen was soft, depressible, painless and without palpation of masses or megaliths. Physical examination 24 hours after admission was unchanged except for macroscopic haematuria.

Complementary tests
On admission:
- Biochemistry: glycaemia 244 mg/dl, creatinine 0.94 mg/dl, urea 54 mg/dl, ck 5,091 IU/l, CRP 3.30 mg/dl. Haemogram: 11,600 leukocytes/l (82 neutrophils, 8 lymphocytes, 10 monocytes). Coagulation: fibrinogen 499 mg/dl. Urine sediment and urine system: red blood cells +++, glycosuria ++, protein +. Mild haematuria (5-10 H x C).
- Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation, 125 bpm.
- Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain without contrast: no bleeding or other images suggestive of acute intracranial pathology.
Twenty-four hours after admission:
- Microbiology: urine culture and two blood cultures in which multisensitive Escherichia coli was isolated.
- Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: kidneys with extrarenal pelvis. Small amount of free fluid. Rectal wall thickening, thickening of the presacral space. Thickened bladder walls with gas inside.

Diagnosis
- Emphysematous cystitis.
- Diabetic decompensation.
- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- Rhabdomyolysis.

Treatment
After confirming the clinical suspicion of emphysematous cystitis, she received conservative medical treatment consisting of urethral catheter with lavage, antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and insulin therapy.

Evolution
The clinical and radiological evolution was satisfactory, with improvement in blood glucose levels, which remained below 150 mg/dl, and almost total disappearance of gas images in the bladder wall in the control CT scan performed 12 days after admission. Despite this, she suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest on the ward witnessed by healthcare staff, who began resuscitation manoeuvres and transferred the patient to the Intensive Care Unit, where she died of cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation in probable relation to an ischaemic event given her personal history of ischaemic heart disease of the infarct type.
