A 12-month-old girl, consanguineous parents, presented with exanthema of 1 month's evolution (macular, multiforme), progressively adding fever, asthenia, hepatosplenomegaly and pericardial effusion, together with elevated acute phase reactants and hypertransaminasemia. Vaccinated with BCG 3 months earlier, coinciding with the onset of fever, she presented with inflammatory signs at the inoculation site. HIV was ruled out and the PID study with susceptibility to intracellular germs (combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous and IFN-gamma defects) was normal. The BCG infection extension study was negative, indicating BCGitis. The rest of the infectious screening tests were negative and the existence of a lymphoproliferative process was ruled out. Given the persistent clinical and laboratory findings of systemic inflammatory involvement, the patient was diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Treatment with corticosteroids (daily oral methylprednisolone and prednisolone boluses) was started, with partial improvement, so azathioprine and later anakinra were added. He developed recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis during the following months. Given the refractory systemic symptoms and infections, a clinical exome was performed with a study of genes associated with PID. A homozygous mutation was identified in the AIRE gene, which causes autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I (APECED).

Results:
The most common form of debut of APECED syndrome is in the form of mucocutaneous candidiasis and hypoparathyroidism at school age. However, as in this patient, cases have been described with early-onset inflammatory and/or autoimmune symptoms as the initial manifestation.
