We present the case of a 29-year-old man from Moldova, diagnosed with HIV two months earlier in his country, on treatment with TDF/3TC/DTG with good adherence and unknown immunovirological status, who was admitted with a fever of 39oC, weight loss and arthromyalgia of four weeks' evolution. On admission, hepatosplenomegaly, normocytic anaemia (Hb 8.3), increased acute phase reactants (CRP 149, ferritin 1296, ESR 102), predominantly cholestatic hypertransaminasemia (GOT 62, GPT 154, GGT 517, FA 931) and poor immunological status (CD4 53/mcl, viremia 53 copies/ml). Mantoux and IGRA were negative. A CT scan confirmed the presence of hepatosplenomegaly and multiple supra- and infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathies measuring 2-3cm, so fibrobronchoscopy, upper gastrointestinal echoendoscopy and bone marrow were performed, and acid-alcohol resistant bacilli (AARB) were found in the FNA of the lymph nodes, as well as acute necrotising lymphadenitis.
Given the isolation of Mycobacterium spp. in culture in less than 72 hours, treatment was started with Rifampicin, Ethambutol, Clarithromycin and Isoniazid to cover disseminated infection by atypical mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis. After confirming the presence of Mycobacterium avium (type I) in respiratory, lymph node, bone marrow and blood samples, Isoniazid was withdrawn. Despite clinical and analytical improvement, Moxifloxacin was added due to persistent fever after four weeks of treatment. After discharge, he evolved favourably, with no growth of mycobacteria in new samples to date.
