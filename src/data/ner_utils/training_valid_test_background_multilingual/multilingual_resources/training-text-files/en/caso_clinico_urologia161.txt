Anamnesis
25-year-old woman, with no drug allergies, ex-smoker for a year, with chronic iron deficiency anaemia of unknown cause diagnosed in 2008, on treatment with oral iron, migraine since the age of 17 and admission in 2010 for infectious mononucleosis.
She consulted the emergency department for fever of up to 40oC for a week and left lumbar pain in the last 48 hours, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea, with no other accompanying symptoms. The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for study and follow-up of the fever.

Physical examination
General condition was fair. Normal colour and normal hydration. Temperature 38 oC, blood pressure 110/60, heart rate 99 bpm. Cardiac auscultation without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur, no crackles. Abdomen soft and depressible, without defence, with preserved peristalsis and positive left renal fist percussion. No neurological focality. No significant adenopathies. No skin lesions.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests showed absolute lymphopenia with activated lymphocytes (already known in the patient) in the blood test on admission and microhaematuria in urine.
- Chest X-ray: no pathological findings.
- Echocardiogram: endocarditis was ruled out.
- Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen: oedematous appearance of the left kidney with the presence of inflammatory changes due to acute pyelonephritis complicated by ischaemia and the appearance of segmental renal infarcts.
- Abdominal ultrasound: infarction in the upper and lower pole of the left kidney.
- Blood and urine cultures: negative.
- Serology: IgM CMV positive, IgG EBV positive, IgM negative, HAV negative, HBV negative, HCV negative, HIV negative, CMV PCR in plasma negative.

Diagnosis
Renal infarction secondary to a clinical picture of complicated acute pyelonephritis. Pending ruling out primary immunodeficiency.

Treatment
Diet with plenty of fluids and antibiotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin.

Evolution
With a diagnosis of neutropenic fever, treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin, intravenously, and a dose of c-GSF was administered with an immediate good clinical response. Following radiological studies and confirmation of the presence of renal infarction secondary to acute complicated pyelonephritis, the Urology Department was notified and indicated follow-up with outpatient CT scanning, given the patient's clinical improvement.
On discharge, the patient was in good general condition, afebrile, with good vital signs and stable clinical and laboratory tests, maintaining her known iron deficiency anaemia.
The patient was assessed 3 months after discharge in the outpatient urology department, with a control CT scan showing heterogeneous left renal perfusion with scarred areas in the upper and lower pole of the left kidney. Laboratory tests showed normal renal function. The patient has not reported any symptoms. Pending further appointment.
