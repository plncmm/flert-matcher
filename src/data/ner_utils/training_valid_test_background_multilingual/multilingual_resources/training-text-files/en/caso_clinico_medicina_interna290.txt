50-year-old appendectomised woman with hypercholesterolemia, with no other history of interest, in close contact with dogs and cats at home. She was admitted in March 2019 with a severe cough without expectoration, febrile fever and mechanical rib pain of 1 week's evolution. Physical examination and chest X-ray were unremarkable; blood tests showed eosinophilia >50% with a total count of 14,000/Î¼L and IgE>5000 kUA/L (0-120). Immunophenotyping and peripheral blood morphology ruled out malignancy. After a course of antibiotics, it was decided to discharge the patient and follow-up visits were made after disappearance of febrile fever and partial improvement of cough, with persistent costal pain which, due to its characteristics, was attributed to the cough.
The study was extended with serologies, all of which were negative except for Toxocara canis IgG positive, and a CT scan was performed with the finding of multiple bilateral millimetric pulmonary opacities, some with a ground-glass halo suggestive of an atypical infectious process, probably parasitic.
Given this picture of eosinophilia, respiratory symptoms, epidemiology, serology and compatible imaging tests, a diagnosis of Toxocara canis infestation was made. Ophthalmology was requested and ruled out ocular toxocariasis and specific treatment was started with albendazole 400mg every 12h for 5 days and 30mg of prednisone for 5 days.
One month after the end of treatment, the residual cough disappeared, in addition to a reduction of eosinophilia values by half and IgE in peripheral blood. With this, deworming of domestic animals was recommended.
Toxocariasis is a rare infection in our environment, caused by the ingestion of eggs of the nematode Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati that usually infects dogs and cats.
