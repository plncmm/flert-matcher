A 56-year-old woman, under follow-up in our severe asthma unit because of severe late onset eosinophilic asthma with bronchiectasis and who did not meet the criteria for mixed asthma and COPD syndrome. His asthma was controlled by high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-2 agonists, montelukast, ipratropium and benralizumab. On 8 March, he attended the emergency department for a 24-hour episode of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, dyspnoea and brownish sputum. Physical examination revealed no wheezing. Additional tests revealed a unilobular opacity in the right lung, a slightly elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase value and a positive PCR result for SARS-CoV-2. She was given levofloxacin 500 mg for 14 days as well as systemic corticosteroids (1 mg/kg) because of brownish sputum and a history of bronchiectasis (according to hospital protocols, no lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was started as the patient was not hypoxaemic at that time). The patient was discharged on the fourth day of admission, taking into account her clinically stable condition, which was maintained without the need for oral corticosteroids. One week later, the patient was asymptomatic. Four family members also had COVID-19.
