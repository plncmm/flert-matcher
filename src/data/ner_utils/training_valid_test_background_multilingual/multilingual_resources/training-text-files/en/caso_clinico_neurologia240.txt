Anamnesis
A 57 year old patient with no drug allergies, ex-smoker for 20 years, whose personal history included: spontaneous pneumothorax in 1992, lumbosciatica at L4-L5 level with some transitory episodes of sensory alteration. A traffic accident a year and a half ago with no sequelae, and varicocele surgery in childhood. She was not taking any treatment on a regular basis.
She came to the emergency department with a clinical picture of five days' evolution of corkiness in the right upper limb that progressively affected the whole upper limb, associated with clumsiness in the left upper limb. She reported not feeling warm water on the right side of the body. An urgent cranial CT scan was performed (normal), and the possibility of admitting him for study was discussed, but he refused due to his family situation, and cranial and cervical MRI scans were requested, although only the cranial MRI was performed. Forty-eight hours later, she returned to the emergency department due to the progression of the clinical picture, with greater alteration of sensitivity and greater weakness in the left upper limb, and was admitted on this occasion.

Physical examination
General examination showed no findings of interest. The neurological examination revealed preserved cortical functions, normal cranial nerves, motor: predominantly distal paresis of the left upper limb (3+ distal, with predominant involvement of the interosseous, 4 in the forearm and 4+ in the proximal musculature) and minimal paresis of the left lower limb, predominantly proximal. Bicipital, styloradialis and left tricipital osteotendinous reflexes exalted with increased reflexogenic area in the left upper limb and normokinetic present in the right upper limb, with osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs present, hyperkinetic and symmetrical. FBPR. Sensitivity: decreased epicritical sensitivity in the right upper limb predominantly at C5, C6 with deficit from C4-C5 dermatome to right D10-D12. Decreased thermal sensitivity in the right upper limb and right thorax up to dermatome D10-D12. Vibration sensitivity abolished in the left upper limb and preserved in the rest of the body. Slightly diminished proprioceptive sensitivity in the left upper limb (observed by bringing the hand to the tip of the nose with the eyes closed, but correctly identifying the position of the fingers). No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Romberg negative. Normal preserved gait and preserved tandem.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: normal liver, lipid and renal profiles, normal ions and thyroid hormones. Coagulation and haemogram: normal. Normal complement study. Immunological study: ANA, ANCA, anti-ENA, anti-DNA, anti-phospholipid, anti-thyroid: negative.
- Serology: hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Brucella, lues and Borrelia negative. Tumour markers negative. Angiotensin converting enzyme 68 μg/l.
- Chest X-ray and cranial CT scan: no significant findings.
- Cranial MRI: some white matter lesions were observed in both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly periventricular, which did not enhance with contrast, hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in FLAIR sequence.
- Cervical MRI: lesion in the left hemimédula with predominance in the white matter with C2-C3 level, little oedema and no bleeding, which enhanced homogeneously with gadolinium, hyperintense in FLAIR and T2. - Visual and auditory evoked potentials: conduction delay in the visual pathways bilaterally. Auditory pathway: normal and symmetrical.
- Central motor conduction (CMC): evidence of corticospinal pathway involvement, especially in the left upper limb and to a lesser extent (within normal limits) in the lower limbs (more so in the left lower limb). Somatosensory pathways were normal from the lower limbs and moderately delayed and of low amplitude from the upper limbs.
- Cerebrospinal fluid: opening pressure 15 cm H2O, 0 cells, glucose 57 (normal between 40-70) and protein 61 (normal if <30), adenosine deaminase negative, microbiological study (VDRL, Borrelia, cryptococcal ag., gram, acid-fast bacilli, fungi and culture) negative. Serum immunoglobulins were normal with IgG index of 0.45 (normal between 0-0.7).

Diagnosis
Cervical myelitis presenting as Brown-Sequard syndrome of probable demyelinating etiology. Sagittal plane in T2 sequence with widening of the cervical cord due to hyperintense lesion in the C2-C3 region.

Treatment and evolution
The patient was re-interviewed in search of other possible episodes of neurological focality, reporting only alteration of sensitivity and strength on one occasion in the right lower limb while driving associated with low back pain that subsided with anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy and did not recur.
A dorsolumbar MRI was then performed, with no evidence of lesions, showing only a herniated disc on the L3-L4 posterolumbar side, partially occluding the foramen conjunctiva. During her admission, the therapeutic approach was initial observation while awaiting complementary tests, the clinical picture progressing slowly with greater intensity of the existing sensory and motor symptoms, without affecting new territories. Once the demyelinating lesion was evidenced, the patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for three days, with partial improvement (some residual sensory deficit in the right upper limb) and the patient was discharged given the good evolution. He is currently awaiting a new cranial MRI for further study of demyelinating disease (see discussion).
