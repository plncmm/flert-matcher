This is a 20-year-old male patient, resident in the urban area of Medellín, student, who consulted for a spot on the right palm, asymptomatic, of two months of evolution, without previous treatment, with a single hyperpigmented macule, dark grey, without desquamation, measuring 2 cm x 1 cm, on physical examination. At dermoscopy, there was no pigment network.

With clinical suspicion of tinea nigra palmaris, the patient was sent to the Microbiology Service of the Clinical Laboratory of the Congregazione Mariana, where the scales were scraped for direct examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH), which showed thick, septate, branched, olivaceous hyphae, some with hyaline endings, indicative of dematiaceous fungi.

Cultures were grown on Sabouraud agar with glucose and chloramphenicol and selective agar for dermatophyte growth, Mycosel agar, supplemented with 5% phenol red solution. Cultures were incubated at 28°C for 30 days. In the second week, the culture on Sabouraud agar showed growth of waxy black colonies without aerial mycelium, while on Mycosel agar, no growth was obtained. A new culture was made to better isolate the colonies, due to mould contamination on the lower part of the initial culture. From the initial culture, a direct examination with lactophenol blue was performed, in which the hyphae described above were observed.

In the case described, the patient presented to the specialist clinic with a dark spot on the right palm, with no other symptoms or apparent predisposing factors. Mycological examination identified H. werneckii as the causative agent of the infection. Tinea nigra is a dermatomycosis that usually affects the stratum corneum palmaris and is caused by Hortaea werneckii (formerly called Phaeoannellomyces werneckii and Exophiala werneckii).
