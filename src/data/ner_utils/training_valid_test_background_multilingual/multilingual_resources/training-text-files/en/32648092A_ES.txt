A 78-year-old man with dyslipidaemia came to our emergency department after 4 days of fever, with no other symptoms. Clinical examination was normal except for a temperature of 37.2 oC. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia and increased fibrinogen, LDH and D-dimer. Chest X-ray showed multilobular interstitial opacities in the right lung. On admission, treatment was started with piperacillin/tazobactam, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone and enoxaparin at a dose of 60 mg per day. 48 hours later, the patient continued with persistent fever and increased oxygen requirements. Chest X-ray showed a rapid progression of opacities and a significant increase in acute reactants such as ferritin and IL-6 was detected, so a single dose of 600 mg tocilizumab was administered according to hospital protocols (severity criteria). On day 5 of admission (9 days since the onset of symptoms), the patient showed a clear improvement in the last 72 h, with a decrease in C-reactive protein and ferritin values. Despite an initial decrease, the D-dimer increased significantly to 3570μg/L. CT angiography showed multiple segmental pulmonary emboli, multilobar pneumonia and three floating thrombi in the aortic arch and descending aorta. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was started at an anticoagulant dose. No coagulopathy or bleeding episodes were diagnosed. The patient worsened due to severe respiratory failure and died on hospital day 18.
