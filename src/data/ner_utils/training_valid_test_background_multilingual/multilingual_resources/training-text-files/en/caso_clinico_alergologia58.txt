We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent who since 2015 has presented with episodes of RLE following stings by unidentified hymenoptera. On one occasion the reaction affected 2 contiguous joints. No associated systemic symptoms. She required emergency department attendance where she received treatment with corticosteroids and oral antihistamines with improvement in 5 days.

Results:
PC in prick test with negative result, PC in Intradermal reaction against Polistes dominulus (0.01 μg/ml) 4 mm, against Apis mellifera and Vespula spp (1 μg/ml) 3 mm, histamine 3 mm. In vitro study: basal tryptase 3.7 μg/L. Total IgE 284.1 KU/L, specific IgE: bee 6.15, Polistes spp 3.16, Vespula spp 3.30 and Polistes dominulus 4.09 KU/L. sIgE by components: Apim1 0.03, Apim2 0.85, Apim4 0, Vesv1 0.16, Vesv5 0.02, Pold1 0.48, Pold5 0.14, Peroxidase CCD 3.76 KUA/L.

Conclusions:
After performing the allergological study, it shows a triple sensitisation in sIgE by Immunocap to bees and vespids.
After the extension of the study by ADVIA technique by components, the diagnosis was made, suggesting an allergy to Apis and Polistes.
The double positivity to Apis and Vespula is probably due to hyaluronidase and/or CCD sensitisation.
Sensitisation to CCD could justify the triple sIgE sensitisation to Apis, Vespula and Polistes.
