17-year-old woman diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (epileptic encephalopathy). Since childhood she had been treated with valproic acid and levetiracetam, later phenytoin was added due to status epilepticus and five weeks after its onset she was admitted with hyperthermia of 39oC, pruritic skin rash and facial oedema. Suspecting AHS, we discontinued phenytoin and started treatment with antihistamines and parenteral steroids. Evolution: generalisation of the symmetrical maculopapular rash that initially affected the trunk and root of the limbs, intense desquamation, especially facial, without mucosal lesions. Cervical lymphadenopathy, no hepatomegaly. One month later, residual skin lesions persisted. Complementary examinations: leukocytosis, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis with atypia. Elevation of: CRP, sedimentation rate, gamma glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase. Serology hepatitis, influenza, mononucleosis, herpes: Influenza B IgM positive. Urine sediment with bacteriuria. Chest X-ray, thyroid function, renal function, proteinogram, immunoglobulins, complement study and haemostasis: no alterations. Phenytoin levels below the therapeutic range.
