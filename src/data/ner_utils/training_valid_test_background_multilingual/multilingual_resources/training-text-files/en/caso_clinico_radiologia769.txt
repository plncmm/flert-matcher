Patient from Morocco, who had started 2 months previously with left costal pain radiating towards the back, pleuritic, fever of 38oC in the evening and cough with scarce mucous expectoration. He had been to the emergency department on 2 occasions, where only anaemia was found and a chest X-ray showed mediastinal enlargement, and he was referred to the DRU. As the back pain increased in intensity and did not subside with common analgesics, she returned to the emergency department.

Initial imaging findings and presumptive diagnosis: ED X-ray: Posterior mediastinal widening and pulmonary involvement with bilateral micronodular pattern. There are two dorsal disc spaces that are not adequately visualised. All this may correspond to spondylodiscitis with paravertebral collections and pulmonary dissemination. Abdominal chest CT scan: lytic lesion in D6 vertebral body also affecting D5-D6 and D7, suggestive of spondylodiscitis accompanied by pulmonary involvement with diffuse micronodulillar pattern. MRI of the spine: spondylodiscitis from D5 to D8 with involvement of the anterior and posterior canal with fracture and crushing of D5 and posterior protrusion of the vertebral body without associated myelopathy. In addition, associated soft tissue involvement compatible with associated paravertebral abscess. Re-reading of the case: When faced with a patient with dorsalgia and fever, we should consider differential diagnoses (TB, Brucellosis, a neoformative process or metastasis). Diagnostic suspicion is confirmed with a positive biopsy of M. Tuberculosis. The micronodular lung pattern resolves after treatment.
