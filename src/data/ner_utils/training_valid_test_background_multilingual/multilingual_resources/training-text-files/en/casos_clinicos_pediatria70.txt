A 3-year-old preschooler consulted for recurrent diffuse abdominal pain, of about 12 weeks' evolution, predominantly postprandial, accompanied from the beginning by abundant diarrhoeal stools, with slight weight loss, without fever or micturition syndrome.

PERSONAL HISTORY
Not relevant, introduction of food according to the corresponding age charts, good hygiene.

FAMILY HISTORY
No family history of inflammatory bowel disease or food intolerances.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
Conscious and BEG oriented. Well hydrated, normal colour. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal.abdomen: soft and depressible, slightly painful on palpation diffusely, no masses or megaliths, peristalsis preserved. Lower limbs: no oedema, pulses present. Neurological: normal.

INITIAL ATTITUDE
Treatment was started with gastrointestinal transit regulators, soft diet and paracetamol, without success for a week, so auxiliary tests were requested, continuing symptomatic treatment. Biochemistry: Glucose 86 mg/dL 74 Urea 21 mg/dL. Creatinine 0.20 mg.Urate 4.2 mg/dL 3 Bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL Alanine aminotransferase: 16 IU/L Aspartate aminotransferase: 32 IU/L Cholesterol: 196 mg/dL Triglycerides: 146 mg/dL Thyrotropin:
0.970 μIU/mL Urine sediment: normal. Stool: stool culture negative, antigenic detection of Rotavirus, Adenovirus and Giardia lamblia negative. Parasitological study (concentration): negative Haematology: Haemoglobin 13.1 g/dL Haematocrit 38.9% Mean corpuscular volume 80.2 fL Mean corpuscular haemoglobin 27.0 pgr/cell Mean corpuscular haemoglobin conc. 33. 7 gr/dL Erythrocyte distribution width 13.4 % Leucocytes 13620 /μL Neutrophils 54.9 %, Lymphocytes 34.5 % ,Monocytes 9.5 % , Eosinophils: 0.9 %, Basophils 0.2 % ,Neutrophils 7.48 x10e9/L Platelets 528 000/L Mean platelet volume 8.0 fL

EVOLUTION
On arrival of results the problem was still present, so studies were performed Stool: Haemoglobin;15ng/mL Calprotectin;242 ug/g stool (100 mg/g stool: positive.) Digestion of immediate principles: normal (no malabsorptive signs) Autoimmunity Anti-transglutaminase IgA 35 U/mL Immunoglobulin A; 180 mg/dL Antiendomysial IgA 100 U/mL.
With the diagnosis of coeliac disease, the patient was referred to paediatric gastroenterology.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
Celiac Disease
