Eleven year old girl consulted the allergy department for pruritic eczema, with a tendency to ulceration, on the forearms, in relation to contact with the school garden. Skin tests for the usual inhalants were negative, and laboratory tests showed a total IgE level of 44.7kU/L (normal). The school contacted the municipal health department, who went to the orchard and verified the presence of insects measuring 1-2 mm in length in the orchard, on the clothes and limbs of several children. The specimens were sent to the Department of Zoology and Physical Anthropology of the UMU, and were identified as Trips, belonging to the genus Aelotrips Haliday (Aeolothripidae, Thysanoptera). The patient was then pricked by prick with the crushed live insects, resulting in a 5mm diameter papule: POSITIVE (10 healthy controls, negative).
