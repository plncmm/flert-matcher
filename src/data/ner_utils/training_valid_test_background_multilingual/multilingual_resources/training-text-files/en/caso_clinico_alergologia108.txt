An 8-year-old boy with atopic dermatitis and multiple food allergy to cow's milk protein, egg, nuts, fish and shellfish. Recent episode of angioedema after eating kiwi. In a pre-surgical evaluation for anaesthesia, latex sensitisation was detected in a recent analysis, postponing surgery. The allergological study was extended with a negative prick test for latex, a blood test with IgE 5007 U/mL, kiwi-specific IgE 5.54 kU/L, latex 1.1 kU/L, rHev b1, b3, b5, b6, b8, b9, b11 negative, and a negative glove test. Latex sensitisation was diagnosed and surgery was performed without complications.
