A 16-year-old woman with a personal history of mixed hyperandrogenism (under follow-up by gynaecology and endocrinology) consulted her primary care centre for fever and odynophagia of two weeks' duration. After finding tonsillar hypertrophy with pustular plaques and painful right laterocervical adenopathy, she was prescribed treatment with fenoxymethylpenicillin (250 mg every 12 hours), which was modified to clindamycin (300 mg every 6 hours) after three days due to persistence of the symptoms. The symptoms did not improve in the following days, and the patient became very prostrate. A urine culture coinciding with some dysuria isolated Escherichia coli. Treatment was replaced with ciprofloxacin and the patient was admitted to hospital. On admission, the patient was in an acceptable general state of health and had a good level of consciousness. She was afebrile (36.7oC) and haemodynamically stable (blood pressure 116/78mmHg and 103 beats per minute).

The complete physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities, except for the presence of small right laterocervical adenopathies in lymph node areas II-III and the existence of hypertrophic grade II palatine tonsils with non-confluent psudomembranous exudate that was detached when scratched. There was no evidence of bulging of the anterior tonsillar pillars or clear asymmetries.

Initial complementary tests showed mild leukocytosis without left shift (11,150 leukocytes/mm3, with 35.3% neutrophils, 57% lymphocytes and 6.4% monocytes). Haemoglobin was 13.3 g/dL and platelets 213,000 per plaq/mm3. Renal function was normal (creatinine 0.81 mg/dL, urea 21.6 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L and potassium 3.81 mmol/L) and minimal elevation of liver enzymes was evident (aspartate transaminase 90 U/L, alanine transaminase 110.4 U/L, gamma glutamyltransferase 77 U/L, total bilirubin 0.34 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 67 U/L, triacylglycerol lipase 53.4 U/L and alpha amylase 40 U/L). Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. After 24 hours of admission the patient started with weakness in the lower limbs. Examination revealed bilateral nystagmus, global paraparesis 3/5, hyperreflexia of upper limbs and slight nuchal rigidity. There was no sensory deficit. Several hours later, the paraparesis of the lower limbs progressed to affect the upper limbs. The patient also reported diplopia and there was a significant decrease in the level of consciousness. An urgent cranial CT scan showed no significant findings and a lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with normal organoleptic properties and normal outflow pressure. CSF biochemistry showed 45 leukocytes/mm3 with 5% polymorphonuclear and 95% mononuclear, glucose 62 mg/dl and total protein 48.3 mg/dl.

Differential diagnosis
In the case of a patient with impaired level of consciousness, a differential diagnosis should be established between several entities:
- Traumatic: ruled out due to the lack of previous traumatic history.
- Toxic-nutritional: vitamin B12 deficiency, niacin deficiency, radiation myelopathy, heavy metal toxicity, drug toxicity, alcoholism, diabetes, amyloidosis, etc. The clinical manifestations of these entities and the lack of exposure or consumption of toxic substances rule them out.
- Paraneoplastic: microcytic carcinoma of the lung and carcinoma of the breast and ovary, as the most frequent neoplasms. The absence of compatible clinical manifestations, the lack of history to support the diagnosis and the normal chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound allow these diagnoses to be reasonably ruled out.
- Ischaemic: occlusion of the anterior spinal artery or a segmental branch of the aorta, bifrontal cerebral infarction, dural fistulas, etc. The patient's age and the gradual progression of the clinical picture militate against these possibilities.
- Compressive: tumours, epidural or subdural haematoma, epidural abscess, syringomyelia, lumbar canal stenosis, vertebral spondylosis, herniated discs, etc. or less intense at the level of the lesion, a circumstance not reported by the patient.
- Inflammatory: we must first consider multiple sclerosis, whose most frequent onset symptom is altered sensation (paraesthesia), which was absent in our patient after a thorough examination. In addition, for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the presence of a febrile process (present in our patient) must be ruled out. Secondly, the presence of acute idiopathic demyelinating demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome) should be considered. This condition is characterised by weakness of the limbs, paraesthesia in the acral regions, generalised hyporeflexia and albumin-cytological dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid, all of which were absent in our patient.
- Infectious: the presence of fever, decreased level of consciousness and tetraparesis is suggestive of acute post-infectious disseminated disseminated encephalomyelitis. This is an abnormal immune response to infection or vaccination that appears 5 to 20 days after the acute episode. The aetiological agents involved are measles, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), rubella, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HIV, influenza, hepatitis A and C, and less frequently bacteria (cases associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and rarely with other bacteria have been described). This would be the first option to consider in our patient. The history of odynophagia with hypertrophic palatine tonsils with inconclusive pseudomembranous exudate and laterocervical adenopathies suggest EBV as the most likely aetiological agent.
Cervical MRI in T2 sequence: inflammatory signs at the level of the cervical medulla.


Evolution
Given the clinical progression, a cervico-dorso-lumbosacral MRI was performed, showing a faint area of hypersignal in T2 sequence, with a linear arrangement in a craniocaudal direction at the level of the ventral and medial lower cervical spinal cord (extending along the segment corresponding to the C5-C6 vertebral bodies). There was also minimal spinal cord swelling at this level which did not show contrast enhancement. The findings were indicative of inflammatory involvement compatible with acute myelitis. The data obtained from the radiological tests associated with the history of fever and the deterioration of the level of consciousness allowed the diagnosis of acute post-infectious disseminated disseminated encephalomyelitis to be established. 
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treatment with acyclovir 10 mg/kg/8 hours and three boluses of methylprednisolone (1g/day, three days) was prescribed. Ciprofloxacin (400 mg iv every 12 hours) was maintained. EBV serology was positive (IgG: 53.40 U/mL, IgM: positive), as was cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology (IgG: 48.69 U/mL, IgM: weak positive). Serology for HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, parvovirus B19, hepatitis A and B virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia conorii and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. In the absence of heterophile antibody positivity, it was decided to switch from acyclovir to ganciclovir (275 mg every 12 hours) in the intensive care unit. The patient improved rapidly and was transferred to the ward, where ganciclovir treatment was maintained for two weeks. No oral glucocorticoid regimen or other therapeutic measures such as immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis were used due to the good clinical course. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for HSV, VZV and enterovirus was negative. A second serology was performed two weeks after the first serology. The presence of EBV IgM was confirmed (IgG: 25.7 U/mL, IgM: positive), this time CMV IgM was negative (IgG: 38.14 U/mL, IgM: negative). On discharge, the patient ambulated independently without external aids, without gait ataxia and without dysmetria.

Final diagnosis
Acute post-infectious disseminated encephalomyelitis due to Epstein-Barr virus.
