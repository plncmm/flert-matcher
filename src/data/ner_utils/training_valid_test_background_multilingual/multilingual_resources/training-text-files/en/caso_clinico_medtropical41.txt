Five-month-old infant, hospitalised, from a slum in Las Filas de Mariche (south-eastern branch of the mountain range surrounding the city), with fever, tachycardia and convulsions. Trypomastigotes were found in peripheral blood and serology for T. cruzi was positive. At the time of diagnosis, the girl died with myocarditis and meningoencephalitis. Screening of 6 relatives was negative for ChE. The home is in a low-class neighbourhood with mostly unwainscoted houses and abundant rodents and dogs in the peridomicile. It is presumed that transmission in these two infants was vector-borne, as no other infants were found with simultaneous infection or symptomatology that would suggest a different transmission mechanism.
