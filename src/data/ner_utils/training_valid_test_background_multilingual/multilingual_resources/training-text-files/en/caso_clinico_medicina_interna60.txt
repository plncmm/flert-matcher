Anamnesis
A 61-year-old male smoker of 1 pack/day (he has smoked up to 3 packs/day) for more than 40 years and an occasional drinker, with a history of: dyslipidaemia, glaucoma for the last two years being followed up by Ophthalmology, and cervical and lumbar hernias treated conservatively, with discharge by Neurosurgery. He was admitted urgently to prioritise studies from the Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic after being diagnosed with a probable Masquerade Syndrome in Ophthalmology, having to rule out as a first option that this was a neoplastic manifestation of a primary tumour. In June 2013, the patient lost part of the vision in his right eye, without being assessed until January 2014, at which time he was referred to the retina specialist, who diagnosed him with probable Masked Syndrome in February of the current year with VA of the OD of 0.7 out of 1. During this entire period of time, his vision has not changed with respect to the loss during the month of June. It is noteworthy that the patient is totally asymptomatic from any point of view. No asthenia, hyporexia or weight loss in recent months. No B symptoms. He does not report travelling abroad, new drug intake, contact with animals or risky sexual relations.

Physical examination
Good general condition. Vigilant, oriented and cooperative. Eupneic at rest. Tolerates decubitus. Brown skin colour. Normohydrated and normoperfused. BP 120/70. HR 60 bpm. Basal O2 sat 98%. Afebrile. Weight 73.4 kg. Height 1.83 m (BMI 25.86). CYC and oropharynx without findings. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: normal. Abdomen: no findings. Lower extremities: no findings. Neurological examination: no focality or other pathological findings. In conclusion: examination within the normal range.

Complementary tests
The study began with the following tests:
- Blood count: normal. Normal ESR. CRP 7.8 mg/l (normal between 0-5).
- Blood smear: no significant morphological alterations.
- Coagulation: within normal limits.
- Biochemistry: creatinine 1.62 mg/dl (normal between 0.6-1.4); filtration 46 ml/min (normal sup 60); rest of hepatorenal profile within normality. Cortisol normal. Normal PSA. ACE 60 IU/l (0-50 normal).
- Immunoglobulins: Ig A 78.4 mg/dl (normal between 90-410) and Ig M 717 mg/dl (normal between 55-350). Ig G normal. Proteinogram: normal.
- Serology: RPR negative. Toxoplasma gondii Ig G 32.8 IU/ml (positive sup 9.9) and IgM negative. HIV, B and C viruses negative. EBV Ig G 232 U/ml (positive sup 20) and Ig M negative. CMV IgG positive 47.8 U/ml (positive sup 14) and Ig M negative.
- Autoimmunity: ANA, antiDNA, antiSm, antiRo and antiLa negative. Rheumatoid factor: normal.
- 24-hour urine: creatinine clearance 54.75 ml/min. Calcium 29.90 mg/24h. Calcium/creatinine 24.47 mgCa/gCre (both low). Urine culture and urine fungal culture: negative.
- Chest X-ray: emphysematous chest. Cardiothoracic index normal. Normal hilae. Free costophrenic sinuses. No obvious pathological parenchymal parenchymal images.
- Mantoux: negative.
- Abdominal CT scan: mass-conglomerate of adenomegaly in the subcarinal region - oesophageal pleuroacic recess, hilar adenomegaly and in the right basal pyramid. Spiculated, solid nodule in the right middle lobe. Largest diameter 21 mm. Bilateral hepatic punctate hypodensities. Possible millimetric cysts. Image compatible with angioma of 10 mm in segment seven. Images of adenomas in both adrenals. Normal right kidney. Left renal hydronephrosis with very thinned cortical cortex produced by intraureteral mass of 6 cm in length.

 Pulmonary neoplasm with mediastinal adenomegaly and/or metastasis of a duct tumour should be ruled out.
- Abdominal ultrasound: Left kidney with high-grade hydronephrosis, with great dilatation of the proximal ureter, calcific hydronephrotic balls and parenchymal atrophy.
No free fluid. Rest of structures within normality.
- Cranial MRI: midline preserved. A multitude of rounded lesions of high intensity T2 and low T1 can be seen. The largest of them has a diameter of 9mm. They are located in both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, right cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem. Many of them show minimal perilesional oedema in the FLAIR sequence. Notable thickening (3.8mm) of the posterior pole of the right eyeball in probable relation to the chorio-retinitis mentioned. Findings suggestive of multiple brain metastases, especially after thoraco-abdominal CT scan.

Diagnosis
Mascarada syndrome (diffuse choroiditis + papillitis) as the first manifestation of a tumour of the left urinary tract with pulmonary and CNS metastases.

Treatment and evolution
After more than 10 days in Internal Medicine, with the hydronephrosis caused by the ureteral lesion visualised by ultrasound and in view of the deterioration of renal function, it was decided to transfer him to Urology. Urology performed ureteroscopy and biopsies. She was discharged a week after being in charge of Urology, with a permeable nephrostomy catheter, with persistence and even slight worsening of renal failure (Cr 1.86 and FG 39), being haemodynamically stable, afebrile and with clear urine. Ten days after discharge, the results of the pathological anatomy were obtained, which reported compatibility of the samples with a tumour of urothelial origin through ureteral lavage. One month later the patient was referred to medical oncology, where palliative chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Gemcitabine was prescribed, given the extent of the disease and its poor prognosis.
