Patient aged 58 years, with a history of chronic otitis media of the left ear of more than 30 years of evolution, poorly controlled. She consulted for left otorrhoea initially treated with topical antibiotics with poor evolution and grade III facial paralysis (HB scale). A CT scan of the nasal concha showed aggressive left mastoiditis with lysis of the cells in contact with the facial outlet, the wall of the adjacent jugular foramen and the posterior wall of the CAE, as well as occupation of the middle ear. ENG showed peripheral involvement of the facial nerve with increased involvement of the mandibular branch, active denervation and reinervative potentials. A culture was taken from the otorrhoea in which S. aureus sensitive to gentamicin was isolated. It was decided to perform a radical mastoidectomy to decompress the facial nerve. Results Cervical dissection with subtotal petrosectomy, closure of the left CAE and Eustachian tube, and intravenous treatment with clindamycin were performed.

The immediate postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged. Grade III facial paralysis persisted after the operation. Two weeks later he was readmitted for a mastoid abscess as a consequence of surgical wound superinfection. A culture was taken and Peptoniphilus harei was isolated. He was treated with IV antibiotics without further complications. The patient continues to be followed up and rehabilitated for facial paralysis.
