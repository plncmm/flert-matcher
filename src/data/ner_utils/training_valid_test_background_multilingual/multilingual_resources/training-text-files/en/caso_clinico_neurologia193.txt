Anamnesis
A 75-year-old man with a history of Paget's disease, gastric ulcer, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to duodenal perforation managed with conservative treatment about 5 months before the current episode and bilateral hypoacusis, who came to the emergency department with binocular diplopia in extreme gaze in both directions of horizontal gaze, greater in distant vision, at first fluctuating, accompanied by a subjective sensation of dizziness. Given that the first examination showed sustained diplopia in lateral gaze (after about 30 seconds of fixation) with no other clinical, analytical or CT scan alterations, ocular myasthenia was suspected, and treatment was started with pyridostigmine with review in Neuromuscular consultations. Over the following 15 days, the patient presented a progressive worsening of diplopia, also associated with dysarthria, gait instability, nystagmus and, finally, disorientation, for which he returned to the Emergency Department and was admitted to the Neurology ward. During the period of worsening, a cranial MRI was performed at a private centre and was reported as normal. The patient had no fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms. Of note, the patient reported vomiting, probably related to contact with an agricultural antifungal drug in the days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Physical examination
Afebrile, blood pressure and heart rate normal. General examination without relevant alterations. Neurological examination. Higher functions: conscious, alert during the examination, although tending to somnolence; attentive, cooperative, bradypsychic, with fluent, coherent, well-articulated language, with good articulation, nominative, calculating, partially disorientated in time, oriented in space, normal, recent remote memory and preserved learning capacity (remembers two out of three, three out of three with semantic clues), abstraction, judgement and reasoning slightly altered, no apraxia. Cranial nerves: II: FO without alterations; normal confrontation campimetry. III-IV-VI: severe restriction for dextroversion and levoversion of conjugate gaze, greater in OI; mild restriction for infraversion of conjugate gaze, greater in OI; moderate restriction for supraversion of gaze, greater in OD. Bilateral nystagmus, with rapid phase towards the direction of gaze. No reports of diplopia. V: sensory and motor without alterations. VII: no facial paresis. Lower cranial nerves preserved. Motor: 5/5 strength by muscle groups in all four limbs. REM: upper limbs present and symmetrical (++/++++); bilateral patellar areflexia; hypoactive Achilles reflexes present (+/++++). CPR: bilateral flexor. Sensibility: thermoalgesic hypoaesthesia in lower limbs, rest normal. Cerebellum: no dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Gait: gait ataxia with increased base of support and impossible tandem. Extrapyramidal: mild postural action tremor.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests: complete blood count, biochemistry, coagulation, thyroid profile, lipid profile, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, PTH, autoimmunity, RF, complement and tumour markers were normal.
- Lumbar puncture: normal outflow pressure and cytobiochemistry.
- Microbiology: negative serology for HIV, syphilis, Borrelia and Brucella. Study of bacteria and mycobacteria in CSF negative.
- ECG: no alterations.
- Cranial CT scan: chronic lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia, with no other significant alterations for the patient's age.
- Cranial MRI: T2 and FLAIR sequences show signal hyperintensity affecting the mesencephalic tectum region and surrounding the periaqueductal grey matter. There is also involvement of the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus, both fornices, as well as the medial region of both thalami, on both sides of the third ventricle and focal areas of uptake surrounding the periaqueductal grey matter, the bilateral thalamus and in the region of the mammillary bodies.

Diagnosis
Clinical impression: a 75-year-old man with a history of gastric ulcer and duodenal perforation who, after a mild intoxication by agricultural antifungals, with vomiting and anorexia, presented with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, nystagmus, hyporeflexia and confusion, rapidly progressive over 20 days. Analytical and microbiological studies of blood and CSF showed no data of interest, while cranial MRI showed a lesion pattern suggestive of thiamine deficiency encephalopathy. Clinical judgement: Wernicke's encephalopathy secondary to malabsorption at the duodenal level, triggered by antifungal intoxication.

Treatment
Treatment was started with thiamine at a dose of 500 mg intravenous every 8 hours for 3 days, 500 mg intravenous daily for the next 4 days and then 300 mg daily orally.

Evolution
Following treatment, the patient showed progressive improvement, with mild inattention, bilateral nystagmus and difficulty in tandem gait at discharge.
