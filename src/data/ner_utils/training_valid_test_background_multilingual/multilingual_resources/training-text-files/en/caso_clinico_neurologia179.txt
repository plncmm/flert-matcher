Anamnesis
Male, 69 years old. Personal history: arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypertensive heart disease and prostate adenoma. No diabetes mellitus or hypercholesterolemia. Non-smoker. Family history: mother with senile dementia. He was being treated with feladipine, digoxin and amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide. He consulted Neurology for a progressive clinical picture of 2 years' evolution consisting of insecurity when walking, with imbalance, especially when turning. She also had a tingling sensation in her legs starting at the knee. She reports pain in the lower back, but not in the legs. She does not describe clumsiness in fine motor movements. No dysphagia or dysphonia. She has not had any falls. Although he lives in a village, he has not been in contact with domestic animals and does not remember bites. Years ago he worked as a truck driver transporting animals.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, with a heart rate of 60 bpm. Normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. Good general condition. Good colour of skin and mucous membranes. No skin lesions. Higher functions preserved. Extrinsic eye movements without limitation. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Normal ocular fundus. No facial asymmetry. Rest of cranial nerves normal. Distal hypopalaesthesia in the right lower extremity. Mild dysaesthesia in the upper and lower extremities. Symmetrical bimalleolar oedema ++/++++ with fovea. Mild claudication of the right upper extremity in the form of Barr√© pronation. No dysmetry in the finger-nose test. Osteotendinous reflexes 2/4 symmetrical, except for abolished Achilles and patellar 1/4. Bilateral Babinski's sign. Gait with increased base of support. Mild instability in tandem gait. Claudication of the left lower limb when walking on tiptoe.

Complementary tests
- A brain MRI scan was performed, which showed a significant bihemispheric leukoaraiosis, mainly affecting the semioval centres and the coronae radiata, as well as the periventricular region in the frontal and occipital horns, suggestive of arteriolosclerotic encephalopathy. Brain MRI: significant bihemispheric leukoaraiosis compatible with small vessel disease (arteriosclerotic encephalopathy).
- The neurophysiological study with EMG and conduction velocities revealed a discrete sensory-motor polyneuropathy of an axonal demyelinating nature and symmetrical distribution in the distal segments of both lower limbs.
- Laboratory tests aimed at an aetiological study of the polyneuropathy were performed, including general biochemistry; glycosylated haemoglobin; haemogram; liver, kidney and thyroid function tests; lipid profile; vitamin B12 and folic acid; and autoimmunity study (rheumatoid factor, immunofixation in serum and urine, anti-DNA, anticardiolipin, anti-Hu, ANA, ENA, ANCA, ECA antibodies), which was normal. Serum serology was also requested for Lyme disease, syphilis, hepatitis C and HIV, all of which were negative except for Lyme serology which was positive (positive IgG + IgM enzyme immunoassay: 1.05).
- A lumbar puncture was performed and a cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry study was requested (glucose 50 mg/dl, protein 47.9 mg/dl, 0 cells), as well as virological and bacteriological culture and syphilis serology, which were negative.
- The study was completed with a thoracic-abdominal CT scan in which only the presence of a nodule of about 5 mm in the left upper lobe stood out, and a follow-up examination was recommended.
- The neurophysiological study was completed with somatosensory evoked potentials which showed an increase in latencies at the expense of the peripheral components.

Diagnosis
Axonal demyelising sensory-motor polyneuropathy in association with Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis). Small vessel ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. Arterial hypertension. Hypertensive heart disease. Atrial fibrillation. 5 mm pulmonary nodule with no change in evolutionary control.

Treatment
Ceftriaxone 2 g intravenous for 14 days and then doxycycline 100 g orally every 12 hours for another 14 days. Due to the patient's cerebral vascular pathology, antiplatelet treatment was also associated with triflusal 300 mg.

Evolution
After treatment, the patient reported an improvement in the sensation of leg corkiness and felt more stable when walking. A study of EMG and conduction velocities 3 months after starting the medication also showed neurophysiological improvement.
