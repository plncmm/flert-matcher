Personal history
Male patient aged 81 years. Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ex-smoker since 1998, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) type II. In 2010, severe aortic stenosis treated by bioprosthesis, whose postoperative period was complicated by respiratory infection, surgical wound infection and sternal dehiscence, reintervened 15 days after surgery. Moderate heart failure, Barthel index: 50 (moderate). In 2012, the patient had numerous episodes of enterococcal bacteraemia and was admitted to hospital on four occasions. Given the recurrence of the infection, an exhaustive study was carried out in search of possible foci of infection, with particular interest in the prosthetic valve, with only a gallium 67 scan performed in February 2013 showing hypercaptation in the right sternoclavicular joint, leading to a diagnosis of enterococcal sternal osteomyelitis and antibiotic treatment was completed with ampicillin for 4 weeks. Three days after returning home, the patient developed fever, general malaise, dyspnoea, increased cough and secretions and returned to the hospital.

CLINICAL OBSERVATION
On the last admission before the current illness, he was diagnosed with sternal osteomyelitis due to enterococci.  Initially, third generation cephalosporin was administered, which was changed to ampicillin and finally to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. During this admission, up to 4 red blood cell concentrates were administered due to significant anaemisation and also due to extravasation coinciding with the administration of a blood transfusion.

- Physical examination: conscious and oriented, nourished and hydrated, chest pain, general malaise, pallor, sweating, dyspnoea, jugular ingurgitation and malleolar oedema.
- Vital signs: blood pressure 120/60 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, temperature 39°C.
- CBC: 20,700 mil/mm3 leukocytes, 8.5 g/dl haemoglobin, 199,000/mm3 platelets. Glucose 207 mg/dl, urea 109 mg/dl, creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, sodium 135 mEq/l, potassium 4.7 mEq/l, CRP 56 mg/l.
- Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 70 bpm.
- Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly.
- Auscultation: arrhythmic heart with aortic systolic murmur. Bilateral pulmonary rhonchi.
- Blood gases: pO2 167, pCO2 133, pH 7.40, HCO3 20.
- Blood cultures: Enterococcus faecalis was isolated.
- Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: In the posterior annulus of the mitral valve a mass image of 16 x 12 mm is observed. With echogenic borders that was not seen in the previous transesophageal echocardiogram in December 2012.
- Provisional diagnosis: subacute enterococcal mitral endocarditis complicated by anaemia due to chronic disease, acute renal failure due to aminoglycosides, exacerbation of COPD due to nosocomial respiratory infection with Stenotrophomona maltophilia and organic brain syndrome.
- Initial treatment: low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), furosemide, ampicillin, inhalers, oxygen therapy, rest, vital signs monitoring and oxygen saturation.

Evolution
After being diagnosed with mitral endocarditis, the patient was treated for 6 weeks with ampicillin and 2 weeks with gentamicin; in the fourth week of admission, the patient suffered an exacerbation of his COPD due to a respiratory infection by Strenotrophomonas maltophilia, receiving treatment with cotrimoxazole for 2 weeks, achieving clinical and microbiological resolution of the episode. Due to the administration of this whole battery of antibiotics, he suffered acute renal failure due to aminoglycosides, but after discontinuation of treatment in the sixth week of treatment, this resolved. During admission, there was a progressive worsening of the patient's chronic anaemia associated with the subacute infectious disease and the prolonged administration of antibiotics, which led to the administration of three red blood cell concentrates. Between the third and fourth week, the patient's general condition worsened significantly, and the nursing team focused on addressing collaboration problems and diagnosing activity intolerance related to an imbalance between oxygen intake and demand, and on self-care diagnoses. The patient's haematocrit and haemoglobin figures improved significantly after resolution of the infectious process and administration of plasma derivatives. From the fifth week of treatment, the patient gradually recovers, and the diagnoses of anxiety and deficient knowledge can be worked on with him and the number of activities aimed at self-care is progressively increased. During his prolonged illness and numerous hospitalisations, in the last months of his hospital stay, the patient suffers a serious functional deterioration, being unable to ambulate and carry out basic activities of daily living; current Barthel index: 15 (Total).


Medical discharge
Following resolution of the infectious process, he was discharged from hospital on 28 May 2013 and transferred to a medium-stay hospital for the purpose of rehabilitation. A half-stay hospital is a level of care used to complete the rehabilitation of patients with real possibilities of recovery, who require longer stays than those traditionally accepted in the hospital environment. The average stay in this centre is between 25 and 30 days, and the maximum stay should not exceed 3 months. The medical treatment received at discharge consisted of: rehabilitation, heparin, diuretics, inhalers (salbutamol and Seretide® 50/100 mcg), iron and vitamin B9. For several weeks prior to discharge, the patient did not require hypoglycaemic or antihypertensive treatment.
