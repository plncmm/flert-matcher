On 1 January 2020, a 42-year-old man was admitted to Union Hospital (Tongji Medical School, Wuhan, Hubei Province) with hyperthermia (39.6Â°C), cough and fatigue of one week's duration. On auscultation, bilateral breath sounds with moist rales were heard at the bases of both lungs. Laboratory tests showed leukocytopenia (leukocyte count: 2.88 3 109/L) and lymphocytosis (lymphocyte count: 0.90 3 109/L). The leukocyte count showed 56.6% neutrophils, 32.1% lymphocytes and 10.2% monocytes. Several additional analytical tests gave abnormal results, such as C-reactive protein (158.95 mg/L; normal range: 0-10 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (38 mm/h; normal value: 20 mm/h), serum amyloid A protein (607.1 mg/L; normal value: 10 mg/L), aspartate aminotransferase (53 U/L; normal range: 8-40 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (60 U/L; normal range: 5-40 U/L). Real-time fluorescence PCR of the patient's sputum was positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. The patient was treated with antivirals (ganciclovir, oseltamivir) and anti-inflammatory drugs (meropenem, linezolid), with symptomatic treatment, from 1 January 2020 until his discharge on 25 January 2020. The consecutive imaging tests shown in the figure illustrate the patient's improvement after therapy.
