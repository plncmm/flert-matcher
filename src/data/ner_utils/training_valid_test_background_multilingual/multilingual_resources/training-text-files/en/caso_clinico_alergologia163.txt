Girl, 4 years old, referred for dermatitis. No history of allergies. Atopic dermatitis.
At the age of 2 years, she began with episodes of micropapular, vesicular, exudative lesions that evolved with desquamation on the feet. Occasionally she presented with more extensive generalised outbreaks with facial involvement. She underwent treatment prescribed by dermatology with oral or topical corticosteroids with Diprogenta® and Elidel®, with improvement but a recurrence that has been persistent on the dorsum of the feet for some months. No usual respiratory symptoms were reported.

Allergological study:
Tests with foods: egg, peanut, lentil, kiwi, wheat flour: negative.
Tests with aeroallergens: dpt, alternaria, cat dog, phleum, profilin and latex: negative.
Patch tests: GEIDAC standard battery and shoe battery: positive at 96 hours with chromium and cobalt (++) and neomycin sulphate and quaternium (+).

Conclusions:
We present the case of a 4-year-old girl, diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, with persistent symptoms of eczematous dermatitis on the dorsum of the feet.
