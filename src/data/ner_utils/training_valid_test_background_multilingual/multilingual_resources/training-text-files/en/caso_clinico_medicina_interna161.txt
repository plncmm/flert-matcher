An 81-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and atrial fibrillation under treatment and a recent trip to South Africa. He was admitted with a fever of five days' evolution together with multiple vesicular punctate lesions of different morphology on the lower extremities, as well as a right buttocks eschar of black colour surrounded by erythema.

The results of the complementary study showed slight alteration of transaminases together with neutrophilia and elevated CRP, with X-rays without relevant alterations. Blood cultures, malaria test and Giemsa stain were requested and were negative, as well as serology for HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, coxiella burnetti, borrelia burgdorferi and leishmania, with positive serology for Rickettsia. In this patient, given the clinical presentation and the history of a trip to a Rickettsia endemic area with positive serology, it was decided to start treatment with doxycycline, with disappearance of the fever, and he was found to be asymptomatic on discharge.

Firstly, the patient tested positive for Rickettsia conorii by cross-reaction, and later tested positive for Rickettsia africana (when the samples were sent to the reference centre).

African tick-borne fever should be considered in patients with suggestive symptoms and a history of travel to susceptible areas, as it is one of the most frequently imported rickettsial diseases. African tick bite fever caused by Ricketttsia africana is mainly established in rural areas of sub-Saharan countries and Caribbean islands, transmitted by vectors (Amblyomma hebraeum and A. variegatum ticks) with an average incubation period of 7 days. The clinical presentation consists mainly of fever, headache with eschar and regional lymphadenopathy.
