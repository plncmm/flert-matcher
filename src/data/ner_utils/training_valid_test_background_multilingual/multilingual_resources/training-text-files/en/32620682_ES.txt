A 67-year-old man was admitted to the acute hospital from an ENT clinic on 1 March 2020 with stridor. He had hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, treated in 2015 with radiotherapy. An emergency tracheostomy was performed because of progressive airway obstruction. CT scan and biopsy at tracheostomy with panendoscopy confirmed cancer recurrence. His Australian Modified Karnofsky index score was 70% on admission, but dropped to 40% during the procedure. Discharge was delayed to refer him to a more specialised palliative care hospice.
On 8 April 2020 he was febrile (tympanic temperature 38.5°C). The following day he tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Humidified oxygen was applied due to hypoxia (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) 89%).
A stepwise treatment plan for ward care was agreed with the patient and family.
On 16 April 2020, he presented with tachypnoea. A chest X-ray showed typical features of COVID-19, with widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities. A fentanyl patch (25 mcg/h) was administered with anticipatory medication for dyspnoea. Despite humidified oxygen at 15 L/min via tracheostomy mask, the patient desaturated to 79% SpO2 with a respiratory rate of 32 rpm. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. Using the COVID-GRAM application, his probability of critical illness (ICU admission/intubation/death) was calculated at 99.3% at that time.
On 19 April 2020 he was referred to the palliative care team. He received a continuous subcutaneous infusion of midazolam (10 mg), morphine (15 mg) and hyoscine (60 mg) over 24 hours. The clinical impression was that he was terminally ill.
His family was contacted to visit him in hospital. His treatment followed the individualised care plan "Priorities of Care". The goal of care was the patient's well-being.
On 16 April 2020 he was more conscious. However, his breathing remained laboured, so morphine was increased to 35 mg/24 hours. On 29 April 2020, the RT-PCR test was still positive for COVID-19. With gradual clinical improvement, morphine was reduced to 20 mg/24 hours. On 4 May 2020, the continuous subcutaneous infusion was withdrawn. Clinically directed hydration and nutrition was not administered when the patient was considered to be terminally ill. A new blood test was done on 4 May 2020, which revealed hypernatraemia (154 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (estimated glomerular filtration rate dropped from > 90 mL/min to 42 mL/min). Clinically directed nutrition and hydration was restarted.
On 6 May 2020, a final COVID-19 test was negative. His respiratory activity returned to baseline and he was subsequently discharged to a nursing home.
