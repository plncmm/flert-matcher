A 46-year-old female patient came to the emergency department with severe headache and tinnitus. In the past she had presented with symptoms of lesser intensity, for which she had been diagnosed with sinusitis. Based on the guidelines of the American College of Radiology, an urgent cranial CT scan was recommended1 . 1 The CT scan showed an occupied left sphenoid sinus (hydro-aerial level), extensive pneumatization of the sphenoid sinuses and a bony defect in the lateral portion of the roof of the sphenoid sinus. Other findings were an empty sella turcica and prominent arachnoid granulations in the greater wings of the sphenoid. The study was extended with a scheduled cranial MRI, which detected a temporal meningocele crossing the bony defect.

The diagnosis was spontaneous meningocele/CSF fistula with intracranial hypertension syndrome (IHS).
