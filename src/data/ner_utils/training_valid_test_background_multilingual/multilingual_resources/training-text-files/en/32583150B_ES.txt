Two-month-old boy with a history of tracheomalacia requiring tracheostomy. He presented with respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and bilateral pneumothorax. He developed refractory respiratory failure and was given emergency ECMO, with which he remained for 8 days. Despite the clinical picture and high IL-6 values, he tested negative for COVID-19 antibodies. A continuous electroencephalogram (EEGc) determined that the child was in non-convulsive status epilepticus, which was controlled by four drugs. Following the ECMO protocol, daily follow-up cranial ultrasound scans were performed. On day 1 of ECMO, a cranial ultrasound showed multifocal echogenicity suspicious for haemorrhage. A follow-up CT scan revealed bilateral middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery infarcts with haemorrhagic transformation. The patient continued to have poor seizure control, requiring several weeks of intermittent EEG and adjustment of anti-epileptic medication, including continuous administration of phenobarbital and midazolam. MRI revealed evolving haemorrhagic infarcts in the occipitoparietal lobes and in the left temporal and frontal lobes and stable bilateral subdural groups, the aetiology of which was suspected to be cardioembolic. At this time the patient is being progressively weaned off life support.
