A 63-year-old man with arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 2013 he was diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2016 he presented recurrence with hepatic and pancreatic metastases, and chemotherapy treatment was started again with a partial response, which is currently being maintained.
She was admitted in May 2017 with abdominal pain, anaemia, mild leukocytosis and increased acute phase reactants. Renal function and ions normal. No metabolic acidosis. An abdominal CT scan on admission revealed a portomesenteric tumour thrombus, for which reason anticoagulation was maintained, but she had an episode of haematemesis with analytical repercussions and it was therefore decided to discontinue the treatment. Gastroscopy was performed with biopsies and the pathological diagnosis was negative for malignant cells.
Due to the torpid evolution, an abdominal CT scan was repeated with the finding of aerial images of peripheral distribution in the gastric remnant and persistent thrombus. Antibiotic treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole, and the patient remained afebrile with no new episodes of haematemesis. Finally, given the underlying disease, the persistence of intermittent abdominal pain and the lack of response to a new line of chemotherapy, palliative sedation was performed and the patient died.
Emphysematous gastritis is an infection of the gastric wall by gas-producing germs. The current incidence is increasing due to the association with immunodeficiency. The most frequent microorganisms are S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter spp, S. pyogenes, P. aureginosa and Clostridium perfringes. Fungi may also be involved (e.g. mucormycosis), although this is very rare.
