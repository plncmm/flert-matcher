75-year-old Caucasian male, non-smoker, retired IT contracting manager, with a history of ischaemic heart disease and surgical revascularisation in 2011, chronic renal failure, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. On 25 March, he was admitted to a regional hospital with one week of dyspnoea. On admission, he presented respiratory failure and acute renal injury (superimposed on the chronic one) and, within a few hours, he required mechanical ventilation and was administered IV antibiotics for a consolidation in the lower left area. Due to the lack of ICU beds, two days later he was transferred to our hospital (specialised care centre). He recovered well from the respiratory problem and ventilation and oxygen were withdrawn for the next 48 hours, although he was maintained on 36 hours of continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVHV). In addition, with high D-dimer values on admission, he was maintained on i.v. unfractionated heparin; a CTA showed multiple segmental and sub-segmental lacunar images, with extensive ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation/atelectasis. Subsequently, he was switched to a new oral anticoagulant. Over the next 7 days, despite routine physiotherapy, the patient failed to fully recover, with weakness in the lower extremities. Neurological examination of the lower extremities revealed hypertonia and decreased strength bilaterally, although more marked on the left. There was no loss of pulse or other sensory findings in the lower extremities; Babinski's sign was negative, coordination and gait were difficult to assess as the patient needed support to stand. A cranial CT scan showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. Persistent bilateral lower extremity weakness and stiffness prompted a brain MRI, which revealed microangiopathy and infarcts in the parietal and occipital lobes as well as in the midbrain and basal ganglia. The patient was transferred to a neurorehabilitation centre on 27 April for convalescence and treatment.
