An 11 year old boy who after eating dates and a mandarin immediately undertook moderate physical exercise and after 30 minutes had an anaphylactic reaction.

His personal history included a 5-year-old diagnosis of food allergy (anaphylaxis due to nuts) and sensitisation to peaches (PruP3). He followed a nut exclusion diet. Subsequently, he presented a new episode of anaphylaxis due to ingestion of a hidden allergen (nuts). She also reported self-limited episodes of palpebral angioedema after physical exercise unrelated to food. From the age of 9 years onwards, he began to suffer from seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis.
