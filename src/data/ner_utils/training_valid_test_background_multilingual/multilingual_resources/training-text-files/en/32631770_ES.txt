A 21-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left facial and neck swelling. She had presented eight days previously to another ED with fever, cough and dyspnoea and was diagnosed with COVID-19. Despite improvement of his respiratory symptoms, he presented with progressive unilateral swelling of the face and neck, resulting in subjective malocclusion and trismus. On examination, she reported lack of appetite, but denied persistent fevers, toothache or facial weakness. The patient had normal vital signs and moderate swelling of the left cheek, preauricular and submandibular, without erythema, induration or fluctuation. Intraoral examination was normal, with no purulent discharge squeezing from the parotid duct, and normal occlusion. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and imaging findings led to a differential diagnosis including infectious parotitis, sialolithiasis, salivary gland abscess and neoplasia. In the laboratory values, the leucocytopenia of 3,170/uL without lymphocytopenia was remarkable. A craniomaxillofacial CT scan revealed: swelling and asymmetric and diffuse enlargement of the left parotid gland, without obstruction, mass or abscess in the parotid duct, accumulation of inflammatory periparotid fat and free fluid extending into the left submandibular, submental and parapharyngeal spaces and along the sternocleidomastoid and infrahyoid muscles. The ENT team was consulted because of fluid extension into the adjacent anatomical spaces. History, examination and radiological findings appeared most consistent with uncomplicated acute infectious parotitis. His malocclusion sensation was attributed to inflammation around his masticatory muscles. She was prescribed a course of amoxicillin/clavulanate to treat possible concomitant bacterial parotitis and was advised to apply warm compresses, massage the gland, use sialogogues to increase salivary flow and keep hydrated.
