81-year-old male, long-time resident of Yiyang. He has a history of prostate cancer and coronary heart disease. He has been living with his eldest daughter since returning from Wuhan and has not been out since. On 21 February he suffered from convulsive dry cough and anorexia. At first, no treatment was given. On 25 February, her symptoms worsened with fever (38.0°C) and dyspnoea. Tests for influenza A and B were negative. A chest CT scan showed abnormalities, with ground-glass opacities. His symptoms did not improve even after treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g every 48 h), ambroxol, ribavirin (500 mg every 12 h) and oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily). On 27 February, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was positive from both nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. His haemoglobin (83 g/L) and lymphocytes (0.65 * 10^9/L) were below normal values, while D-dimer (5.46 mg/mL), C-reactive protein (134mg/L), ESR (126 mm/h) and IL-6 (7.6 pg/mL) showed above normal values. His arterial blood gases showed a PO2 of 67 mmHg and a FiO2 of 33%. Consequently, he was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit with oxygen, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin as antiviral treatment, linezolid, meropenem and fluconazole as antibiotics, and albumin, gamma globulin, steroids (80 mg/day) and plasma replacement (200 mL*2) to improve his immune system. On 2 and 4 March, nucleic acid tests were repeated and both were negative. On 3 March, IgM and IgG antibody tests were positive. A repeat arterial blood gas on 5 March showed a PO2 of 114 mmHg and a FiO2 of 33%. Lung CT showed that the inflammatory lesions had been absorbed and ground-glass opacities had improved.
