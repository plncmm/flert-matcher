We present the case of a 63-year-old male, with no personal history of interest, who came to the emergency department after receiving multiple hymenoptera (wasp) stings. The patient was in good general condition, with BP 132/88 mmHg, heart rate 99 bpm and pulse oximetry 94%. Multiple papules, vesicles and pustules were seen on the skin in the thoracic region, dorsal region, upper limbs and head, some with signs of superinfection. There was no uvula or pharyngeal oedema. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation was normal, examination of the abdomen was normal, as were the lower limbs. Complementary tests:
electrocardiogram: RS at 100 bpm.
CBC: leukocytes 23.9 mil/mm, neutrophils 9.6%, Hb 16.6 g/dl, Hto 48.3%, platelets 226 mill/mm3. Coagulation: prothrombin activity 100%, TPTA 80.5 sec. Biochemistry: renal and hepatic parameters normal, LDH 529 IU/L, CK 462 IU/L, GOT (AST) 73 IU/L, GPT (ALT) 31 IU/L, CRP 0.4 mg/L, myoglobin 526 ng/mL. Evolution:
The patient remained in the observation room, monitored with control of vitals and diuresis. Treatment was started with: hydrocortisone 90 mg IV, dexchlorpheniramine 1 amp IV, tetanus toxoid 0.5 cc IM, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 g every 8 hours IV and 500 cc SF 0.9% IV every 3 hours. Control analyses were carried out every 6 hours, observing a progressive increase in CK and myoglobin levels, with renal function remaining stable, reaching maximum CK levels of 4,629 IU/L and myoglobin of 1,387 ng/ml 24 hours after the incident, and then decreasing and being discharged. Result: Rhabdomyolysis secondary to multiple stings.
