19 year old male operated on for neuroblastoma. He presented with an afternoon fever of one month's evolution and weight loss. No other accompanying symptoms and normal physical examination.
Laboratory tests showed leucopenia, neutropenia and progressive anaemia, with atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood smear. Mild elevation of transaminases and hypertriglyceridaemia with elevated acute phase reactants and proteinogram with hypergammaglobulinaemia.
To rule out mononucleosis, serology for CMV, EBV, HSV1 and 2, parvovirus B19, hepatitis A, B and C, rubella and toxoplasma was negative. Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, and Brucella, HIV and CLIA were also negative, as well as the blood cultures extracted, mantoux and urine culture performed. Echocardiography within normal limits, without vegetations. Autoimmunity was negative. Suspecting neoplastic aetiology, a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, detecting splenomegaly of 16.7cm, with no significant adenopathies.
The clinical manifestations persisted and the patient suffered progressive deterioration. Our differential diagnosis was between lymphoproliferative syndrome limited to the spleen, haemophagocytic syndrome or parasitosis. We performed an immune balance with a tendency towards CD4/CD8 inversion and PAMO with discrete erythroid dysplasia probably related to folicopenia, reactive plasmacytosis and without cytological data of haemophagocytosis or infiltration by leishmania.
Before performing more invasive tests, we requested a PCR for Leishmania, which was positive, after which treatment with amphotericin B was started, and the fever ceased after 48h and the clinical and analytical parameters normalised.
