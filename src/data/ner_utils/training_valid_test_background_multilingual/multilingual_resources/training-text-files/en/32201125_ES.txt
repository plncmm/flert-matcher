An otherwise healthy 64-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with hyperthermia, fatigue and dry cough with a course of two days. The patient reported that she had recently travelled to Wuhan, the focus of the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, to Shanghai one day before admission. On physical examination, fever and tachypnoea were noted. Thick rales were auscultated during inspiration and expiration. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 4.6 Ã— 109/L with 87.4% neutrophils and 10.0% lymphocytes. Inflammatory marker values were high, with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 67 mm/h and a C-reactive protein of 57.7 mg/L. A chest CT scan showed multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Real-time RT-PCR of a pharyngeal swab from the patient was positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre for further treatment. She showed a satisfactory response to medical treatment and was discharged two weeks after the onset of the disease.
