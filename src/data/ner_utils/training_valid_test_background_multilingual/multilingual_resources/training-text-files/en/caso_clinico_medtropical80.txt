83-year-old woman with left hip prosthesis. Hospitalised on the 27th post-arthroplasty day due to pain in the left hip and dehiscence of the operative wound with serohematic secretion. She was started on antibiotics (meropenem/vancomycin) and three surgical cleanings were performed. In the last cleaning, a dense whitish secretion was observed at the neck and head of the prosthesis. Samples were taken for culture. Five days later Fusarium sp. was isolated and amphotericin B deoxycholate was started for ten days, followed by oral voriconazole for four months with favourable evolution.
