A 73-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and carotid stenosis presented to the emergency department with fever, respiratory distress and altered mental status. Systematic anamnesis revealed dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting and decreased oral intake for two days, but he reported no fever or chills at home. He had had contact with a sick person at home. Vital signs on first consultation were fever 38.3°C, tachycardia with a pulse of 102 bpm, hypoxaemia with a saturation of 85% on a 100% reservoir mask. The patient was intubated in the ED with a diagnosis of hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Because of the altered mental status, a cranial CT scan was performed, which showed loss of differentiation between grey and white matter in the left parietal and occipital lobes, consistent with acute infarction. A thoracic CT scan showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and bilateral peripheral patchy alveolar opacities, characteristic of atypical pneumonia or COVID-19 viral infection. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no abnormal findings. Blood tests showed leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia. Urinalysis showed results within normal limits. C-reactive protein was elevated at 26 mg/dl (0-0.4 mg/dl). D-dimer was not checked during the hospital course. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 detected the presence of the virus. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. A new cranial CT scan showed evolution towards a large acute infarction of the left MCA area with hyperdense appearance of the left MCA vessels, consistent with an acute thrombus. The patient was not considered a suitable candidate for neurosurgical intervention or thrombolysis because of his condition. The patient was treated with aspirin and other symptomatic measures. Telemetry showed no abnormal heart rhythm. Finally, the family decided to take palliative measures and extubate the patient.
