ECG: Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm without repolarisation alterations.

Pneumococcal and Legionella antigens in urine: negative. Sputum culture: gram stain. Mixed flora. Auramine stain: negative. Mantoux test: negative. Bronchoaspirate: auramine stain negative. Sputum cytology: positive for malignancy. Cytological findings compatible with adenocarcinoma. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology: negative for malignancy.
