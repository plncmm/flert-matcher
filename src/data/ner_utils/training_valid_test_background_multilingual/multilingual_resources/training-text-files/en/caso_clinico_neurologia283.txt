Anamnesis
A 33-year-old man from Colombia, a professional commercial pilot with regular flight routes in Central and South America. He had no known drug allergies or vascular risk factors. He had no medical history of interest or usual treatment and had undergone rhinoplasty several years earlier.

He came to the Emergency Department for a clinical picture of 4-5 days of insidious onset consisting of dizziness with spinning of objects that worsened with standing upright, gait instability, nausea and vomiting, accompanied by occipital headache described as pulsating, of greater intensity in the morning and with Valsalva manoeuvres. Bilateral sensation of ear plugging, more intense in the left ear. No previous fever or symptoms suggestive of epileptic seizures were reported.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 127/78 mmHg. Afebrile. Head and neck: no carotid murmurs, no adenopathies. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic, at 75 bpm, preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or visceromegaly. Extremities: no oedema, peripheral pulses present and symmetrical. Alert, conscious and oriented in time, space and person. Language normal in emission and comprehension, no dysarthria. Pupils isochoric, normoreactive. Confrontational campimetry without alterations. Horizontal-rotatory nystagmus, inexhaustible, in left lateral gaze, with rapid phase to the left. Horizontal diplopia, predominantly in left gaze. No ophthalmoparesis. Normal cranial nerves. Normal muscle tone, overall strength and sensitivity preserved. Normal reflexes. Appendicular dysmetria in the left finger-nose manoeuvre and dysdiadochokinesia with the left upper limb. Truncal ataxia with increased base of support, which worsened with the eyes closed, negative Romberg. Unsteady gait without clear lateralisation, difficulty in turning. No tremor. No meningeal signs or nuchal rigidity. Fundus examination in the emergency department: sharp-edged papillae, no haemorrhages or exudates.

Complementary tests
- CBC: blood count with mild leukocytosis without neutrophilia (10,640 leukocytes/mm3), coagulation and basic biochemistry without alterations. Elevated transaminases (glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 45 IU/l, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase 124 IU/l, gamma-glutamyl transferase 124 IU/l) with normal bilirubin (suggesting cytolysis pattern), hypercholesterolemia, subclinical hypothyroidism. Negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, hydatidosis and toxoplasma. Cytomegalovirus IgG positive/IgM negative. Cysticercosis serology negative. C-reactive protein 0.1 mg/dl and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 9 mm/1 hour. Peripheral blood immunophenotype normal. Erythropoietin within normal limits (7.2 mIU/ml).
- Chest X-ray: no significant findings.
- Urgent brain computed tomography: in the left cerebellar hemisphere (intraaxial) a well-defined hypodense lesion measuring 37 x 44 mm with vasogenic oedema and mass effect on the IV ventricle with discrete triventriculomegaly was identified. After contrast administration, a small solid pole measuring 7 x 6 mm was seen with a high uptake.
- Abdominal ultrasound: steatotic liver. Gallbladder, portal, biliary tract and spleen without pathological findings. Pancreas with fatty replacement. Kidneys in the lower limit of normal size, with no other alterations.
- Brain MRI: tumour measuring approximately 48 x 31 x 50 mm, intraaxial, located in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Cranial MRI. Axial section with contrast showing the cystic lesion and the solid mural pole with vasogenic oedema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle. There was a cyst occupying most of the tumour and a small solid mural pole measuring 7 x 9 mm. The cystic area presented hyperintense signal characteristics in long TR sequences, hypointense in T1 sequences, without brightness in the diffusion sequence. After administration of paramagnetic contrast, only a fine linear enhancement was observed in its interior, compatible with the existence of a septum. The solid pole was slightly hypointense on T2 sequences, with intermediate signal on T1 sequences and intense contrast uptake. In contact or adjacent to it, some millimetric vascular structure was identified.
- Cerebral arteriography: hyperenhancing nodule in the periphery of the left cerebellar hemisphere, with main supply from the posteroinferior cerebellar artery.
- Urgent brain CT scan: enlargement of the lesion at the expense of the cystic component which continued to cause collapse of the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus and ascending transtentorial herniation had progressed significantly with respect to previous studies.
- Pathology: cerebellar haemangioblastoma.

Diagnosis
Cerebellar haemangioblastoma.

Treatment and evolution
In the emergency department he was assessed by ENT and neurology, confirming a central vertiginous syndrome. In view of the findings in the urgent CT scan, and considering the radiology image as the first possibility of neurocysticercosis, it was decided to start empirical treatment with albendazole 400 mg/8 h, dexamethasone 4 mg/h and symptomatic treatment. He was admitted to complete the study. Initially, the patient was neurologically stable, reporting only occipital headache and vertiginous symptoms. One week after admission, his level of consciousness began to deteriorate, his headache intensified and he presented with shotgun vomiting. An urgent CT scan was performed, showing enlargement of the lesion and signs of ascending trans-stentorial herniation. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and surveillance, and neurosurgical assessment was requested. Urgent intervention was decided, and a right frontal ventricular drainage was performed to relieve intracranial hypertension and a suboccipital craniotomy, and the cyst was punctured and the nodule resected. A specimen was sent to the pathology department, which made the diagnosis of cerebellar haemangioblastoma. The patient progressed satisfactorily and was discharged without postoperative complications, completing the Von Hippel-Lindau screening study on an outpatient basis.
