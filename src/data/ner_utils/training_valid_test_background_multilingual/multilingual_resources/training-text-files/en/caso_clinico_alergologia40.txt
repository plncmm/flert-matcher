A 3-year-old boy referred to Allergology after admission to hospital for an initially facial rash, with centrifugal progression, with confluent erythematous plaques, some purpuric elements, isolated lesions on the target and involvement of the labial and perianal mucosa. The diagnostic impression after evaluation by dermatology was MS. The symptoms had begun on the seventh day of treatment with amoxicillin, indicated for acute otitis media.

Antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment was administered, with a favourable evolution.
On admission, the haemogram showed a marked elevation of acute phase reactants (procalcitonin: 19 ng/ml [> 0.5 ng/ml] and leukocytosis), so he was treated with cefotaxime, and azithromycin was added after receiving the serological results. Serologies (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma, parvovirus) were positive (IgM) for Mycoplasma, EBV and parvovirus. He was discharged on cefuroxime axetil.

Specific IgE determinations (cefaclor, amoxicillin, penicillin G) were negative.

Patch tests (amoxicillin, ampicillin, bacampicillin, cloxacillin, penicillin V, penicillin G, cephalexin and cefixime) were positive (positive readings at 48 and 96 hours, according to the recommendations of the Contact Dermatitis Research Group) with amoxicillin and ampicillin. Parents declined continuation of the study (prick and intradermal skin tests with late reading).

Results:
We present a case of MS with positive allergological study to aminopenicillins and serological confirmation of active infection. The double etiological confirmation raises the need to evaluate the involvement of drugs in similar cases.
