This is a Spanish patient, a doctor by profession, who consulted for fever after returning from a trip to Ethiopia. Her personal history included smoking 10 cigarettes/day, and two episodes of acute pyelonephritis several years earlier. Prior to this trip, she had been to Nepal on two occasions (2 and 3 years earlier), both of which had been uneventful.

Forty days before the date of the first consultation, he had returned from a scheduled guided tour of Ethiopia with 13 other hikers of various nationalities. They visited mainly rural areas, hiking in the Simiens Mountains in the Gondar area in the north of the country. Risky activities during the trip included consumption of unbottled water and local dairy products, walking barefoot in the terrain, contact with animals (goats, cows and dogs) and bathing in local rivers and pools. The patient attended the International Vaccination consultation one month before the trip. She had undergone malaria chemoprophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil and was already correctly vaccinated against HAV, HBV, tetanus, typhoid fever and yellow fever from previous trips.

A week after returning from this trip, she began with a dry cough, fever up to 39.5oC, chills and generalised arthromyalgia, which she treated with paracetamol, ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 6 days, with temporary disappearance of the symptoms. Subsequently, she again presented with high fever, headache and intense asthenia. In the last few days he also began to experience crampy abdominal pain and pasty stools with no pathological products. Between the two febrile periods he presented pruritic papules on both lower limbs that disappeared spontaneously in a few days.

Physical examination showed a good general condition, with BP 110/60mmHg, normal colour and eupnoea. There were no palpable lymph nodes or skin lesions. Cardiorespiratory auscultation was normal, and the abdomen showed mild generalised hypersensitivity to deep palpation, with no visceromegaly. The rest of the examination was strictly normal.

On the first visit, the following complementary examinations were requested:
- Haemogram: Leukocytes 7,810 (57% neutrophils, 23% lymphocytes, 16% eosinophils -1,250 Eos/mm3); Hb 13.8 mg/dL; Ht 41.9%; MCH 25.3; MCV 77; Platelets 200,000/mm3.
- Biochemistry: ALT 56 IU/L, AST 32 Ul/L, GGT 96 Ul/L, FA 116 IU/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 14.1 mg/dL, Ig E 67 mg/dL.
- Coagulation and urine sediment: normal.
- Blood smear, rapid diagnostic test and PCR for malaria: negative.
- Study of parasites in urine and faeces with concentration techniques: negative.
- Blood cultures: negative.
- Chest and abdominal X-ray: no alterations.
- Abdominal ultrasound: no alterations.

Differential diagnosis
In summary, the patient was a 46-year-old woman, with no relevant previous illnesses, who consulted for a prolonged fever, dry cough, generalised arthromyalgia and abdominal pain one week after returning from a trip to Ethiopia where she had undertaken various risky activities (drinking unbottled water, bathing in local rivers, etc.). She had taken antimalarial prophylaxis and had been correctly vaccinated. In the general laboratory tests, the only notable findings were the presence of peripheral eosinophilia and a slight elevation of liver tests. The differential diagnosis in this patient should be based on fever after returning from a tropical region and eosinophilia.

Initial microbiological studies were negative, as were the imaging tests ordered. The clinical picture of this patient is rather unspecific, although it suggests an infectious aetiology. In this regard, her epidemiological history and eosinophilia suggest a parasitic infection.

Fever is one of the main reasons for consultation after travelling to a tropical area. The origin of fever varies considerably depending on the geographical area. In patients returning from sub-Saharan Africa, as in our case, the most frequent cause and the first entity to be ruled out due to its potential severity is malaria. In our case, the tests performed (blood smears, rapid diagnostic test and malaria PCR) were negative. Table 1 describes the diseases most frequently acquired after travelling to this region according to the mechanism of transmission. However, it should always be borne in mind that travellers may acquire other infections that are globally distributed, such as influenza, infectious mononucleosis, HIV infection, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, rickettsiosis or Q2 fever.

Eosinophilia is defined as the presence of more than 500 eosinophils/mm3 in peripheral blood3 . It may be due to pharmacological causes, hypersensitivity reactions, non-allergic immunological diseases, neoplasias, endocrine-metabolic diseases, parasitic and non-parasitic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, chronic forms of tuberculosis or leprosy, some protozoa such as Isospora belli, and certain mycoses such as aspergillosis4 . In the case of our patient from a tropical region, helminth infection is the most frequent cause and, like imported fever, depends on the risky activities the patient undertakes during travel5. Walking barefoot in the field is a risk factor for the acquisition of strongylodiasis and uncinariasis; contact with fresh water for the acquisition of schistosomiasis; the bite of certain mosquito/fly species for filariasis; eating watercress for fascioliasis, etc.

In helminthiases, eosinophilia is specifically associated with tissue invasion and migration of parasites, with the degree of peripheral eosinophilia being proportional to the extent of tissue invasion. Table 2 describes the main imported parasitic infections that can cause eosinophilia.

Evolution
In addition to the complementary tests described above, serologies for Brucella, rickettsiae, Strongyloides, Schistosoma and Dengue were requested and were negative. On the first visit, and after receiving the initial analytical results showing eosinophilia, compatible clinical manifestations and the epidemiological history of bathing in fresh water in an area endemic for schistosomiasis, a diagnosis of Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) was made. The patient was treated with praziquantel 40 mg/kg for 3 days and simultaneously with prednisone 30 mg/day for 5 days.

The patient contacted fellow travellers. Three of them, English, had similar clinical symptoms (fever, eosinophilia, dry cough and abdominal pain), as did the Romanian guide who was admitted to a hospital in his country. A few days later, our patient was informed that Schistosoma mansoni eggs had been isolated from faeces in the three English patients. A Spanish travelling companion contacted us and, although he was asymptomatic, he was called in for evaluation, with a negative initial study (laboratory tests, serology, parasites in faeces and urine).

The patient evolved favourably with disappearance of fever, pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as analytically, with a decrease in CRP and normalisation of eosinophilia and liver enzymes in subsequent controls during her follow-up. At 4 weeks, a second dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg 3 days) was administered. Parasite controls in faeces and urine at successive visits were negative, and Schistosoma serology repeated on 2 further occasions was also negative. The Spanish travel companion presented a seroconversion of Schistosoma serology at 4 months, receiving treatment with praziquantel at that time.

The patient, like all her companions, had bathed in rivers in the area, which is the mechanism of transmission of schistosomiasis, as the larvae or cercariae move freely through the water and penetrate through healthy skin. The clinical picture was similar to that described in other hikers in whom the parasite egg was isolated in faeces. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with acute schistosomiasis or Katayama syndrome or fever.

Final diagnosis
Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis).
