An 84-year-old male patient, with a history of aortic valve replacement and infiltrating urothelial carcinoma, admitted with the diagnosis of radicular enteritis. He was referred to the Radiodiagnosis Department for acute abdominal pain associated with haemodynamic instability. An abdominopelvic CT scan was performed in the angiovascular, portal and elimination phases. Multiple cuneiform hypodense areas in splenic parenchyma, cortico-subcortical, compatible with infarcts. Moderate amount of dense free fluid of perisplenic location. Central perihilar hyperdense area is identified, which is isodense with the vessels in all phases of the study and early repletion of the splenic vein, findings suggestive of associated vascular malformation. A liquid-contrast level is observed in the gastro-splenic ligament suggestive of active bleeding. The interventional radiologist performed selective arteriography of the splenic artery, where contrast extravasation was seen in the splenic hilum, a lesion of rounded morphology and early repletion of the splenic vein, findings related to active bleeding, pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula.

The diagnosis of atraumatic splenic rupture secondary to splenic infarction was made. It has an incidence of 0.1%-0.5% and is classified according to whether it occurs in a previously healthy or pathological spleen. Criteria according to Crate for atraumatic splenic rupture in a healthy spleen: -Absence of trauma. -Absence of injury to other organs that can be associated with splenic pathology. -Absence of splenic scarring. -Macroscopically and microscopically normal spleen. -Negative serology for recent viral infection. Entities that favour atraumatic splenic rupture: - Infectious affectation (mononucleosis) - Haematological affectation - Congenital alterations (haemangiomas) - Other entities (pancreatitis).
