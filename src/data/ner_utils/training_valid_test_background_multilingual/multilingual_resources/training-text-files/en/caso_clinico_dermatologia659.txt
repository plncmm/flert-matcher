Male patient aged 12 years, with a history of atopic dermatitis under control and regular treatment. He is a sportsman, he does enduro motocross.

The patient reported a three-week history of pruritic lesions located on the face, particularly in the right periocular region. He consulted an outpatient clinic, where an acute dermatitis was diagnosed, and moderate potency topical corticosteroids were prescribed. The patient evolved favourably during the first three days of treatment.

However, a week later he consulted our medical centre due to the reappearance of the lesions, this time more inflammatory and erythematous. He noted the presence of pustules located mainly on the right upper eyelid and ipsilateral ciliary margin.

Considering the use of helmets and goggles (rubbing), it was interpreted as folliculitis secondary to friction. In addition, due to the contact with soil, a direct mycological study and current culture were requested. These tests were negative, so a fungal culture was requested, specifying that the sample be taken from the hair follicles. The result was positive for Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The patient had already started empirical treatment with itraconazole 100 milligrams per day, and was progressing favourably one week post-treatment.

Initially, due to the marked inflammatory nature of the lesions, it was decided to maintain a lower potency topical corticosteroid than previously used and only for a three-day course. Finally, he completed one month of itraconazole, without complications or recurrence. A new fungal culture was performed two months after initiation of treatment and was negative.
