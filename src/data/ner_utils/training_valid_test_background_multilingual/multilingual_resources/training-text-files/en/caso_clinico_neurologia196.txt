Anamnesis
We present the case of a patient, a 59 year old male, who came to the Emergency Department with a speech disorder. The anamnesis reveals the absence of allergies to medicinal substances, medical problems and previous surgery. He did not report taking any pharmacological treatments on a regular basis. He does confirm the existence of toxic habits, being an active smoker of about 40 cigarettes a day, and a drinker of about two glasses of whisky every day (according to his own words). In the section on current illness, he describes a 4-day history of vomiting accompanied by diarrhoea, with a fever of 38.5oC, together with generalised pain in the joints, mainly in the lumbar region. On her own, she began treatment with analgesia and antipyretics, but the fever, general malaise, weakness and pain persisted, with the pain intensifying the day before her visit to the emergency department in the cervical area. She reported episodes of speech difficulties, followed by slow speech, bradypsychia and weakness.

Physical examination
The general examination revealed a persistent febrile state; skull, neck, thorax and abdomen were strictly normal. Normotensive. Normal carotid auscultation. Cardiorespiratory auscultation: showed the presence of rhythmic and pure tones, without murmurs, and a normal pulmonary vesicular murmur. Peripheral pulses were palpated in the extremities.
Neurological examination: the patient was alert, bradypsychic, partially oriented in space and time. Pupils are isochoric and normoreactive with a normal fundus. Mixed dysphasia with motor predominance. Cranial nerves not affected. Pronation of the right upper limb. There are no sensory alterations. Osteotendinous reflexes respected. Bilateral flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex. The patient has no dysmetria and gait is normal.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests: only a slight macrocytosis with a MCV of 102.3 fl. The rest of the blood count, biochemistry, haemostasis and venous blood gases were within normal parameters.
- Lumbar puncture: presence in the cerebrospinal fluid of leukocytes 5/mm3, red blood cells 2/mm3, glucose 59 mg/dl, protein 0.57 g/dl. Viral load of CMV, EBV, HSV1 and HSV2 not detectable. Culture negative.
- Wakefulness electroencephalography: slightly slowed baseline activity, on which hypervolved spike and slow wave (delta) paroxysms appear in the anterior temporal region of the left hemisphere, compatible with lesion-irritative focality.
- Chest X-ray: normal.
- CT scan of the skull without contrast: extra-axial left temporo-occipital linear hyperdense image without associated oedema, mass effect or displacement of the midline.
- Cranial MRI angiography: thrombosis of the left superficial cortical vein, the so-called Trolard's vein, without any additional alteration. Thrombosis of Trolard's vein.

Diagnosis
Thrombosis of the superior anastomotic vein or Trolard's vein. Association of smoking and ethylism as secondary diagnoses.

Treatment
Treatment was started after admission with enoxaparin, and a few days later the patient went to the haematology department to start treatment with acenocoumarol, omeprazole and valproic acid. All this with complete abstinence from tobacco and alcohol.

Evolution
The patient showed improvement, with no incidents until discharge on the sixth day. At the next review at 3 months, the patient presented iatrogenic symptoms due to treatment with valproic acid in the form of weakness and a slightly unsteady gait, for which reason the dose was reduced.
