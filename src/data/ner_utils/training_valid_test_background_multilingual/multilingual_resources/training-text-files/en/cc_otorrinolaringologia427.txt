We present the case of a 10-year-old female patient who came to the emergency department with fever of 48h, vomiting, headache and right orbital swelling with palpebral ptosis and proptosis. CT scan showed right pansinusitis and superolateral intraorbital abscess, so IV antibiotics were administered and Maxillofacial Surgery performed external orbital drainage. S. intermedius and Moraxella osloensis were isolated in the abscess culture. The evolution was not good and the patient continued to present orbital inflammation, fever and vomiting. A new CT scan showed persistent pansinusitis, a new superomedial orbital abscess and frontoparietotemporal subdural empyema. Endoscopic drainage of the paranasal sinuses and medial orbit was performed, and neurosurgery carried out open drainage of the empyema. Despite these interventions, 12 hours later, a medial orbital abscess was seen again on CT scan and the patient underwent another operation by Maxillofacial Surgery. A culture of the subdural empyema isolated Parvimonas micra, an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity. The evolution was slow during 50 days of hospitalisation, during which he presented candidemia, leukopenia and hypocomplementemia. Numerous follow-up MRI scans were performed until complete resolution was observed. Subsequent examinations ruled out persistent immune disorders. Six months later, the patient presented mild eyelid ptosis as a sequela.

Our patient was immunocompetent and healthy, and from a very early stage presented with headache and vomiting. Cultures showed a polymicrobial infection, present in more than half of these patients, and with the usual combination of Gram + such as staphylococci and streptococci together with anaerobic bacteria.
