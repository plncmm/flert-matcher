75-year-old woman with hypertension, chronic renal disease, chronic venous insufficiency, angina, severe persistent bronchial asthma with bronchiectasis chronically colonised by multi-resistant P. aeruginosa with frequent episodes of flare-ups. He was treated with Omeprazole, Buprenorphine, Furosemide, Hemovas, Theophylline, Montelukast, Diltiazem, Ranolazine, inhaled Colistin, Fluticasone/Formoterol and tiotropium bromide. He presented with generalised abdominal pain, predominantly in the right flank, of one day's evolution, fever of 38oC and nausea without vomiting or other associated symptoms. Examination with acceptable general condition, eupneic, normotensive, tachycardic and afebrile. Cardiopulmonary auscultation with bibasal crackles and scattered rhonchi. Abdomen globular, soft and depressible, painful on diffuse palpation and with greater intensity on the right flank. Extremities with signs of venous insufficiency.

Complementary tests
CBC with Hb 13.6g/dl; leukocytosis 21,000/mcl with neutrophilia; normal platelets; hyperfibrinogenemia; creatinine 1mg/dl; urea 68mg/dl; CRP 17.6mg/l. Abdominal X-ray with dilated loops with no evidence of obstruction. Abdominal CT scan with findings suggestive of an infectious/inflammatory process in a segment of the ascending colon/hepatic angle.

Evolution
He received empirical antibiotherapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam, corticotherapy with Dexamethasone, digestive rest and peripheral parenteral parenteral nutrition, presenting clinical, analytical and ultrasound improvement.
Colonoscopy was requested but was not assessable due to the presence of active bleeding and clots with secondary anaemia requiring transfusion of haemoconcentrates. A repeat colonoscopy was performed, with findings compatible with suspected ischaemic colitis in the right colon, and a biopsy of the lesion was performed.
Subsequently, in view of the good clinical evolution, a low-residue diet and nutritional supplements were reintroduced with good tolerance.
Pathological anatomy results were obtained with immunohistochemical confirmation of colitis due to Cytomegalovirus (CMV). It was decided to start oral treatment with oral Valganciclovir 900mg every 12 hours for 14 days, and the patient attended subsequent check-ups completely asymptomatic. Based on the clinical manifestations, a differential diagnosis was made with abdominal infectious, inflammatory, tumour and ischaemic processes. The diagnosis was made by biopsy. Treatment should be supportive and antiviral against CMV.
