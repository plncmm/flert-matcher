78-year-old male with probable mercury allergy, smoker, occasional enolic consumption and history of: HBP, dyslipidaemia (statins), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol since 2003 (CHA2DS2VASc = 3), subclinical hyperthyroidism and doubtful repeated UTIs with persistently negative urine cultures.
Admitted for fever and haematuria of 2 days' evolution, without micturition syndrome or other infectious symptoms. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants and hypertransaminasemia, urine sediment with haematuria without pyuria or proteinuria. It was interpreted as a possible febrile UTI and Ceftriaxone was started, after collecting urine and blood cultures. Renal ultrasound without alterations. New cultures were taken and the patient was switched to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, due to persistent fever. BK and PCR for tuberculosis in urine, negative; abdominal-pelvic CT scan, normal; prostate MRI without abscesses, although with PI-RADS 4 nodule (suspicious of malignancy). Urine cytology without atypia. Given the negative results of the cultures, antibiotic therapy was suspended. On cross-examination, he reported myalgia in both thighs (intensified during febrile peaks) and began during admission with oedema in bilateral LES, predominantly on the right with Doppler ultrasound of the LES, which ruled out DVT but reported significant soft tissue oedema. MRI of the right thigh, suggestive of myositis. She had normal CK, Aldolase was requested and found to be elevated. Immunological study negative (including immunoglobulins, ANA, ENA, Anti-DNA, FR, Anti-CCP, myopathy profile, Anti- HMGCoA-reductase, ANCA, Anti-PR3, Anti-MBG). Other laboratory tests normal (including C3, C4, Cryoglobulins and Proteinogram). Negative serologies (HCV, HBV, HIV, R.conorii, B.burgdoferi, Rose Bengal, Toxoplasma, CMV, T.spiralis, E.histolytica).
A biopsy of the right thigh was performed and Prednisone was started at 1mg/Kg/d, with disappearance of fever and improvement in blood tests. AP: inconclusive. With the decrease in the dose of corticosteroids, a new increase in acute phase reactants, leukocytosis, hypertransaminasemia and elevated Aldolase (normal CK). EMG: normal. New biopsy (left vastus external thigh): compatible with polyarteritis nodosa.
We continued with corticoids in a descending pattern and associated Azathioprine, with good clinical-analytical evolution for the moment. It would be a PAN with only muscular involvement.
