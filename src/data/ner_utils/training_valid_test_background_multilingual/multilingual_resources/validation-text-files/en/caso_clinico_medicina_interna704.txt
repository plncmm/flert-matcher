A 21-year-old woman with no personal history of interest came to the emergency department for continuous and intense abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, not radiating, associated with fever (38.1oC). The pain increased with respiratory movements, and was not relieved after ingestion or bowel movements. Examination revealed pain on deep palpation in the right hypochondrium, without organomegaly or peritonism, as well as the absence of mucocutaneous jaundice.
Basic complementary tests included: CRP 148 mg/L, iron deficiency and folic acid deficiency, GOT 56 IU/L and GGT 40 IU/L, and coagulation alteration with prothrombin activity of 61%. Given the persistence of significant abdominal pain, fever and analytical findings, an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed in addition to abdominal CT scan, which revealed hepatomegaly, a large amount of free perihepatic and pelvic fluid, as well as an increase in the intensity of adjacent mesenteric fat, findings compatible with complicated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). After assessment by gynaecology and general surgery, it was concluded that she did not present acute abdominal pathology requiring urgent surgery, nor did she meet the criteria for PID.
She was admitted to internal medicine to begin the diagnostic process, suggestive a priori of inflammatory bowel disease versus infectious abdominal pathology. All tests performed during admission were negative, including: magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy with staged biopsies, as well as multiple serologies (CMV, HSV, HBV, HCV, HBV, HIV, HAV) and complete microbiological study of stool. Vaginal exudate culture was also negative for Gardenella, Trichomonas and Gonococcus.
We finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel with positive IgG and IgM serology for Chlamydia trachomatis which, together with the clinical and imaging tests, were highly suggestive of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) or C. trachomatis perihepatitis. Treatment was started with Doxycycline 100mg/12h for 14 days with complete resolution of the clinical picture that led to admission.
