A 43-year-old male patient consulted for symmetrical and global weakness of the 4 limbs of progressive intensity with inability to ambulate, as well as alterations in the sensitivity of the 4 limbs at the distal level. Ten days earlier he had presented with a self-limited episode of diarrhoea, followed by symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.
Neurological examination revealed weakness of all 4 limbs with muscle balance 3/5 proximal, 4/5 distal and universal areflexia. The chest X-ray showed changes suggestive of incipient COVID-19 pneumonia. The PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The EMG conduction study showed increased distal motor latencies and decreased sensory conduction velocities in the nerves examined, as well as increased minimum F wave latency for the right L5 and S1 roots, suggestive of demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis and compatible with the clinical suspicion of GBS.
During admission, he was assessed jointly by the pulmonology and neurology departments. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered for 5 days and the treatment indicated according to the protocol for COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine sulphate, antiretrovirals (lopinavir and ritonavir), antibiotics (amoxicillin), corticoids and low-flow oxygen therapy. During the first 2 days of hospitalisation, motor function worsened, with bilateral facial paresis and dysphagia. Subsequently, the clinical evolution was satisfactory both from a neurological and respiratory point of view.
