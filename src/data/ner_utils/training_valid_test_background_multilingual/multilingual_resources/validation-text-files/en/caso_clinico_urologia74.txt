Anamnesis
A 73-year-old man with a history of prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 3 + 3 bilateral) treated with interstitial brachytherapy (45 i 125 seeds with 20.7 mCi activity) one year ago, smoker 3 packs/year, with no other history of interest. He was referred to the outpatient urology department for dysuria, difficulty urinating and pain in the penis. He was subsequently accompanied by macroscopic haematuria.

Physical examination
Penis with phimosis not very closed, distal third with severe induration, without lesions on the skin or glans penis. No palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal regions. Rectal examination, prostate volume I somewhat indurated bilaterally. The rest of the body was unaltered.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests: prostate specific antigen (PSA) 0.6 ng/ml, leukocytes 11,400/l (68% neutrophils), haemoglobin 13 g/dl, the rest without alterations.
- Urethrocystoscopy: no alterations.
- Urinary cytology: negative for malignant cells.
- Circumcision with biopsy of the meatus and glans.
- Pathological anatomy: foreskin with no alterations, meatus with chronic inflammation and atypical squamous cells, glans with infiltration with atypical squamous cells. PCR with HPV genotyping for type 58.
- Core needle biopsy of corpora cavernosa: infiltration by squamous cell carcinoma.
- Computed tomography (CT): mediastinal adenopathies of 16 mm in the prevascular space and 19 mm in the subcarinal space. Right hilar adenopathies of 20 mm. Nodule in the right upper pulmonary lobe.
- PET scan: pathological uptake of hilar, paratracheal and mediastinal adenopathies.
- Cytology of bronchial aspirate: negative for malignant cells.
- Echobronchoscopy-guided biopsy of mediastinal adenopathies: metastasis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. PCR with HPV genotype positive for types 58 and 35.

Diagnosis
Stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.

Treatment
Radical penectomy with perineal urethrostomy.
Pathology: massive penile lymphovascular infiltration by moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Surgical margins free, with neoplastic lymphovascular permiation. pT3 G2 pNx Li V1.

Evolution
The patient was discharged with an uncomplicated postoperative period, currently in the Palliative Care Unit with pain control, pending initiation of palliative chemotherapy. In the last control CT scan, the mediastinal adenopathies have increased in size.
