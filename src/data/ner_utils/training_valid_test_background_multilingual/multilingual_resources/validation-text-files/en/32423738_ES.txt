A 5-month-old boy had been diagnosed with heart failure and type I H mucopolysaccharidosis (Hurler syndrome) when he was 1 month old. At 5 months of age, the patient was hospitalised after a 24-hour presentation of irritability, febrile fever (below 38 C), cough, rhinorrhoea and vomiting. He showed pallor, mild respiratory distress and bibasal pulmonary subcrepitant. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly without consolidations. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 160l.p.m. and biventricular hypertrophy. The last echocardiogram performed 2 weeks before admission showed left ventricular dilatation with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 39mm Z+7.3 EF30% and global longitudinal deformation -10%. The white blood cell count was 21,400/mm3 with 12,890/mm3 neutrophils and C-reactive protein 36mg/L. Treatment was started with water restriction and conventional oxygen therapy (1-2 LPM).
COVID-19 infection was suspected and a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. In the ED, captopril was withdrawn prior to confirmation of the diagnosis. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient was stable without oxygen therapy. After 48 hours, increased bilateral pulmonary crackles and eyelid oedema were observed. He had a low-grade fever with no laboratory findings, which was interpreted as a worsening of heart failure with a good response to diuretic treatment. However, 72 hours after admission, he presented high fever (39.6 C) and respiratory distress; chest X-ray showed extensive symmetrical parahilar consolidations reaching the paracardiac region and the left lung base. Blood tests showed no lymphocytopenia (2540/μL), C-reactive protein value was 244mg/L and D-dimer was 973ng/mL. Blood cultures were negative. Hydroxychloroquine and ceftriaxone were prescribed, and remidavir was requested, but 2 hours later the patient went into cardiac arrest requiring intubation. After admission to the paediatric intensive care unit, he suffered a second fatal cardiac arrest.
