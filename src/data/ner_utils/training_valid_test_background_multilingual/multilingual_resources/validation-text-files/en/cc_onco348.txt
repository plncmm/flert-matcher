Anamnesis
A 51-year-old woman consulted her primary care doctor in April 2015 for self-palpation of a painless nodule in the left breast, which she reported had been present for a year, and was referred to the gynaecology department for examination.
Personal History: No medical or surgical history of interest. Oral contraceptives for 8 years.

Physical examination
On physical examination the patient presented marked breast asymmetry. The right breast is normal in appearance while the left breast shows a hard, fixed lump of approximately 10cm, adherent to deep planes and very close to the skin. No axillary lymph nodes are palpable.

Complementary tests
"Bilateral mammography (14/04/2015): In the left breast, an 8cm mass with poorly defined borders is identified.
"Bilateral breast ultrasound (14/04/2015): Hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass with solid content that imprints on the nipple-areola complex, with apparent infiltration. No adenopathies are identified.
"Breast MRI (03/05/2015): 8 cm mass located in the inner quadrants of the left breast, hypervascular, with marked enhancement and cutaneous involvement. Lesion of 18mm in supero-internal quadrants of contralateral breast of similar appearance. Non-specific bilateral axillary nodes.
"Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT (07/05/2015): No evidence of distant disease.
"Tumour markers (07/05/2015): CEA 1.8, CA 15-3 5.4.

Diagnosis
Right breast: Angiosarcoma (CD34+, CD31+).
Left breast: Angiosarcoma (CD34+, CD31+) HHV8 negative. Absence of k-RAS and NRAS mutation. Ki67 25%.
Bilateral primary angiosarcoma of the breast.

Treatment
Initially (26/05/2015), simple mastectomy of the left breast and quadrantectomy of the right breast, later deciding to perform a right mastectomy due to insufficient margins (23/06/2015). 
AP: Angiosarcoma (CD31 and CD34 expression). Ki67 20-25%. Grade 2. No vascular permeation or perineural infiltration.
The case was presented to the breast tumour committee and it was decided that, given the histology, the patient would be a candidate for adjuvant radiotherapy treatment, which was carried out on the left hemithorax due to the size of the tumour.
It was decided not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy treatment due to the low expected benefit.

Evolution
The patient was followed up. The first CT scan performed for re-evaluation on 20/09/2015 showed the appearance of liver lesions in segment VI and VII and another larger one in segment VI.
At this point it was decided to start first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease with Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, which began on 16 October 2015. After four cycles of treatment, a thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed on 31 January 2016, which showed persistence of the liver lesions described above, but with greater necrotic content inside, which could indicate a partial response to treatment. The patient showed good tolerance to treatment, although with grade 1 neurotoxicity.
After the administration of 7 cycles, a new thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed on 22 April 2016, showing discrete progression of the disease in the liver with two new splenic lesions.
It was decided to complete the molecular study of the tumour in order to perform targeted treatment, and no ALK rearrangement or microsatellite instability was observed, with MET amplification of only 10%. A new line of treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was started in May 2016.
