Anamnesis
A 71-year-old patient attended the Emergency Department in February 2014 with progressive dyspnoea until he became resting, together with a cough without expectoration. He had no other symptoms.

His past history of interest included well-controlled arterial hypertension and subclinical hypothyroidism.
In April 2007, after being diagnosed by chance with a left renal mass in an abdominal ultrasound, a radical left nephrectomy was performed, with an anatomopathological diagnosis of G2-3 Fuhrman clear cell renal carcinoma that respects the capsule, but infiltrates the renal vein (pT3aNx). The patient continued to be followed up until December 2008, after a disease-free interval of 20 months, when a recurrence was observed in the mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes, which was confirmed after an echoendoscopy-guided puncture of an adenopathy, with cytological results compatible with carcinoma of renal origin. As this was a patient with a good prognosis according to MSKCC criteria, treatment was started in January 2009 with sunitinib 50 mg per day according to the 4/2 schedule, receiving a total of 33 cycles, achieving a partial response of the adenopathic disease. Since cycle 13, the patient required a dose reduction of one dose level due to grade III neutropenia. In June 2013, after a progression-free interval of 54 months, she was admitted due to instability, and a single 2.9 cm brain lesion was identified in the occipital region, which was resected with free margins by the neurosurgery team, with histological results compatible with renal origin. A new line of treatment with everolimus 10 mg daily was started in September 2013.
Three months later, the patient required urgent assessment due to partial respiratory failure.
Steroid treatment was started, a high-resolution CT scan was performed with an image compatible with toxic pneumonitis and microbiological cultures were requested, which were negative. Following clinical improvement, everolimus was reintroduced at a dose of 5 mg/24 h, and the patient remained on this treatment until her admission in February 2014 with suspected grade III toxic interstitial pneumonitis. Radiologically, the patient showed stability of the tumour disease, but with persistence of an extensive alveolar interstitial infiltrate.

Physical examination
Examination revealed tachypnoea at 20 rpm and basal oxygen saturation 85% and with nasal goggles at 4 bpm 92%. Pulmonary auscultation revealed basal dry crackles. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

Complementary tests
"Laboratory tests showed anaemia with haemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, no leukocytosis or left shift.
"Chest X-ray: bilateral alveolar interstitial infiltrate.
"Thoracic CT angiography: no signs of acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Mediastinal adenopathies.
Extensive pulmonary involvement, predominantly interstitial, slightly increased with respect to the previous study.
"In view of the CT findings, as well as the patient's torpid clinical evolution, it was decided to perform a fibrobronchoscopy to rule out other associated infectious or inflammatory processes and to confirm everolimus pneumonitis. This was performed, and macroscopically identified chronic inflammatory signs, and the samples obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were sent for microbiology and transbronchial biopsy for pathological anatomy.
"Microbiology. Sputum culture: usual bacterial flora, Nocardia culture: negative, Zhiel-auramine: negative, Aspergillus: negative, C. pneumoniae: negative, PCR CMV and respiratory viruses: negative, pneumococcal and legionella antigenuria: negative, blood and urine cultures: negative.
"Pathology: malignant epithelial cell emboli in capillary vessels under the bronchial mucosa. The cells have large clear cytoplasm and central nucleus with prominent nucleolus. Immunohistochemistry was performed with positive CD10 and negative TTF1, so the result was compatible with carcinomatous lymphangitis of renal origin.

Diagnosis
After ruling out infectious origin, and with histological confirmation that the patient's bilateral pulmonary alveolar infiltrate was not related to the oncological treatment, but was due to carcinomatous lymphangitis in relation to tumour progression, the regular evolution and insufficient clinical improvement with the steroid treatment, antibiotic and oxygen therapy support that had been prescribed was explained.

Treatment
The patient progressed favourably, although moderate exertional dyspnoea persisted, although she was discharged home with corticotherapy and oxygen therapy.

Evolution
Given the disease progression demonstrated in the transbronchial biopsy, a third line of treatment with sorafenib 400 mg every 12 hours was started in April 2014. Since then, the patient has shown significant clinical improvement, achieving definitive discontinuation of steroid treatment and oxygen therapy at home. In the radiological studies, the patient showed improvement of the carcinomatous lymphangitis, fulfilling the criteria of stability of the oncological disease.
