Personal history
26-year-old woman of Spanish nationality, with no known drug allergies, toxic habits or previous illnesses. She travelled to Morocco (Tetouan) three years ago, with no apparent health problems.

Current illness
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of our Hospital on 7 July 2001 due to severe polytrauma following a traffic accident, presenting Glasgow 5, multiple fractures (comminuted left femur; open right tibia and fibula and left patella; closed right femur and right olecranon, and complex midfacial fracture with destruction of the floor of the orbit) and several foci of cerebral contusion in the frontal lobe (admission cranial CT scan). On days +0, +2 and +3 of admission, the patient required six surgical interventions by the Traumatology and Maxillofacial Surgery Departments. The patient presented anaemia in the transfusion range that required the administration of fourteen red blood cell concentrates (days +0, +1, +3, +5 and +9) in the first ten days of admission, requiring orotracheal intubation during those days. Two weeks after admission, the patient was admitted to the ward. She then began with repeated episodes of agitation, and on day +30 presented with a significant worsening of her general condition, with high fever (up to 40oC), generalised tonic-clonic seizures, hypotension and anaemia in transfusion range (requiring new transfusions on days +18, +37, +39, +41 and +42). Given the presence of refractory hypotension and a drop in haematocrit on day +44 of admission, an urgent abdominal CT scan was performed, in which several images suggestive of splenic haematomas were detected. An urgent total splenectomy was performed, and the anatomopathological diagnosis was "traumatic splecnitis".
After the operation, the patient continued to present fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotherapy (vancomycin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ceftazidime, cefepime, metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and teicoplanin) and severe anaemia (which required new transfusions on days +45, +47, +66, +70, +74, +89, +94, +104 and +114), without new episodes of seizures. Subsequent analyses showed hyperbilirubinaemia (maximum total bilirubin 7.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.8 mg/dL, with subsequent stabilisation around 2 mg/dL), without significant alterations in the rest of the liver biochemistry, renal function and coagulation studies. Platelets normalised after splenectomy, until day +106, when platelets returned to normal. On day +79 he developed sudden dyspnoea with a bilateral diffuse alveolar alveolar infiltrate (previous chest X-rays had been normal), which resolved in 2-3 days with diuretic and inotropic treatment.

Physical examination
After thirty days of admission, the patient was somnolent, with little response to stimuli. Temperature 39oC; BP 100/60 mmHg. Skin pallor was present and cardiac auscultation was rhythmic, without murmurs at 110 bpm; vesicular murmur was preserved, with no superimposed noises. The abdomen was soft, slightly diffusely painful, with no masses or organomegaly. The extremities were free of oedema and the surgical wounds showed no evidence of superinfection.

Complementary examinations
Laboratory tests on admission (7/7/2001) showed haemoglobin 8.8 g/dL; MCV 88 μm3; haematocrit 24.8%; leukocytes 5,400/μL (83.5% neutrophils, 11.7% lymphocytes and 4.8% monocytes); platelets 89,000, glucose 149 mg/dL; sodium 140 mEq/L; potassium 3.4 mEq/L; chlorine 105 mEq/L. Bilirubin and liver enzymes were normal. Laboratory tests at 38 days of admission were as follows: haemoglobin 5.9 g/dL; leukocytes 6,000 (82% neutrophils; 11.4% lymphocytes, 4.7% monocytes); platelets 45,000; AST 91 IU/L; ALT 101 IU/L; total bilirubin 7.9 mg/dL; (direct 6.1 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase 382 IU/L; GGT 114 IU/L; sodium 129 mEq/L. Coagulation study was normal. As for microbiological isolations, Streptococcus epidermidis was repeatedly isolated from blood (days +19, +46) and maxillary sinus. Azole-resistant Candida spp. were also isolated (in urine, after 50 days of admission, and in catheter tip), Escherichia coli (sputum, blood and catheter tip) and Acinetobacter baumanii (sputum and catheter tip).

Diagnostic test
Peripheral blood smear was performed for anaemia, showing forms compatible with Plasmodium falciparum.

Clinical judgement
Malaria of probable post-transfusion origin due to Plasmodium falciparum.

Evolution
After diagnosis, the patient was treated with quinine hydrochloride (650 mg iv. every eight hours) plus doxycycline (100 mg every twelve hours) for twelve days. After initiation of treatment, the patient remained afebrile and improved clinically, requiring no further transfusions. However, after this period of treatment, parasites continued to be observed in the control thick blood count (day +125). It was therefore decided to treat the patient with mefloquine (750 mg vo. in one dose and 500 mg vo. in another), with negative direct parasitological examination (day +137). The patient was discharged to a physical rehabilitation centre, where she did not develop fever or anaemia again. An exhaustive search was carried out by the Regional Transfusion Centre staff, conducting epidemiological surveys of 61 of the 64 donors of the blood products transfused to the patient (66 red blood cell concentrates, 30 platelet concentrates and 17 plasma units), with no compatible epidemiological data found. Serology for Plasmodium sp. was performed on 64 samples, all of which were negative. Despite the negativity of this search, the origin of the patient's Plasmodium infection was attributed to some of the multiple transfusions received.
