Anamnesis
A 17-year-old male with a history of tension headache. He was a student, of Maghrebi origin and had not travelled outside Spain for years; he denied sexual relations or any other epidemiological data of interest.
She reported left lumbar pain radiating to the anterior aspect of the thigh that subsided at rest, of two weeks' evolution.
She consulted for a sudden worsening of pain, weakness of the lower limbs and a temperature of 39oC. Non-specific headache; no genital, gluteal or lower limb hypoaesthesia. No sphincter alteration or any other clinical manifestations.

Physical examination
Normal cardiorespiratory auscultation and abdominal palpation. Two incarnated toenails of years of evolution with adjacent erythema and pain, without suppuration.
Neurological examination with counter-resistance motor weakness in the left lower limb due to pain on movement; gait with widening of the base. No sensory alterations. Positive LÃ¡segue and Bragard manoeuvres homolaterally. Left patellar reflex slightly hyperexalted, flexor cutaneous-plantar reflexes. No meningeal signs, normal cranial nerves. Rest of neurological examination with no findings.

Emergency Department evolution
Laboratory tests showed peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP) of 311 mg/l, procalcitonin (PCT) of 0.13 ng/ml and 26,000 leukocytes at the expense of neutrophilic polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Chest X-ray was normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine ruled out spondylodiscitis, epidural abscess and spinal canal compression for another cause; left sacroiliac joint oedema with soft tissue involvement compatible with extensive left sacroiliitis was noted.
Empirical antibiotic therapy was therefore started with Linezolid and Ceftriaxone.

Differential Diagnosis
Sacroiliitis.
- Bacterial is the most frequent cause (Brucella, Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomona Aeruginosa, Streptococci, Salmonella, Klebsiella spp).
- Ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, microcrystal arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, Behcet's.
- Paraneoplastic syndromes.
- Isotretinoin.

Evolution Hospitalisation
Growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in two rounds of blood cultures, replacing antibiotherapy with Daptomycin. Negative IGRA test for tuberculosis and Rose Bengal. Transthoracic echocardiogram with no signs of endocarditis.
On reviewing the case, it seemed likely that the origin of the symptoms was superinfection due to poor hygiene of the incarnate nails.
The patient's clinical, analytical and radiological evolution was favourable.

Clinical Judgement
Left sacroiliitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of cutaneous origin.
