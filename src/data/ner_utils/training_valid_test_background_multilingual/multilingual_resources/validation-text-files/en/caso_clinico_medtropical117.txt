Personal history
Male, 35 years old, black, from Nigeria, resident in Spain for four months. He only reported having undergone an appendectomy, but no other pathological history of interest.

Current illness
He referred a picture of diffuse abdominal pain, of one week's evolution and progressive intensity, with occasional nausea and bilious vomiting, constipation and non-thermometric febrile sensation, with profuse sweating. In the last 24 hours she presented intense asthenia and bedridden, which is why she came to the hospital.

Physical examination
Examination showed an axillary temperature of 38oC, blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm and baseline arterial oxygen saturation of 99%. He was in poor general condition, but was oriented and cooperative. He was normonnourished and well hydrated. Oral cavity was normal, no lymph nodes were palpable. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. The abdomen was distended and painful on palpation in the right hypochondrium, with muscular defence and signs of peritonism, without auscultation of intestinal peristalsis. No masses or splenomegaly were palpable. The extremities were normal.

Complementary examinations
The haemogram showed a significant leukocytosis of 26,360 cells/μL (81% neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes, 1% eosinophils). He also had haemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, haematocrit 34% and platelets 333,000/μL. The coagulation study was normal. Biochemistry showed creatinine 1.45 mg/dL, GOT 70 IU/mL, LDH 589 IU/mL. Blood glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, bilirubin, amylase and CPK were normal. Urine sediment showed 10-20 leukocytes per field. Chest X-ray was normal, but abdominal X-ray showed dilated small bowel loops, with no other findings. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the left hepatic lobe, with echogenic material inside, and free fluid in Morrison's space. The abdominal CT scan showed a hypodense mass measuring 7x9 cm in the left hepatic lobe, with peripheral enhancement with contrast and a small hypodense halo, compatible with liver abscess. There was free fluid in the posterior perihepatic space. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic gallbladder and bile duct were normal, as were the spleen, kidneys and bowel loops.

Diagnostic test
Entamoeba histolytica serology (indirect immunofluorescence technique) was positive at a titre of 1/640.

Clinical judgement
Amoebic liver abscess.

Evolution
With the diagnosis of abscess in the left hepatic lobe, large in size, probably complicated and with no possibility of urgent percutaneous drainage, it was decided to perform a laparotomy. During surgery, the presence of an abscess was confirmed in segments III-IV of the liver, opening a window through which purulent chocolate-coloured content came out. A sample was sent to Microbiology and an external drain was placed after washing the cavity. No rupture of the abscess or signs of peritonitis were observed. Subsequently, empirical antibiotic treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam 4-0.5 g every eight hours and metronidazole 750 mg/8 h. iv. After 48 hours the patient was afebrile. Blood cultures and the microbiological study of the liver abscess by Gram stain, Ziehl's stain and culture in aerobic and anaerobic medium were negative.
On the fifth day, in view of the serological findings, the drain was removed and metronidazole was maintained for ten days. Subsequently, he received paromomycin 500 mg/8 h for ten days. At the consultation, one month later, he was asymptomatic.
