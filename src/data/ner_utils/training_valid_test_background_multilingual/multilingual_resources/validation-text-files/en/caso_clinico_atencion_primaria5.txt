Reason for consultation
Perianal pain of one and a half months of evolution and asthenia.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests).
We first saw a 20-year-old male patient in primary care for perianal pain of one and a half months' duration associated with intermittent pruritus and, since the last week, asthenia. He had made previous visits for the reason described above, and had been treated to date with topical nitroglycerine, topical mupirocin and topical corticosteroids after initially being diagnosed as a perianal fistula. On this occasion, the patient presented with persistent symptoms and requested a referral to general surgery for assessment in specialised care.

Before considering a hospital referral, a new anamnesis was performed to reorientate the possible differential diagnosis, and an approach to sexual behaviour and habits was carried out. The patient was a male of homosexual orientation, with no regular partner. Since the age of 16 (the age of his first sexual relationship), he has had sexual relations with more than 20 men per year without using a condom. He is involved in cruising and sexual exchanges. In addition, during the anamnesis, our patient reported always performing and receiving oral sex with the other contacts without using a barrier method, as well as being more often passive than active in his sexual relations. Finally, he denied the use of toxic habits and other diseases of interest.

On further examination, after reorienting the possible diagnosis, there was a perianal ulcerated lesion at 12 hours, slightly hypertrophic with a clean, indurated background, a left inguinal lymphadenopathy measuring 2-3 centimetres in size and non-painful aphthae (not previously perceived by the patient) on the lower gingival oral mucosa.

Given the diagnostic orientation of sexually transmitted infection, a diagnostic study was requested with blood serology (syphilis, HIV and hepatotropic viruses) and PCRs for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma Genitalium and Gonococcus in pharynx, urine and anus. Finally, a sample was taken from the perianal ulcer to amplify a PCR for Chlamydia (serotypes Lymphogranuloma venereum - L1, L2 and L3) and Herpes Simplex Virus.

The analytical results showed the following findings:
Urine: Myclopasma positive, rest negative.
Pharynx: Gonococcus and Chlamydia negative.
Anus: Myclopasma, chlamydia and gonococcus negative.
Serology: EIAg positive, RPR/VDRL 1/8, HIV negative. Hepatitis B virus (antiHbs: 93.5). Hepatitis A virus (IgG) positive, hepatitis C virus (IgG) negative.
Ulcer: PCR negative for Chlamydia and HSV.

Clinical judgement (problem list, differential diagnosis)
The patient was diagnosed with primary syphilis and mycoplasma genitalium infection (asymptomatic) after diagnostic tests.

Action plan and evolution
Treatment was started with Penicillin G benzathine 2,400,000 U intramuscular (single dose) and azithromycin 500 mg vo single dose + 250 mg/24 hours/4 days. The patient is now feeling better, the symptoms have subsided and the perianal ulcer has almost completely reduced in size. In addition, the patient's sexual contacts for the 3 months prior to the onset of symptoms have been studied and treated. In the next visits to the clinic, follow-up with non-treponemal tests (VDRL or RPR) will be carried out at one month, three months and then at 6 and 12 months after the first dose of treatment.
