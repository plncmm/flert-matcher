A 67-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a two-day history of fever, chills and low back pain with mechanical features that did not radiate to the lower limbs. His personal history included the existence of AHT treated with candesartan, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, diverticulosis of the sigma and placement of a St Jude prosthesis 5 years earlier due to severe mitral insufficiency.
The general physical examination showed no significant alterations, nor did he have neurological deficits. The patient lived in a rural area and lived with several domestic animals, although on questioning he reported no previous bites or scratches.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis with left shift (15,100 leukocytes/mm3, 11,630 neutrophils/mm3, 1,060 white blood cells/mm3). Fresh examination of blood cultures showed coccobacilli which stained negative on Gram stain. Blood cultures were seeded on blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar plates, and growth of grey, smooth, non-hemolytic colonies was obtained on the first two plates. Biochemical tests performed with the API2ONE system (Biomérieux) resulted in the identification of Pasteurella pneumotropica (P. pneumotropica), confirmed at the National Microbiology Centre. Oxidase, catalase, indole and urease reactions were positive, produced decarboxylation of ornithine, acidification of xylose, maltose and sucrose and reduced nitrates to nitrites.
The organism was sensitive to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 8), cephalosporins (cephalothin ≤ 8, cefuroxime ≤ 4, cefotaxime ≤ 1), aminoglycosides (gentamicin ≤ 4), quinolones (ciprofloxacin ≤ 0.12) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (≤ 2/38). MRI of the lumbar spine showed an anterior epidural abscess at L4-L5 level, with involvement of the left psoas-iliac muscle, as well as the inferior plateau of L5 and superior plateau of S1. Treatment with ciprofloxacin was prescribed for 4 weeks, intravenously for the first week (400mg/12 hours), and then orally (750mg/12 hours). Surgical or percutaneous drainage of the abscesses was not necessary. The clinical evolution was favourable with complete resolution of the symptoms, and a subsequent MRI performed 6 weeks later confirmed the resolution of the abscesses previously described.
