Anamnesis
A 26-year-old man with no previous history of interest came to the Emergency Department, after several occasions, for pain in the hypogastrium, radiating to the FID and lumbar region. He related it to persistent constipation requiring enemas and laxatives, of 2-3 weeks' evolution. She reports a weight loss of about 5 kg in the last 2 months. She has no other B symptoms.

Physical examination
No relevant physical findings, except for abdominal palpation with generalised pain. Hepatic rim between 2-3 cm with nodulations, indurated. There was also a palpable mass at the level of the FID. The rest of the examination showed no relevant findings.
For all these reasons, the patient was admitted to hospital for further investigation.

Complementary tests
"Biochemistry: BT 1.34, GOT 81, GPT 140, GGT 246, FA 154, LDH 716.
"Haemogram: Hb 15.8, leukocytes 11,620, PMN 74 %, platelets 238,000. Coagulation: PT 51 %, INR 1.62.
"Normal thyroid profile. HIV serology, IGRA and hepatotropic virus negative. betaHCG < 1.2.
"MT: elevation CA 125 121.1 (0.5-35); AFP, CEA, CA 15.3 CA 19.9, S-100b protein and PSA within normal.
"Proteinogram within normality. Discrete elevation of IgE.
"With regard to the imaging tests, the abdominal ultrasound scan showed multiple lesions compatible with metastatic disease in the liver, pelvis, probably lymph nodes and hepatic hilum secondary to unidentified neoplasia.
"A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed several pelvic peritoneal masses, as well as lesions with peripheral uptake ring suggestive of liver metastases.
"Core needle biopsy of the inguinal mass was performed and finally reported as a desmoplastic small round cell tumour.
"Cylinders infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation forming nests and trabeculae of small undifferentiated round cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm in a desmoplastic fibrous stroma with myxoid change.
"Cells immunophenotype positive for desmin (with perinuclear dot pattern), vimentin, weak enolase, CK AE1/AE3 and weak CD99, and negative for myogenin protein, S100, CD56 and synaptophysin.
"Molecular biology study, subsequently reported, is positive for EWSR1 translocation.
"FISH is positive for translocation of the EWSR1 gene locus (22q12.2).
"Immunohistochemical study of WT1 shows intense positivity.
"Subsequently, the patient is discharged home after biopsy.
"He was re-admitted for abdominal pain, refractory to analgesic treatment. Symptomatic control and completion of the extension study were therefore carried out.
"Bone scan with no evidence of metastatic bone involvement. Ventriculography with LVEF at the limit of normality.

Diagnosis
Desmoplastic small round cell tumour.

Treatment
The strategy proposed was to start chemotherapy treatment with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine for six cycles. After three cycles, the patient was admitted to hospital for pustular tonsillitis, febrile neutropenia GIV, thrombopenia GIII, and GI oromucositis. Finally, he completes the remaining three cycles.
In the radiological evaluation at six months, the following stand out:
"MRI abdomen and pelvis: marked partial response of the peritoneal lesion, as well as liver metastases.
"Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan: significant reduction in number and size of primary pelvic lesions and liver metastases. Disappearance of mesenteric and retroperitoneal adenopathies. Partial response to treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria for primary and metastatic disease.

Evolution
Given the response to treatment, the case was presented to the Multidisciplinary Committee for surgical assessment. R0 surgery was not guaranteed, so it was decided to continue chemotherapy treatment with ifosfamide-etoposide for three more cycles.
After completing them, it was decided to consult with the Spanish Sarcoma Research Group (GEIS), which recommended completing the year of treatment with chemotherapy and re-evaluating and trying local techniques.
After completing the ifosfamide-etoposide regimen, rescue surgery was performed. Postoperative evolution was favourable, and the patient was discharged home after a week in hospital.
The case was presented again to the Tumour Committee, specifying that the resection had been R2, leaving all the liver disease unresectable and a tumour pellet in the right pelvic region.
Three months later, the patient was again admitted to the Medical Oncology Department for deterioration of general condition, tension ascites and liver failure due to tumour progression.
PET-CT scan: dissemination of liver and peritoneal metastases, retroperitoneal adenopathies and incipient pulmonary metastases, all suggestive of tumour progression.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: tumour progression with liver metastases. Evidence of peritoneal implants and presence of necrotic adenopathy in pararectal fat.
Finally, given the patient's condition, it was decided to initiate comfort measures, with evacuation paracentesis and analgesic perfusion to control the pain. One week later, the patient died.
