A 50-year-old man on maintenance haemodialysis presented to the emergency department with a non-productive cough of 7 days' duration. His past history included renal failure due to diabetes, which was treated with outpatient haemodialysis three times a week, hypertension and chronic infection with hepatitis B virus. An epidemiological evaluation revealed that he had travelled to Wuhan in mid-January 2020, visited relatives and returned to Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province, China, one week later.
 The patient was admitted to hospital two weeks later with hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation of 90% in room air) without fever or myalgia. Physical examination showed a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure 184/107 mmHg, pulse 74 bpm and normal bilateral breath sounds. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 3.38 × 109/L with 77.5% neutrophils, 15.7% lymphocytes and 0% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin values were 40.1 mg/L and 0.73 ng/mL, respectively. Liver capacity and cardiac enzyme values were within normal ranges. A chest CT scan revealed multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities. The Guangdong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were positive twice in pharyngeal swab specimens. Based on the epidemiological characteristics and these results, the diagnosis was COVID-19 pneumonia.
 As soon as COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, the patient was transferred to a specialised hospital and received haemodialysis in a room with isolation equipment designed for COVID-19 patients, where all haemodialysis patients wear a mask during dialysis, including the other 42 patients who had possible exposure to patients with atypical symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Although the patient did not have the usual symptoms such as fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache or myalgia, he did have cough and dyspnoea; consequently, the patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at admission and at 14 days, with negative results in both cases. Because of the precautions taken by the medical team, SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed on the staff, which were negative, and they were not isolated.
 The patient was treated with nasal cannula oxygen therapy, regular haemodialysis, antihypertensives, moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) and antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (2 tablets twice daily). None of the possible side effects of lopinavir/ritonavir during treatment, such as nausea, diarrhoea and occasional dizziness, were observed. After 8 days of treatment, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative twice in throat swabs, cough had subsided and analytical tests and chest CT images showed improvement. The patient was discharged from hospital.
