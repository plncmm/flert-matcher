A 20-year-old second-gestation pregnant woman, without symptoms of COVID-19, attended another hospital for delivery at 39 weeks' gestation. She was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR because her father had been diagnosed with COVID-19 a week earlier. The mother wore a surgical mask during the normal vaginal delivery, where she gave birth to a 2,980 g (normal for her gestational age) baby boy. In the meantime, testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was positive, so mother and child were separated immediately after delivery. The mother therefore had no contact with the child after birth. Both were transferred to our hospital 8 hours after delivery, with a diagnosis of subclinical COVID-19 by the mother, on 5 April 2020.
The infant was admitted to the neonatal ICU, while the mother was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab obtained from the infant on admission (8-10 hours after birth) was negative. The mother and child were cared for in different clinical units, to avoid mutual contact until discharge. In addition, the child did not come into contact with any other family members until discharge. Both mother and child were in good health, with no fever or other symptoms during their hospital stay. Their vital signs were stable and oxygen saturation was 98-99%.
Health professionals, with strict precautionary measures (hands, hygiene, mask, etc.) gave the baby freshly expressed breast milk (unpasteurised and unfrozen) 24 hours after admission, on 6 April 2020. Meanwhile, after the first lactation, a breast milk sample was sent to the virology department of Ankara University for SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR. The result was positive, at which point breast milk feeding was discontinued. Breast milk samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 over the next two days to determine the time course of virus presence.
The infant received a total of ∼240 cc of breast milk in the first 36 hours of life. As the infant received breast milk for 24-36 hours until receipt of PCR test results from the mother, blood, stool and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from the infant at 96 hours of age for PCR testing.
One-step PCR targeting the S gene showed nearly equal viral loads in milk samples obtained on days 5, 8 and 9 (cycle threshold [Ct]: 29.20, 28.85, 32.28, respectively). The Ct values of the child's nasopharyngeal swab, blood and stool samples obtained on 9 April were 32.71, 33.10 and 32.84, respectively.
During follow-up, neither the mother nor the child showed symptoms requiring intervention or treatment. Five days after admission, the mother was encouraged to breastfeed the child taking the necessary precautions; both were discharged from the hospital. In a telephone follow-up 2 weeks after discharge (day 19 since birth), mother and child were in good health, with no symptoms of COVID-19. The comforting outcome in this child may have been secondary to the protective effect of breast milk.
