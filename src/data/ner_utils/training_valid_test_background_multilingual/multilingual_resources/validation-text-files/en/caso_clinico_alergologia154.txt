An 11-year-old boy with perennial rhinoconjunctivitis and episodic asthma, with no underlying treatment.
He consulted for 2 recent episodes of anaphylaxis (urticaria and bronchospasm) while exercising, preceded by the ingestion of Chips on one occasion and a chicken hamburger on the second.
Subsequently, he suffered another anaphylaxis, following soup with soya oil, without physical exercise.
Positive skin tests: grasses, olive, weeds, mites and fungi, legumes and soya. Peanut negative, but prick-prick positive. LTP, profilin, polcalcin and birch negative.
Specific IgE: legumes negative, except peanut (0.39 kU/L). rPru p3, rBet v1, rAra h1/h2/h3 and rTri a19 negative.
SDS-PAGE Blotting (patient serum-raw peanut extract): protein binding of 16, 18, 23, 30, 45 kDa.
The following are identified as peanut allergens with molecular mass 16-18 kDa: Ara h2 (Conglutinin), Ara h8 (PR-10), Ara h10/h14/h15 (Oleosins); no allergens with molecular mass 23,30,45 kDa are described. Oleosins in SDS-PAGE assays usually migrate as monomers (16-18 kDa bands) or aggregates (heavier bands).
In the foods implicated in the patient's reactions, the common possible allergenic source is soybean oil, and it could be its oleosin, the protein responsible for anaphylaxis.
