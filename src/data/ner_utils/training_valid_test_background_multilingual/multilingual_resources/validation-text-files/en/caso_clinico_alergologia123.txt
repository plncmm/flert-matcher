A 10-year-old patient with a personal history of well-controlled bronchial asthma and urticaria treated with antihistamines who in 2014 presented two episodes of urticaria and bronchospasm while playing tennis, in the absence of cofactors. An immunoallergic analytical study was performed, finding only elevated IgE specific to mites, grasses and olive trees. The dose of antihistamine was increased and adrenaline auto-injector was prescribed. Given the persistence of clinical symptoms, it was decided to start Omalizumab 300 mg/4 weeks. Two years after the start of treatment, the patient was exercising normally for his age, and it was decided to space out Omalizumab, with the last dose being administered in December 2017. He has not suffered any new episodes of anaphylaxis in these years.
