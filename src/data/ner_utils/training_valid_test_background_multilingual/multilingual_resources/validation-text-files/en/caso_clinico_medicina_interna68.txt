Clinical history. Anamnesis
The patient was a young woman aged 19 years who came to the Internal Medicine department referred from the Emergency Department for evaluation of multiple skin rashes in different phases, painful, focused on the right ankle together with arthralgia, of months of evolution. There was no apparent trigger or recent infectious process. Afebrile. No clear gastrointestinal or respiratory history or arthropod bites. No other accompanying clinical manifestations.

Personal and/or family history
No known AMR. No toxic habits. No medical illnesses of interest A history of rheumatic disease in first-degree relatives was excluded.

Physical examination
Patient in good general condition. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Normal vital signs. Afebrile. Well hydrated and perfused. No cervical adenopathies. Eupneic. PCA: Pure and rhythmic tones. Bladder murmur preserved. Abdomen: Anodyne. On the lower limbs, there were indurated, slightly exudative, painful plaques with central vesiculation, coalescing between them, distributed ventrally and bilaterally on both lower limbs. No plantar lesions or other findings.

Complementary tests
- CBC: Blood count was unremarkable. A somewhat elevated glomerular sedimentation rate (ESR): 14/46. Coagulation was normal. Biochemistry: glucose, renal function, total bilirubin, GOT, GPT, GGT, LDH, FA, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulins, complement, CRP, RF and proteinogram within normality. Negative antiphospholipid antibodies, negative ANA and antiDNA.
- Mantoux negative. Chest X-ray: anodine.
- Chest CT scan: high density millimetric nodule in left lower lobe, compatible with granuloma, non-specific.
- ANCA negative, collagenosis ruled out, ASLO negative.
- Spirometry with FEV1: 77%; FVC: 78%; IT: 0.81.
- Pathological anatomy (biopsy of the lesion): upper dermal oedema with dense inflammatory infiltrate of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (suggesting the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome and ruling out primary cutaneous lymphoma or underlying infection.

Differential diagnosis in the emergency department and/or in internal medicine and dermatology consultations: cutaneous infection (fungal and mycobacterial), pyoderma gangrenosum, primary Kaposi's sarcoma, vasculitis (cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis), erythema nodosum...

Final diagnosis
Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis).

Evolution
During admission, the patient was referred to the Dermatology Department with an initial diagnosis of erythema nodosum due to reactivation, from where a biopsy of the lesion was requested, confirming the diagnosis of Sweet's Syndrome. After screening for underlying malignancy, immunosuppression treatment was started with systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone 5 mg/24 h oral initially, which was increased to 25 mg/24 h oral) to which indomethacin (25 mg/12 h oral) was added later, without success. After a few months, the patient presented poor clinical evolution of these lesions with ulceration and colchicine (2 mg/24 h oral) and a 2-week course of doxycycline (100 mg/12 h, oral) were added to the treatment, obtaining a slight improvement. Later colchicine had to be withdrawn due to the patient's intolerance, and corticotherapy (prednisone 25 mg/24h, oral) was continued. After review of the biopsy by dermatology and confirmation of the diagnosis of SS, the patient started treatment with ciclosporin A at a dose of 3.5mg/kg/day, while starting a tapering course of corticosteroids until reaching a minimum dose of 5mg of prednisone per day. After 10 weeks of treatment, the patient had excellent renal function and tolerance to the drug. She is currently maintained on this dose and has been free of active lesions since week 3 of this therapy, with a clear improvement since week 5.
