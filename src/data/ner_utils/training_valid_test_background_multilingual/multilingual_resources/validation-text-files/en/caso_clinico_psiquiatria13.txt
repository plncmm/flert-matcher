Male, 15 years old, single. He lives with his mother, her new partner (for the last 5 years) and their 3 year old daughter. The 4 of them live together with a 13 year old daughter of his first wife. Parents separated 8 years ago. His father remarried 3 years ago, and has an 8 month old baby. He studies 2nd year of Compulsory Secondary Education. He has repeated the last 2 years. He had previously been a good student. Reason for consultation He comes for treatment to the Adolescent and Family Support Programme of Proyecto Hombre (Madrid) at the request of his parents (mainly his mother), as he does not consider himself to have any problems. The mother requests treatment for cannabis and alcohol consumption, together with significant behavioural problems in the family, school and social spheres. Current illness He starts using tobacco around the age of 12, and almost immediately after that he starts using alcohol and cannabis. While alcohol consumption continues on some weekends ("botell√≥n"), tobacco and cannabis consumption is daily almost from the beginning, generally with "peers" older than him, in the park near his home. At the age of 11 he goes to a gym to lose weight, exercise and socialise. There he practises kick boxing, excelling in this sport. He befriends the trainer and a group of peers, who engage in marginalised behaviour, with whom he is initiated into substance abuse and criminal activities. He was a "chubby" boy, with glasses, with a complex about it. He had few friends at school. At around 12-13 years of age he used contact lenses and had a "growth spurt", during the period he attended the gym, becoming a "handsome" adolescent. At the age of 13, daily cannabis use also takes place at school (between classes) with an average dose of 4-6 joints/day, which leads to a significant drop in school performance (which until then had been adequate) and behavioural disturbances at school (absenteeism, expulsions due to use, confrontations with teachers, etc.). At 13-14 years of age, the parents are aware of his cannabis use, but in a much smaller quantity than what he has consumed, given that he systematically denies it, and only accepts smoking occasionally. Behavioural disorders begin at home, in relation to problems at school and the lies he makes to hide his absenteeism, and the economic income he has from his criminal activities (theft of mobile phones, copper, building materials, to sell them later). He leaves the gymnasium although he continues to frequent some of his companions. They contact a mental health centre and a centre for drug addicts in the area. The problems continue as the adolescent refuses to collaborate (he does not attend appointments, runs away from the centre or takes a passive and minimising attitude). At the age of 14, behavioural problems worsen, both at school and at home. He is expelled from his second school (his parents had changed him at the beginning of the school year, due to the problems at the first school). He receives weekly treatment with a private psychologist for 1 year, during which his behavioural problems continue to worsen. Living together at home is very difficult, with significant verbal violence towards the mother, and physical violence against objects. He repeatedly runs away from the family home, disappearing for up to 3 days. On his return, he justifies his behaviour by the limits they try to impose on him, without any sense of guilt. His only interest is to be in the park with his friends and "do whatever he wants with his body". His approach to life is to live as some of his peers do "without working and on the side". He does not accept his mother's authority regarding timetables, homework.... He agrees to start the school year, but on the first day he is expelled for smoking cannabis on school grounds. During the month prior to the request for treatment, he moved to live at his father's house, where he stayed for 10 days, in the face of his father's wife's approach, who did not tolerate his behaviour, given the verbal violence he used when he was opposed and the open confrontation with her. He returned to his mother's home and after police intervention (complaint by his mother for absconding) he agreed to go to treatment, faced with the threat of involving the Community of Madrid in his custody. The confrontations with her mother and her partner increase ("he is not my father, and he is not going to act like one"). The mother says that she tries to stay out of it, but she cannot tolerate the insults, disqualifications towards her..., and the adolescent continually challenges her. In the days prior to treatment, the mother's partner had left home as she could not stand living with the patient.


Personal and family background
He maintains a friendly relationship with his father (40 years old, works as a technician in a company). The stepfather's daughter with whom she lives with is described as a "model child" both at school and at home. Mother, 42 years old, works as an administrative assistant. Currently unemployed. Parents separated 8 years ago. The separation was amicable with regard to visiting arrangements, etc. The father sees his son more frequently than the visiting arrangements. In the last 2 years, due to the father's marriage and the poor relationship with the father's wife, visits have been spaced out. They have no psychiatric history, except that both have a tobacco dependency, smoking around 20 cigarettes/day. Pregnancy, birth and psychomotor development normal. She attended nursery and later school and adapted well to them. She passed the school years adequately, until the age of 12, when she started using tobacco and stopped school activities. He did not present behavioural disorders, nor data suggesting ADHD. He was a self-conscious child, smaller than his peers..., with few friends. Bad at sports until he contacted martial arts, around the age of 12, where he stood out. Important change of character since then. He is defined as intelligent and responsible in his tasks until the age of 11-12, with a verbal language from an early age more advanced than expected for his age and seductive when he wants something..... The father maintains a "friendly" relationship with him. He discusses everything, and does not impose himself. The mother has also participated in this educational style. Now the mother is the "rigid" one, and blames the father for not supporting her in setting limits, disallowing her, and not having imposed herself when behavioural disorders started. In the last 2 years this has been a major source of friction between them.

Differential diagnosis
Meets criteria for Cannabis Dependence F12.2. (ICD 10). The characteristic manifestation of the dependence syndrome is the desire to ingest the substance. The patient states this, saying that it "calms him down" and helps him to be with his friends. Being with them and the behaviour they engage in is really the only thing that motivates him, abandoning other diversions or sources of pleasure. She denies any desire to reduce or stop consumption, as she does not consider it "a problem, she likes it and it is not harmful". The mother reports intense nervousness when she cannot leave the house and smoke. She has been smoking 4-6 joints/day for 2 years, and in the last year up to 9 joints/day. She meets the criteria for nicotine dependence, smoking around 10 tobacco cigarettes a day. He has harmful alcohol consumption, with disruptive behaviour when he has been drinking. However, he considers that he "doesn't like it very much", and can go without drinking. The patient's behaviour suggests a possible diagnosis of psychopathic personality disorder, given his indifference to the consequences of his actions, his lack of feelings of guilt, his involvement in dangerous behaviours... However, the age of the patient means that this diagnosis cannot be made. It is also questioned by the fact that up to the age of 12 his behaviour was completely normal and he did not show any psychopathic traits.

The behaviours he presents seem to be framed within:
- substance use, and the world around him, with friends older than him, users and with sociopathic behaviours in some of them
- In the family assessment carried out by the device for Adolescents and Families of Proyecto Hombre, risk factors that encourage substance abuse and disruptive behaviour are detected within the family system, such as the lack of social skills of both parents, hostility and marital competitiveness, the existence of family conflict between them, the inadequate supervision and monitoring of the minor. In terms of regulations, the existence of unclear limits, inadequate control and supervision of the child, inadequate and non-contingent punishment, lack of parental coherence and parental disagreement were observed. In terms of family communication style, the family has a passive and/or aggressive communication style, the father has a passive and/or aggressive communication style, the father has a passive and/or aggressive communication style, the father has a passive and/or aggressive communication style, the father has a passive
- absent, while the mother is excessively controlling and aggressive. Inadequate active and empathic listening is also observed, with poor expression of feelings and self messages. For all these reasons, they were recommended to go to Family Mediation from the device in order to be able to negotiate agreements regarding the rules of coexistence, while they continue to attend psychiatry and psychology appointments. When the family situation and the child's situation has stabilised, work will continue in group therapy.
