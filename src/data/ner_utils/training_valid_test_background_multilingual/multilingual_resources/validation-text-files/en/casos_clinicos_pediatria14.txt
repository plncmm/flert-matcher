Eight-year-old girl, from the province of Huesca (Spain), with no past history of interest, came to the clinic with a dermal lesion on the scalp and cervico-occipital lymphadenopathy of several days' evolution. Examination revealed a crusty lesion on the occipital scalp, measuring 3 Ã— 3 cm, which was easily removed, with no eschar or erythematous area. There were also three retroauricular and occipital lymphadenopathies, 2 cm in diameter, very painful on palpation, with no other findings of interest. The patient reported a tick bite 15 days ago, which was identified as Dermacentor marginatus.

Erythromycin was prescribed at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day for eight days and serology was requested for Toxoplasma, Borrelia, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and Rickettsia conorii, showing positive IgG for cytomegalovirus and antibodies to Rickettsia conorii (1/640) by indirect inmonofluorescence and subsequent increase after 40 days. After the prescribed medication, one of the three lymphadenopathies persisted for a month, which continued to be painful to the touch, and subsequently disappeared. Four years later, having been asymptomatic during this period, the patient consulted for the reappearance of small nodules that were mildly painful to palpation in the bilateral cranio-cervical region. Ultrasound scans revealed four lesions compatible with residual inflammatory lymphadenopathies with no other significant findings, none of them of significant size, which were treated symptomatically.
