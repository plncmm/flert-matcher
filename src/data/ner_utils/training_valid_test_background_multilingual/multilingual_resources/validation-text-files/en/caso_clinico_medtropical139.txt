Personal history
Patient from Mali who had been living in Spain for two years. Arrived in Spain by boat in the Canary Islands, from where she travelled to Barcelona and from there to Almeria. She has not returned to her country since then. He had had unprotected sexual relations on his arrival in Spain and was a regular smoker and drinker.

Current illness
Constitutional syndrome of four months of evolution, with anorexia, weight loss and abdominal pain.

Physical examination
Black patient, with extreme cachexia. She had ulcerated mucositis on the tongue and lips, hepatosplenomegaly, without ascites, oedema in the lower limbs up to the knees and ulcerated haemorrhoids. He also had hyperpigmented papulo-nodular lesions on the trunk and root of the lower limbs.

Complementary examinations
The haemogram showed the presence of significant hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 6.9 g/dL). Biochemical analysis showed sodium 125 mmol/L, total cholesterol 75 mg/dL, GOT 120 IU/L, GGT 69 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 212 IU/L, LDH 791 IU/L, total protein 8.1 g/dL, iron 13 μg/dL, ferritin 17,100 ng/dL, transferrin saturation index 10%, albumin 2.4 g/dL and C-reactive protein 23 mg/dL. The proteinogram showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
Serology for hepatitis B virus (compatible with past infection) and C virus (negative) was performed. Treponemal tests were positive (with negative reagin tests) and serology for cytomegalovirus was negative.
She was positive for IgM against Epstein-Barr virus and IgG against Toxoplasma gondii. IgG against lymphatic filariasis was determined, with a low positive result (IgG 1 and 3 low positive and IgG 2 and 4 negative). Strongyloides serology was negative and Schistosoma low positive. Mantoux intradermal reaction was positive (10 mm).

Diagnostic test
HIV serology positive

Clinical judgement
High suspicion of Kaposi's sarcoma associated with HIV infection.

Progress
Viral load (2,929,840 copies/mL) and lymphocyte subpopulation count (16 CD4+/μL) were determined. Combined antiretroviral therapy was initiated with excellent subsequent evolution, complete resolution of Kaposi's lesions and weight gain of more than 20 kg.
