41-year-old woman, single, childless, lives alone. She is a music teacher, currently not working, and is preparing for the competitive exams for intermediate level education.

Reason for consultation
She has had several episodes of panic attacks in recent months, during abstinence or reduction of cannabis consumption, with great discomfort and concern about the consequences they cause her.

Current Illness
He started using cannabis as an adolescent, mainly at weekends, and in adulthood he started using cannabis daily at a rate of 2-3 joints/day, generally at night, in order to "relax". In the last 2 years, her consumption has been increasing, and in recent months, coinciding with a failed relationship and a drastic change in her life (returning to her hometown and preparing for a competitive examination to become a teacher, studying at home during the working day), she consumes around 8-10 joints a day. Smokes 20-30 tobacco cigarettes/day. Occasional drinker. No other consumption. She also reports a high level of anxiety, worry about the future and restlessness in relation to her life situation. In relation to the increase in cannabis consumption, she has difficulty concentrating on her studies, which she experiences with guilt and which generates more "anxiety". She therefore decided to limit its use, and within hours of abstinence she presented an episode of palpitations, cold sweats, dizziness, a feeling of chest tightness and fear of dying which, after going to A&E and ruling out organic pathology, was diagnosed as a panic attack and referred to her family doctor. No urine toxicity tests were performed and the patient did not report cannabis use. She started using again to "relax" and mitigate her baseline anxiety, but due to the persistent difficulty in concentrating, she tried to reduce her consumption from 7-9 joints/day to 2-3 at night, and a new panic attack occurred. The patient clearly related it to cannabis withdrawal, and went to the emergency department again. During the following weeks, she became fearful about the possibility of a repetition of the attacks, worried about their consequences, her inability to reduce consumption without anxiety, and her difficulty in concentrating on her studies. He therefore decided to abandon his work plan, continued to use, did not take the medical treatment prescribed by the emergency room and confined himself to his home. In the following 2 months he had 3 similar crises when he tried to reduce his consumption on his own. She developed depressive symptoms after these crises (sadness, early awakening and diurnal mood swings). At this point she decided to ask for help and to seek treatment for her cannabis dependence and her panic attacks.


Personal and family history
She is the third of 5 siblings. Father died 7 years ago. Mother 76 years old, diagnosed with dysthymia. No siblings who use cannabis. Previous personality: "restless", "rebellious". Left the family home at the age of 20, continuing her music studies, and subsequently doing odd jobs in many different places. She has had several romantic partners, the last one for 7 years. A few months ago she moved back to her home town and decided to prepare for competitive examinations in order to have a stable job.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis
The criteria for "Cannabis dependence F12.2" are fulfilled. The characteristic manifestation of the dependence syndrome is the desire to ingest the substance. Subjective awareness of the compulsion to use usually occurs when attempts are made to stop or control the use of the substance. The patient has exhibited, in the previous 12 months or on a continuous basis, three or more of the following features: a) Intense craving or experience of a compulsion to use b) Decreased ability to control use c) Somatic symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome when substance use is reduced or ceases, as confirmed by: withdrawal symptoms characteristic of the substance or use of the substance with the intention of relieving or avoiding withdrawal symptoms d) Tolerance, such that a progressive increase in the dose of the substance is required to achieve the same effects as originally produced by lower doses e) Progressive withdrawal from other sources of pleasure or diversion, (f) Persistence in the use of the substance in spite of the obvious harmful consequences of the use of the substance. 8 (panic attacks)'. This heading includes disorders in which cannabis use can be identified as being directly responsible for the clinical picture that contributes to the situation, but in which there are not sufficient patterns to be included in any of the preceding disorders. We can make the differential diagnosis with "Panic disorder (episodic paroxysmal anxiety) F41.0". Its essential characteristic is the presence of recurrent crises of severe anxiety (panic) not limited to any particular situation or set of circumstances. They are therefore unpredictable. As in other anxiety disorders, the predominant symptoms vary from case to case, but sudden onset of palpitations, precordial pain, a feeling of suffocation, dizziness or lightheadedness and a sense of unreality are common. Almost constantly there is a secondary fear of dying, losing control or going mad. Each seizure usually lasts only a few minutes, but may also persist longer. Both the frequency and the course of the disorder, which predominantly affects women, are quite variable. Often the fear and vegetative symptoms of the attack grow in such a way that the sufferers eventually leave, escape, from where they are. A panic attack is often followed by a persistent fear of having another panic attack. However, we should not make this diagnosis per se, as they are not unpredictable, but appear secondary to substance withdrawal.


Treatment
Clonazepam 2.5 mg/day in three doses and sertraline up to 200 mg/day in two doses were prescribed. She was included in a psychotherapeutic programme, with detailed information about false beliefs when misinterpreting moderate bodily sensations as indicative of a panic attack, real information about them, she was included in a programme of controlled breathing and relaxation techniques. After improving her baseline level of anxiety, no panic attacks on quitting cannabis and resumption of her work duties, the patient voluntarily left treatment after 2 months. After one year, the family reports that she has returned to occasional cannabis use with her new partner. For the time being, she has not had any new crises.
