73-year-old woman with stage 3 CKD, a history of cholelithiasis and chronic atrophic gastritis, operated on in 2016 for ascending aortic aneurysm with placement of an aortic prosthesis in 2016, referred for constitutional symptoms with loss of about 15 kg in the last 9 months and postingesta epigastralgia. Laboratory tests showed progressive anaemia and deterioration of renal function. She had previously undergone a thoracoabdomino-pelvic CT scan, colonoscopy and gastroscopy with no pathological findings.
During admission, mild hypergammaglobulinaemia was observed with low titre positive ANA without antigenic specificity. Rectal biopsy was negative for amyloidosis. An echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound and PET-CT scan were performed with no significant findings. Blood cultures, viral serology and quantiferon were requested and were negative.
Since admission, acute deterioration of renal function associated with proteinuria in non-nephrotic range, so it was decided to perform a renal biopsy and haemodialysis was started, with poor tolerance to the sessions due to febrile peaks with haemodynamic deterioration. In addition, respiratory failure began, with the appearance of dry bibasal crackles and bilateral intersticioalveolar pattern in the X-ray. A chest CT scan was requested, showing a cobblestone pattern in the middle and upper fields. LBA was performed with negative PCR for mycobacteria and transbronchial lung biopsy.
Finally, the renal biopsy was reported as non-necrotising granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Subsequently, granulomas and multinucleated giant cells were also detected in the lung biopsy.
In view of the systemic granulomatous disease, ACE was requested, which was reduced in blood and blood cultures were requested for mycobacteria. It was decided to start corticosteroids and, despite the negative PCR for mycobacteria, empirical tuberculostatics were started due to a history of treated latent tuberculosis infection. Days later, Mycobacterium chimaera was isolated in blood cultures and antibiotic therapy was adjusted to the antibiogram. In the following weeks the fever and respiratory failure disappeared, but haemodialysis was still required due to established renal damage.
Mycobacteria chimaera is an atypical mycobacterium that was associated in 2012 with infection in patients with previous cardiac surgery. It is found in the thermal control system of extracorporeal circulation and is transmitted by aerosolisation. The unspecificity of the clinical manifestations, the long latency period and the difficulty of isolation and characterisation by specific microbiological techniques lead to a significant delay in diagnosis, resulting in high mortality.
