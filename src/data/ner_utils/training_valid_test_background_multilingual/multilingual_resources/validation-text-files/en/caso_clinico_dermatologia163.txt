Anamnesis
A 59-year-old woman with no history of interest or known pharmacological allergies, presenting with acute low back pain, for which she had received daily dexketoprofen until 10 days ago for 12 days, and etoricoxib for 9 days and diazepam for 22 days. She presented to the emergency department with very pruritic skin lesions on the head, trunk and upper limbs in the last 24 hours, accompanied by fever. He presented leukocytosis with neutrophilia (13220 leukocytes/ul with 11540 neutrophils/ul), without eosinophilia. The picture was interpreted as toxicoderma, so the drugs he was taking were suspended and he was started on prednisone 10 mg/day and topical methylprednisolone aceponate every 12 hours. Forty-eight hours later the lesions had progressed in a craniocaudal direction and were accompanied by fever of up to 39.5oC with no evidence of an infectious focus, so hospital admission was decided.

Physical examination
At this time he was in good general condition, and erythematous oedematous lesions, some of them dianiform, were observed on the scalp, face and trunk, where they tended to converge, on the arms and thighs, and more scattered on the forearms and legs. On the lateral aspect of both arms and on the flanks they form an erythematous oedematous plaque on which there are tense blisters with a clear content. On the palms there are millimetric erythematous papules. There were crusted erosions on the trunk and upper extremities, affecting less than 10% of the total body surface, as well as erosions on the soft palate with no involvement of the labial, ocular or genital mucosa. Nikolsky's sign is negative.

Complementary examinations
Blood tests showed elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 22 mg/dl, leukocytes 21200/ul, neutrophils 19500/ul, lymphocytes 993/ul, rest of white series normal). Punch biopsy of the upper third of the back revealed spongiform dermatitis with neutrophilic exocytosis, formation of intraepidermal pustules and intense neutrophilic subepithelial pseudo-ampullary neutrophilic oedema. Serology for hepatotropic viruses, HIV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and blood cultures were negative.

Diagnosis
Combined form of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Treatment
Methylprednisone iv 1 mg/kg/day is started.

Evolution
In the following days the de-epithelialised areas progressed minimally with negative Nikolsky, affecting less than 10% of the total body surface, with early re-epithelialisation. The skin improvement was rapid and progressive, with remission of fever and satisfactory clinical evolution, and she was discharged 10 days after admission, with a descending course of oral steroids.
