42-year-old male, with an alcoholic habit (6L beer/day) and a history of small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis diagnosed following an outbreak of palpable purpura in 2013. Due to the patient's refusal, an extension study was not performed despite proteinuria at diagnosis, having managed the following outbreaks by self-medicating with short courses of prednisone. In June 2018, he presented with a painless increase in left testicular volume and was assessed by Urology, diagnosed with acute orchitis and started on Ciprofloxacin. Ten days later, he went to his primary care physician for watery diarrhoea and fever of 38oC. Laboratory tests showed anaemia (Hb 7 g/dL) with a tendency to macrocytosis (MCV 99 fL) associated with alteration of the cytolytic liver profile and direct hyperbilirubinaemia (4.09mg/dL). After 6 days, she came to the emergency department reporting deterioration of general condition and dyspnoea on exertion, associated with a new outbreak of bilateral palpable pretibial purpura. Worsening of anaemia (Hb 5mg/dL) and slight elevation of LDH were observed, with normalisation of the liver profile and hyperbilirubinaemia. Urea in the normal range. The peripheral blood smear showed significant anisocytosis, hypochromia and <1 schistocyte per field. The patient was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia probably related to an outbreak of SchÃ¶nlein-Henoch's disease vs underlying polyarteritis nodosa.
On the hospital ward, the patient described episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting that he related to alcohol intake. He denied macroscopic bleeding. Physical examination revealed a large mass in the left flank, with a soft and painless consistency, not previously described. An abdominal ultrasound was requested, reporting significant distension of the left colon up to the sigma.
The Coombs test was expanded and was negative and haptoglobin was normal. Toxin C. Difficile toxin negative.
As the ultrasound description was not compatible with the exploratory findings, an abdominal CT scan was requested, which showed a large retroperitoneal collection (11.5x30 cm) related to bleeding from the splenic vein secondary to acute necrohaemorrhagic pancreatitis.
