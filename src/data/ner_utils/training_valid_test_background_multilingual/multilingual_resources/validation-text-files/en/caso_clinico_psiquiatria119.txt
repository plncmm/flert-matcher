At the age of 22 he was diagnosed with HIV infection and then unclassified depressive disorder. Acute pancreatitis at 23 and 25 years of age, followed by pulmonary tuberculosis. At the age of 26 pneumonia. At the age of 28 closed lumbar vertebral fracture. At the age of 29 he was diagnosed with hepatitis C virus liver disease. No seizures. No known drug allergies. Two self-harming attempts with benzodiazepines. She is the second of 3 siblings. The father worked as a commercial agent, travelling frequently, and the mother worked as a teacher. She studied in a religious school until the birth of her younger brother (10 years apart), at which point she went to public school where she finished her school-leaving certificate. At the age of 16, she began a relationship with a friend of her older brother, who at the age of 18, in a vis a vis situation, got her pregnant and transmitted the HIV infection to her, and she subsequently had an abortion. She is single, childless and has always lived with partners who have been drug users. Unemployed, she has had odd jobs in the hotel industry until she was granted a non-contributory pension in 2001. Her parents separated informally 15 years ago, leaving the 3 children in the father's care: "my mother abandoned us". Currently, she lives with her retired father. Medium-high economic level. No pending court cases. 

Family history
Father: ischaemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Older brother: polydrug addiction, died in 2007 by self-harm. Younger brother: chronic fatigue syndrome and anxiety. Paternal uncle died of alcoholic cirrhosis. 

Toxicological history
At the age of 13 she was initiated in the consumption of intoxicants (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis) by her older brother: "I have been an alcoholic since I was 15". At the age of 16 she started taking amphetamines and hallucinogens, which she self-supplied by selling them. At the age of 18, she started using heroin and cocaine snorted at weekends and soon moved on to daily use. At the age of 28, while intoxicated, he suffers an accidental fall from a first floor, causing a fractured lumbar spine, with no further consequences. He repeatedly tried to detoxify on his own, without success, until he sought professional help at the age of 29.

Use of the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Ferrando et al, 2000) corroborated polyaddiction to alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, opiates and cocaine. The use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID II) (Gómez-Beneyto et al., 1994) showed the following: Avoidant personality disorder and passive-aggressive personality disorder.

TREATMENT
Pharmacological
Initially stabilised with 90 mg of methadone. He has been on a Methadone Maintenance Programme (MMP) during the periods 2005-2009 and 2010-2012. In between, he underwent a programme with the opioid antagonist naltrexone 50 mg. Since starting treatment, he has been prescribed different antidepressants such as paroxetine 20-40 mg, citalopram 20 mg, mirtazapine 15-30 mg and trazodone 50 mg. Anxiolytics and hypnotics always at low doses: alprazolam 0.5-1 mg; bromazepam 4.5 mg, diazepam 5-20 mg, lormetazepam 2 mg and zolpidem 10 mg. Occasionally, treatment has been reinforced with an antiepileptic such as pregabalin 150-600 mg. Alcohol interdictors - disulfi ram and cyanamide - have been taken directly from other drug dependence resources. Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone 3 mg and olanzapine 5 mg have been poorly tolerated. He has only maintained tiapride 300 mg in repeated alcoholic outpatient detoxification, with clomethiazole and vitamin B complex. He is currently taking antiretrovirals: ritonavir 100 mg/day, saquinavir 600 mg/day; emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir 245 mg/day, in addition to the treatment prescribed in the ACU: escitalopram 20 mg/day and diazepam 10 mg/day.

Other resources and approaches used
Since she came into contact with our Unit, she has followed outpatient and inpatient residential treatment, managing to remain drug-free for more than 3 years after admission to a Therapeutic Community followed by Day Centres. He underwent several rounds of psychotherapy, group and individual, cognitive-behavioural, psycho-educational and relapse prevention. 
She has also recently completed a relaxation workshop.

EVOLUTION
For the patient, the aim of the treatment is to "normalise" her life and get away from "everything related to drugs". This means that she does not accept medication, which she considers "junkie", nor does she accept referral to the Mental Health Unit, as she finds it stigmatising. Her evolution has been irregular, alternating periods of stability with others of relapse, generally associated with alcohol and cannabis use, which she considers "normalised". Opiate and cocaine dependence remain in sustained total remission. Currently, she maintains good adherence to the unit, regularly attending appointments (medical and psychological) and those of Infectious Diseases, where she is on antiretroviral treatment. However, there is still a high degree of somatic and emotional discomfort related to family circumstances and intrusive memories of experiences from his past that he expresses with intense discomfort and cause him significant limitations in his social adjustment. Since February, when he left the PMM, he has suffered from generalised arthromyalgia, which has triggered his hypochondriasis and anxious anticipation. He continues to use cannabis and sporadically alcohol. He does not attend any other drug addiction resource.
