Our patient was a 62-year-old male with a personal history of bronchial asthma and a former smoker until 8 years ago with an accumulated burden of 36 pack-years. He lived in a farmhouse where he had dogs, cats and birds. He was being treated with budesonide/ formoterol and montelukast inhalers with no pharmacological allergies.
She came to the emergency department for a week of loss of strength in the left hemibody together with clumsiness of the left hand and altered gait, which worsened on the day of her visit to the emergency department; she also had a self-limited episode a month and a half ago of altered speech. Further anamnesis revealed that two months earlier she had presented with pleuritic pain on her left side, as well as cough with whitish expectoration, without associated fever or haemoptysis, and had not received any antibiotic treatment at home; these symptoms were not present at the time of admission. She also reported a weight loss of about 8 kg in the last month with no other digestive or urinary symptoms. He also reported no dental extractions.
On examination, blood pressure was 133/75 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats/min, temperature 36.3oC, basal oxygen saturation 98% and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. He was in good general condition, conscious, oriented and alert. On neurological examination, speech was coherent with no dysarthric or dysphasic features. With normal PINLA, MOEC and confrontational campimetry. There was no nuchal rigidity or meningeal signs, but there was a decrease in strength in the left hemibody, predominantly proximal, 3/5 in the left upper limb and 4/5 in the left lower limb. He had sensory extinction in the left limbs, with a non-ataxic gait. Examination of the oropharynx revealed the absence of several teeth and multiple cavities. Cardiorespiratory auscultation showed only some wheezing in both lung fields, with rhythmic heart tones and no audible murmurs. The abdominal examination was normal and the lower limbs showed only discrete perimalleolar oedema +/+++, with no skin lesions.

Additional tests performed in the emergency department included:
- A complete blood count showed a haemoglobin of 12 g/dL with 13,200 leukocytes/uL (80.2% neutrophils and 14.7% lymphocytes) and 391,000 platelets. On biochemistry, renal function and ions were within normal and coagulation was also normal, with only fibrinogen 644.7 mg/dl.
- A chest X-ray showed increased density in the left upper lobe with hilar retraction and loss of lung volume.
- The ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a frequency of 70 bpm, without repolarisation alterations.
- Finally, a cranial CT scan with and without intravenous contrast was also performed in the emergency department, showing a lesion at the right frontoparietal level with associated oedema and contrast uptake in a ring. Differential diagnosis In the differential diagnosis of ring contrast-enhancing brain lesions, the following causes should be taken into account: Neoplasms
- Primary or CNS (supratentorial): glioblastomas, astrocytomas, CNS lymphoma.
- Secondary: Metastases, especially in this patient the pulmonary origin should be taken into account, as he is a former smoker and the possibility of an underlying tumour mass causing the atelectasis on the chest X-ray. Other neoplasms to take into account would be melanoma, gastrointestinal cancer or renal carcinoma. Infections
- Brain abscess, due to contiguity or haematogenous dissemination (dental, endocarditis, pulmonary...).
- Toxoplasmosis (more frequent in immunocompromised patients).

Evolution
After the findings in the emergency department, with the established neurological symptoms and the lesion seen in the CT scan, it was decided to admit the patient to the neurosurgery department for study. The day after admission, MRI was performed to elucidate the origin of the cerebral LOE, which described "a rounded lesion measuring 2 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm located in the posterior areas of the right semioval centre, surrounded by extensive perilesional oedema and presenting an irregular wall with low signal in the T2 sequences, with a centre showing low signal in T1, intermediate in the FlairT2 sequence and high in the T2-weighted spin-echo sequence. The lesion shows diffusion restriction and a pattern of metabolites in the spectroscopic study in which the presence of a large peak of lactic acid and slight elevation of choline stand out. The perfusion study showed no findings suggestive of neoformative angiogenesis. After administration of IVC, there was intense enhancement of the IVC wall with clear delineation of certain irregularities in the wall. No other areas of intracranial pathological enhancement were observed. The findings described, except for the irregularities of the wall, suggest a probable brain abscess". Following these findings, the lesion was drained by stereotaxic puncture, the material was sent to microbiology for culture and empirical antibiotic treatment was started with Vancomycin at a dose of 1.5g every 12 hours iv. Metronidazole 500 mg every 12 hours iv. and cefotaxime 2gr/8 hours iv.
On the second day of his stay on the ward, the patient presented a fever peak of 38.2oC, so venous blood cultures were taken and the study was extended while awaiting the results of the drainage, requesting a general analysis with tumour markers, an echocardiogram and a thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan.
In the general analysis, the only notable findings were an ESR of 9 mm, with 17,700 leukocytes/uL, 90.2% PMN and CRP of 0.6 mg/dl. Tumour markers (CEA 1.2, AFP 1.7, Ca 125, Ca 72.4, Ca 19.9, NSE, PSA and S100) were normal. In the echocardiogram there were no signs of endocarditis and the thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT was reported as "lesion affecting the left upper lobe with an alveolar pattern and with the presence of areas of necrosis and communication with the bronchial tree inside. There is pleural involvement and an atelectasis component. Small lymphadenopathies were observed in the upper mediastinum, aorto-pulmonary window and right para-tracheal. At the abdominal level, no significant alterations were observed except for the existence of left inguinal herniation. Conclusion: the thoracic lesion must have an inflammatory/infectious aetiology and the possibility of tumour pathology cannot be radically ruled out".
After starting antibiotic treatment, the neurological symptoms improved with a control cranial MRI where the size of the abscess decreased and a small left supratentorial collection, which was present in the previous study and which had also shown a reduction in size, became evident. Microbiological results were received, growing in the brain abscess culture a Streptococcus intermedius sensitive to penicillin (MIC less than 0.064), cefotaxime (MIC less than 0.064), vancomycin (MIC 1), and sensitive to clindamycin, linezolid and daptomycin. Venous blood culture was negative. In addition, radiological control of the lung lesion was performed by chest CT scan, which showed almost complete resolution of the alveolar occupation described, with the presence of fibrotic or cicatricial atelectasis of the left upper lobe with bronchiectasis inside.

Final diagnosis
Cerebral abscesses due to Streptococcus intermedius secondary to cavitary pneumonia.
