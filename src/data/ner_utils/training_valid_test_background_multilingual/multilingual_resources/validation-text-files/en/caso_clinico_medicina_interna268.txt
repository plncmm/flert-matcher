A 16-year-old male, a refugee from Afghanistan living in Spain for 6 months in a residence with children and other immigrants, with a normal medical examination, negative mantoux test, with no other history of interest, who presented with a cough with whitish-yellowish expectoration, occasional vomiting of food and fever of up to 38.5oC with generalised convulsions of 6 days' duration, treated with NSAIDs and paracetamol. She had no other digestive or urinary symptoms and no history of dental extractions.
Examination was unremarkable, in good general condition, maintaining constant values. Laboratory tests: Hb 14.1 mg/dl, leukocytes 20,070 with left deviation, LDH 403 U/L, CRP 33.6 mg/dl with normal haemogram, coagulation and biochemistry.
Chest X-ray: increased density in LSI with suspected cavitation. The rest was normal.
Given the following findings, a differential diagnosis of pulmonary cavitated lesion should be made. Among the causes to be assessed, the first possibility is infectious origin, to be taken into account due to the epidemiological context, not only anaerobic bacteria but also tuberculosis, so cultures are collected and sputum smear microscopy is performed. Given the different diagnostic approaches, it is important to bear in mind that our patient is immunocompetent and HIV negative.

Evolution
A thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed a hydatid cyst in a ruptured and infected LSI. Two hydatid cysts in the liver.
Echonococcosis serology was positive, and the patient was sent to the thoracic surgery department for a left upper lobectomy, presenting post-operatively with atelectasis of the left lung requiring therapeutic bronchoscopy and air leakage treated with a Heimlich valve.
