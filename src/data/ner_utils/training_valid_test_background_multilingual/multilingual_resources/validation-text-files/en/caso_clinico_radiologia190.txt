A 68-year-old man, type II diabetic and cirrhotic due to HCV, was admitted for scheduled surgery for adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder. The immediate postoperative period was complicated by bacterial peritonitis secondary to infection of the surgical wound and acute renal failure, with progressive clinical improvement. Two weeks later there was a clinical worsening with signs of septic shock. A portable abdominal X-ray was performed in which a linear radiolucent image was identified in the right hypochondrium, suggestive of intramural gas in the gallbladder wall. The study was extended with an abdominopelvic CT scan to rule out perforation and intra-abdominal collections. The images showed a distended gallbladder with intraluminal gas in the fundus and abundant intramural gas with extension of the bubbles to adjacent fatty tissues, showing a solution of continuity in the medial infundibular region, associated with marked trabeculation of the perivesicular fat and free fluid. The findings are compatible with perforated emphysematous cholecystitis.
