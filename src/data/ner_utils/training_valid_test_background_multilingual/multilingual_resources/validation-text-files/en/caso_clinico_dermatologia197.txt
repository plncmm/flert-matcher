Anamnesis
A 7-month-old boy, born at term by instrumental vacuum delivery, with no other personal history of interest. From the second day of life, he presented whitish ring-shaped lesions on the scalp that had increased in size and number since their appearance. Due to the probable congenital nature of the dermatosis, the anamnesis was completed by asking the mother about her personal history of genital lesions. The mother reported the presence of genital and inguinal lesions since 2 years before conception for which she had been treated with imiquimod and trichloracetic acid prescribed by her primary care physician. Both the patient and the mother had no history of immunosuppression.

Physical examination
Examination revealed multiple whitish papules with an umbilicated centre, following an annular distribution of considerable diameter. The maternal physical examination revealed lesions with the same characteristics as those of her son, covering the inner aspect of both thighs.

Additional tests
Various complementary tests were performed, including serology for STI screening of the mother, which were negative, in addition to curettage of one of the infant's lesions and another of the mother's lesions for histopathological confirmation. The findings were compatible with molluscum contagiosum in both cases.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis was compatible with vertically transmitted molluscum contagiosum.

Treatment
In agreement with the mother, curettage of all lesions was performed on both the mother and the infant.

Evolution
More than 3 months after treatment, both the patient and his mother have had no further lesions suggestive of molluscum contagiosum.
