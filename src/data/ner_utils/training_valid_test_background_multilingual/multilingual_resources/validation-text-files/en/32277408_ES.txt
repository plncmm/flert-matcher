A 63-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of expectoration with sticky white sputum, fever of 39.3°C, exertional dyspnoea and chest tightness. He had no history of heart disease or hypertension. He had had an allergic cough for 5 years and a history of smoking. He had recently travelled to Hubei Province (China).
Arterial blood gases on admission showed a pH of 7.049, PCO2 of 76.4 mmHG, PO2 of 66.2 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 91.8%. Nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum were tested for the usual respiratory viruses, all of which were negative. In addition, blood samples showed increased alanine aminotransferase (97 U/L) and creatinine (157 μmol/L), together with haematuria, indicating impaired hepatic and renal capacity. Bedside radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. On the first day of admission, COVID-19 was genetically confirmed from sputum tests. 
Markers of myocardial injury were high troponin I (11.35 g/L), myoglobin (390.97ng/mL) and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (22,600 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia without ST-segment elevation. A bedside echocardiogram showed left ventricular dilatation (61 mm), diffuse myocardial dyskinesia with a low LV ejection fraction (32%) and pulmonary hypertension (44 mmHg), without decreased right heart activity. No pericardial effusion was observed.
The diagnosis was established as severe pneumonia, ARDS, fulminant myocarditis and multi-organ failure. Treatment was assisted ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral therapy, interferon α-1b, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, piperacillin/tazobactam and renal replacement therapy. Eleven days after admission, the lung lesions continued to progress and the ventilator was unable to maintain oxygen saturation. The interventricular septum thickened to 14 mm and interleukin 6 (IL-6) increased to 272.40pg/mL. Accordingly, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was applied to reduce the lung burden. The ECMO rotation speed was 3500 rpm, blood flow rate 4.30 L/min, air flow rate 4.00 L/min and FiO2 100%. The patient's condition improved. Analyses three days later showed that troponin I was reduced to 0.10g/L, PNCNT was 750pg/mL and interleukin 6 was 7.63pg/mL. After treatment, LV ejection fraction gradually recovered to 68%, LV and septal thickness returned to normal values and bedside radiography indicated that lesions had decreased. However, infection markers gradually increased from day 26 and vasoactives were needed to maintain blood pressure. On day 29, Candida, human α-herpesvirus and β-herpesvirus were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage; blood cultures were positive for Bacteroides ovalus, indicating worsening superinfection. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure and tricuspid annulus plane systolic displacement showed sudden decreases on days 26 and 29, suggesting deterioration of right heart activity. After a round of consultations with the expert group, anti-infective treatment was reinforced, but the effect was not positive. Gradually, septic shock and generalised intravascular coagulation and cutaneous ecchymosis developed. The patient died on the 33rd day of hospitalisation.
