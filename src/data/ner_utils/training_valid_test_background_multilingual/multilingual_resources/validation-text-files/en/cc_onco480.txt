Anamnesis
Male, 47 years old, Caucasian, nuclear power plant risk technician by profession, married, lives with his wife, and is independent for basic activities of daily living.
He has smoked half a pack of blond tobacco (10 cigarettes) from the age of 16 until the time of diagnosis (47 years), with a pack-year index (PPI) of approximately 15. He is chronically deaf in his right ear and has undergone tonsillectomy and appendectomy. He has no known allergies and does not take any pharmacological treatment. No family history of interest.
The patient debuted in December 2011 with cough and dyspnoea, with initial suspicion of respiratory infection, for which reason he started antibiotic treatment.

Physical examination
In the absence of improvement, the patient attended the emergency department in February 2012. He presented good general condition, Eastern Cooperative Group Oncology (ECOG) scale 1, normal physical constants and right basal hypoventilation on examination, with no other findings of interest.

Complementary tests
The chest X-ray performed in the emergency department showed right pleural effusion, and the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for further investigation. Thoracentesis and pleural biopsies showed morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) data compatible with adenocarcinoma, with positive thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), positive cytokeratin (CK) 7 and negative CK 5 and 6. At the molecular level, no mutations were found in EGFR exons 18, 19, 20 and 21. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a nodular pleura solidly occupying the angle of the right costophrenic sinus, bilateral pulmonary nodules and the known right pleural effusion. In addition, video bronchoscopy with biopsy was performed to complete the molecular study, without finding ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).

Diagnosis
With the diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (TxNxM1a), without EGFR mutations and ALK non-rearranged, the patient was referred to the Medical Oncology Outpatient Clinic.

Treatment
In March 2012, he started first line chemotherapy treatment with carboplatin AUC-5 and pemetrexed 500 mg every 21 days, adding bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg from the second cycle onwards, not starting previously due to dehiscence of stitches from the previous video bronchoscopy. She completed four cycles in May, with good clinical tolerance and partial response to the disease. Subsequently, in June, she started maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and bevacizumab.

Evolution
In July 2014, the patient visited the clinic, reporting poorer tolerance to treatment, with more prolonged side effects, such as asthenia, headache and joint pain. For this reason, after 36 cycles (with a progression-free interval [PFSI] of 27 months from the start of chemotherapy and 24 months from the start of maintenance), pemetrexed was discontinued and treatment was continued with bevacizumab. In December 2014, in the absence of significant radiological disease and after assessing the risks and benefits, bevacizumab was discontinued and follow-up was performed (PIL since the start of chemotherapy of 32 months, PIL since the start of maintenance of 29 months and PIL since the start of bevacizumab monotherapy of 5 months).
Given the atypical evolution of the patient, the molecular study continued during this time, on previous pleural biopsy, without finding mutations in BRAF, KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61) or MET.
61) and MET, with ROS-1 not being assessable due to the absence of hybridisation signals.
During follow-up, in the CT scan of April 2015, a lesion appeared at the base of the right hemithorax with liquid content that was not visible in the previous study, and thoracentesis was performed with only 1-2 ml of clear liquid and insufficient cellularity for diagnosis, so an attempt was made to perform a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration puncture (FNA), which was impossible due to the location of the lesion. For these reasons, given the scant evidence of disease, it was decided to continue follow-up, until, in a new CT scan in August 2015, a solid pulmonary nodule appeared in the right lower lobe, 9 mm in diameter, and the pleural lesion in the right posterior costophrenic sinus was found to be stable.
Given these results, with high suspicion of progression, a PET-CT scan was requested, which also revealed uptake in the mediastinal and right posterior basal right pleura.
After a PIL of 41 months and a treatment-free interval (TFI) of 8 months, it was decided, given the good previous response and the platinum-free interval, to re-treat with the same scheme (carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab), which began in October 2015, completing the 4 cycles in December, with excellent tolerance and achieving a complete response in CT. She continued with subsequent maintenance with pemetrexed and bevacizumab, which started in January 2016. Given the availability of the technique, in October 2016, massive sequencing of the disease was performed on the histological sample available at diagnosis, which showed evidence of EZR-ROS-1 fusion.
Given the good clinical tolerance and response achieved, it was decided to continue with maintenance, with withdrawal of pemetrexed in December 2016 and bevacizumab in March 2018, at which time the CT scan showed no evidence of tumour disease, so therapeutic rest was decided.
On re-evaluation in May 2018, a 12 mm subpleural nodule suspicious of malignancy appeared. After an ILP of 31 months and an ILT of 2 months, given the progression, the patient was offered the start of treatment in a clinical trial with entrectinib 600 mg every 24 hours, with excellent tolerance and response.
After a cumulative survival of 86 months (approximately 7 years), the patient continues on treatment with excellent quality of life.
