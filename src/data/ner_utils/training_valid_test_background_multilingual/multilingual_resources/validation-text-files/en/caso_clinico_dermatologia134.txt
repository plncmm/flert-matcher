Anamnesis
A 49-year-old female patient, allergic to exenatide and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic, was referred from primary care for a single lesion on the left leg of 4 months' evolution, asymptomatic and progressively growing. She had a pet dog, properly checked at the veterinary clinic, with no pathology. She had not travelled abroad recently.

Physical examination
On the lateral aspect of the left leg there was an erythematous and indurated plaque of 15 x 15 mm, slightly scaly and with a dark central crust adherent with scarce serous exudate.

Additional examinations
With the suspicion of Oriental Button, the following complementary tests were performed:
- Skin biopsy: Skin fragment with necrotising granulomatous reaction secondary to Leishmania infection, with identification of amastigotes in tissue macrophages by Giemsa technique.
- Blood count and general biochemistry without alterations.
- Negative serology for viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus and Treponema palli-dum.
- Indirect immunofluorescence for leishmania negative.

Diagnosis
Acute cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Treatment
Treatment with the antimonial drug meglumine antimoniate was carried out by intralesional injection of 0.5 ml fortnightly until 5 infiltrations were completed.

Evolution
From the first intralesional dose, the lesion improved markedly until it remained as a residual brownish plaque of 15 mm, with a whitish atrophic centre, without induration or desquamation.
