Anamnesis
A 39-year-old woman, with no known drug allergies or medical history of interest. Contraceptive patch as the only treatment.
She came to the hospital with a clinical picture of sudden onset of a sensation of right hemilipedal cramping and dysphagia, accompanied by tingling in the ala of the right nose and in the first two fingers of the right hand. There was no associated loss of strength, or alteration of language or vision. She reported no accompanying headache. A week earlier he had undergone cervical stretching manoeuvres for a "cervical contracture".

Physical examination
Neurological examination: conscious and oriented in the three spheres. Language: fluent, understands, names and repeats. Mild dysarthria. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Normal external eye movements. No campimetric alterations. No diplopia. Right supranuclear facial palsy and right facial hypoaesthesia. Hypophonia. Paralysis of the right XII cranial nerve. No motor or sensory alterations. Normal osteotendinous reflexes with RCPFB. No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia. Romberg negative with normal gait. NIHSS = 2. Violaceous erythematous lesions on the hands and feet with a marbled appearance, which looked like livedo reticularis. The rest of the general examination was normal.

Complementary tests
- Blood pressure 160/98 mmHg; heart rate 108 bpm; O2 saturation 99%. Afebrile.
- Laboratory tests: complete blood count, biochemistry, thyroid hormones, homocysteine, normal lipid and renal pattern.
- Serology: hepatitis B and Brucella negative. Borrelia: initially positive (IgG + IgM) but not subsequently confirmed in cerebrospinal fluid or serum.
- Immunological study: anticardiolipin, anti-nuclear, anti-DNA, ANCA, cryoglobulin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies: negative.
- Thrombophilia study: negative.
- Biochemistry and immunoelectrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid: normal. Cerebrospinal fluid serology: negative.
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm without repolarisation alterations.
- Cranial computed tomography: cortical hypodense lesion assessable in a single slice in the right temporo-parietal region without significant mass effect and with a slight enlargement of a nearby sulcus. A deep hypodense lacunar lacunar lesion was also identified in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Marked enlargement with a parietal sulcus on the left side with a small area of cortical hypodensity in the depth of the sulcus. Summary: Ischaemic lesions of old-evolved appearance in the left parietal lobe, right temporo-occipital region and left-sided cerebellar hemisphere. These were small vessel and multi-territory ischaemic events. In addition, diffuse cerebral retraction was identified, which was greater than expected for the patient's age group.
- Neurosonological study: supra-aortic trunks duplex: patent carotid shafts, intimal thickening in the right common carotid artery. No atheromatous plaques were observed. Patent vertebrae with left dominance. Transcranial duplex: middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery patent and symmetrical. Posterior fossa: basilar normal, permeable vertebrae, left dominance.
- Bubble test: negative at rest and with Valsalva manoeuvres.
- Cervical CT angiography and cerebral arterial polygon: no significant carotid or vertebral atherosclerotic lesions were identified. In the anterior circulation, no alterations of the anterior cerebral arteries were identified, with left-sided dominance as an anatomical variant of normality and no alterations of the middle cerebral arteries in the M1-M2 segments. In the circulation, no alterations of both PICA, AICA, superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries were observed, with apparent millimetric patency of the posterior communicating arteries.
- Cranial MRI: in the supratentorial compartment there was an area of hyperintensity in T2 and FLAIR sequences involving the cerebral cortex in the left-sided rolandic sulcus, immediately caudal to the theoretical location of the hand motor area according to the Penfield homunculus. This area showed marked hyperintensity in the diffusion image with decreased apparent diffusion coefficients. There were other areas of peripheral hyperintensity on FLAIR sequences, none of which showed diffusion restriction, one of which was located deep in the left-sided parietal gyrus, with marked enlargement of the gyrus, indicating a scar retraction component. There was also a subtle hyperintensity affecting one of the temporal gyri, but without associated volume loss and with extension of the alterations into the adjacent white matter. In addition, in the posterior fossa, a focus of millimetric hyperintensity was visualised in the cerebellar hemisphere on the left side, also with no apparent decrease in diffusion coefficients. Conclusion: acute ischaemic lesion affecting part of the left-sided primary motor area. Other lesions were identified, one of them of chronic aspect and another one evolved, located in the cerebral cortex of the left parietal and right temporal lobes, respectively. Old lacunar infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
- Angioresonance imaging of the polygon of Willis: no alterations of particular pathological significance were observed in the polygon of Willis. The cervical study did not identify mural haematomas in the cervical segments of both vertebral arteries.
- Arteriography of supra-aortic trunks and HF: alteration of the distal branches of the cerebral arteries suggestive of vasculitis of the medium/small calibre arteries.
- Echocardiogram (ECG): no alterations.
- Holter ECG: no cardiac rhythm alterations were identified.
- A skin biopsy from the right knee was performed: histologically non-specific perivascular inflammatory process of mild superficial dermal intensity. There was no evidence of vasculitis or vascular occlusion.

Evolution
No new episodes of deficiency have occurred.

Diagnosis
- Ischaemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery of infrequent cause.
- Evolved territorial infarcts (left parietal and right temporal), clinically silent.
- Cerebral vasculopathy, with involvement of small and medium calibre.
- Livedo reticularis.
- Suspicion of Sneddon's syndrome.
