A 58-year-old man with no past history of interest who two months before admission had been diagnosed with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) type I with positive anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. He presented with fever of non-infectious origin and acute renal failure. He received induction treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis, and continued maintenance treatment with prednisone (60 mg daily) and prophylactic co-trimoxazole (160/800 mg every other day). Despite this, renal function had not improved and he was on a regular haemodialysis programme through a tunnelled right jugular central venous catheter (CVC).
He was admitted to the Nephrology Department due to intermittent fever of up to 39oC of about three weeks' duration, for which he had been treated with cefazolin without improvement. In the three days prior to admission, he presented with diarrhoea without pathological products, with colicky abdominal pain and nausea. On examination he was in good general condition despite fever and was normohydrated and normotensive. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal, the abdomen was soft, with no signs of peritoneal irritation and the CVC showed no signs of infection of the orifice or the tunnel. There were no skin lesions, lymphadenopathies or neurological focality.
Urgent laboratory tests were requested, highlighting normochromic normochromic anaemia (10.7 g/dl haemoglobin), leukopenia (2,420 leukocytes/μl) with a predominance of neutrophils (84%), and thrombopenia (89,000 platelets/μl). There was an increase in acute phase reactants with C-reactive protein (CRP) of 85.1 mg/l. Ferritin was 235 ng/ml and transaminases, bilirubin and pancreatic enzymes were normal. Blood cultures taken from the peripheral vein and CVC were negative, as was the stool culture, and the stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin. Treatment with metronidazole was started, with clinical improvement and disappearance of the diarrhoea. Despite this, fever persisted and haematological alterations were accentuated, with a decrease in the values of the three series: 770 leukocytes/μL with 450 neutrophils/μL, 69,000 platelets/μL and haemoglobin of 9.5 mg/dL. Plasma polymerase chain reaction testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6, 7 and 8, and Epstein-Barr virus was requested, as well as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound. The CMV viral load was positive, detecting 9.39x106 IU/mL, with negativity for the rest of the viruses analysed, so treatment was started with intravenous ganciclovir at a dose adjusted to renal function. Endoscopy revealed gastric and duodenal ulcers, from which samples were taken for pathological anatomy and CMV polymerase chain reaction, the result of the latter being positive (754,000 IU/ml).
At this time the patient met the criteria for haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), given that he presented fever, cytopenias, elevated ferritin (had risen to 8,006 ng/ml), elevated triglycerides (332 mg/dL), low fibrinogen (121 mg/dL), splenomegaly and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor (3,079 U/ml). Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were performed, with no evidence of neoplasia or haemophagocytosis in the biopsy, although there were few signs of haemophagocytosis in the aspirate smears, and a culture for mycobacteria of this sample was pending, as well as a peripheral vein blood culture for mycobacteria.
The SHF was considered secondary to CMV infection and, after 14 days of treatment with ganciclovir, the fever disappeared with improvement in the patient's general condition, although the cytopenias persisted: 400 leucocytes/μl with only 60 neutrophils/μl, 46,000 platelets/μl and haemoglobin of 10 g/dl. Given the severe neutropenia, it was decided to suspend ganciclovir, add colony-stimulating factor and immunoglobulin treatment, using a mixed approach of ganciclovir toxicity and SHF, with improvement in the platelet count and excellent response in the leukocyte count: 5,220 leukocytes/μl with 4,000 neutrophils/μl, 65,000 platelets/μl and 9 g/dl haemoglobin. After this, the fever reappeared, this time with associated respiratory symptoms (cough without expectoration), and a chest X-ray showed a nodular image in the right upper lobe (RUL) that had not existed previously, so a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was requested. The CT scan showed a solid pulmonary nodule measuring 21 x 16.7 mm in the anterior segment of the LSD, with irregular borders, as well as scattered micronodules, some clustered in a "budding tree'' pattern.

Differential diagnosis
For the differential diagnosis, we discuss below those pathologies that involve pulmonary nodules, especially those that may present with an associated "budding tree" pattern1-3. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or metastases may present with this pattern, although the rapid onset and infectious symptoms make this diagnosis unlikely. We could also think of pulmonary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which may manifest with pulmonary nodules and present with fever, but again, the appearance and growth of the nodules in a short time suggests inflammatory or infectious aetiologies. Some autoimmune diseases may present with this pattern, such as sarcoidosis, drug hypersensitivity pneumonitis (the 2 cm pulmonary nodule does not support this diagnosis), pneumoconiosis (the patient had no history of exposure to the causative agents) or vasculitis such as Churg-Strauss disease and Wegener's granulomatosis (these were ruled out in the diagnostic study of his RPGN and, moreover, there are no other symptoms to support them). The fact that our patient was on immunosuppressive treatment for his underlying nephropathy argues against an autoimmune origin.
Various bacterial infections by microorganisms such as Legionella, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia psittaci or Mycoplasma can cause this type of infiltrate and fever. However, these are usually the cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and not to be expected after prolonged hospitalisation. Again, the presence of a well-defined nodule would argue against these aetiologies.
The patient's baseline clinical situation (immunosuppression by corticosteroids) and CMV infection (immunosuppressive infectious agent) predisposed him to superinfections by other viruses, parasites, fungi or slow-growing bacteria. We could have thought that CMV was also affecting the lung, as it can cause pulmonary nodules and the patient had had a high viremia with intestinal involvement, but the improvement after treatment with ganciclovir made this highly unlikely. An opportunistic fungal infection seemed a more than reasonable option. Histoplasma, Blastomyces and Coccidiodes were ruled out as they were not endemic in Spain. Aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Cryptococcus are more common in our environment and cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients that usually present subacutely, as in the case of our patient. In favour of an Aspergillus infection was the fact that the patient was immunosuppressed by corticosteroids, neutropenia and previous CMV infection, although the lack of cavitation of the detected nodule could not rule out an aetiology due to this fungus. Although nodular forms have been described in P. jirovecii infection, prophylactic treatment with co-trimoxazole and the absence of interstitial infiltrates argue against this diagnosis. Cryptococcus may present with pulmonary nodules, although central nervous system involvement in the form of meningitis is common in immunocompromised patients.
Nocardia is also a micro-organism to be considered in the immunocompromised patient. Prolonged fever, treatment with glucocorticoids and neutropenia are all in favour of its diagnosis. However, the most common form of presentation is cavitated nodules and, in addition, the patient had taken cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, which is usually effective against this bacterium. Tuberculosis deserves special mention as it can present in multiple forms and should be considered in almost any differential diagnosis. Pulmonary nodules and the "tree-sprout" pattern can coexist in this entity, which would have become evident after the immunosuppression suffered by the patient.

Evolution
A fibrobronchoscopy was performed in which samples were taken for bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, direct immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii, galactomannan determination and smear microscopy, all of which were negative except for the mycobacterial culture, which remained pending. We therefore decided to request a fine needle puncture and aspiration (FNA) and a CT-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) of the pulmonary nodule. While awaiting the results, the patient worsened due to the appearance of dyspnoea on minimal exertion. Laboratory tests again showed severe neutropenia (40 neutrophils/μl) with 66,000/μl platelets and haemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, and the appearance of dissociated cholostasis with normal bilirubin and elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (918 IU/l and 476 IU/l, respectively). A new chest CT scan showed the persistence of the nodule in LSD with no change in size and an increase in the number of millimetric nodules, with a change in the radiological pattern to a miliary pattern with extensive involvement of all lung segments. We are now receiving the results of the pending microbiological tests. Blood culture for mycobacteria and cultures for mycobacteria from lung nodule FNA and bone marrow aspirate were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was managed by lowering the steroid dose to 20 mg/day and initiating treatment with tuberculostatics (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol).
Suddenly, the patient suffered a picture of melaenic stools with haemodynamic repercussions, for which urgent endoscopy was performed, detecting a perforated bleeding ulcer at the level of the second duodenal portion, for which urgent surgery was performed, despite which it was not possible to control the hypovolemic shock situation, leading to exitus.

Final diagnosis
Cytomegalovirus disease in an immunocompromised patient, with high viraemia, gastroduodenal ulcers and secondary haemophagocytic syndrome.
Disseminated tuberculosis with bacteraemia, pulmonary, bone marrow and probably liver involvement (dissociated cholostasis).
Hypovolemic shock secondary to perforation of duodenal ulcer.
