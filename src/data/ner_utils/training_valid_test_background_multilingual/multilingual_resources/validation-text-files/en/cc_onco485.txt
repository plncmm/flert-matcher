Anamnesis
A 55-year-old man with a personal history of active smoking (pack-year index: 52), multinodular goitre and fracture of the proximal radius. His mother died of breast cancer at the age of 67 and his maternal uncle died of leukaemia at the age of 50. He does not take any treatment on a regular basis.
The patient started in early 2016 with increased non-productive cough with bilateral rib pain with pleuritic features, associated with dyspnoea on moderate exertion. Asthenia and weight loss of about 12 kg. He went to the emergency department for this reason, and a chest X-ray showed a large mass in the LSD, so he was referred to Internal Medicine.

Physical examination
The patient presented with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 1. No relevant findings during the physical examination.

Complementary tests
CT scan of the chest and abdomen: large mass (75 x 70 mm) located in the apical segment of the LSD, with a large central necrotic component. The tumour is in close contact with the mediastinal pleura. Multiple adenopathies of significant size in the right hilum and mediastinum: right paratracheal region (adenopathic conglomerate of 35 mm short axis), subcarinal region, right paraesophageal region and aortopulmonary window.
Echobronchoscopy: under ultrasound control, subcarinal and right paratracheal adenopathies were located. Samples were taken for pathological anatomy, obtaining material in the right paratracheal adenopathy corresponding to metastasis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, EGFR negative and ALK not translocated.
PET-CT scan: mass in LSD measuring approximately 8.2 x 7.7 x 8.0cm (AP, L, CC) with SUVmax 26.8. Right high and low right paratracheal mediastinal adenopathies of pathological size and uptake. Right hilar uptake SUVmax 4.9 suspicious for malignancy.

Diagnosis
LSD lung adenocarcinoma cT4 pN2 cM0, stage IIIB, EGFR not mutated, ALK not translocated.

Treatment
On 2 April 2016 he started chemotherapy treatment with neoadjuvant intent according to the following schedule: cisplatin (day 1): vinorelbine (days 1 and 8).

Evolution
After the second cycle of treatment, she required a change to carboplatin-vinorelbine due to poor tolerance, although her general condition deteriorated. It was decided to discontinue neoadjuvant treatment and the patient was presented to the Tumour Committee, where surgical treatment was rejected (due to functional deterioration) and it was decided to complete radical treatment with radiotherapy. In the PET re-evaluation prior to the start of radiotherapy, progression was observed at the level of the lung mass. Radiotherapy treatment was carried out from 23/08/2016 to 14/10/2016 with irradiation of the LSD tumour mass and affected lymph node areas until a total dose of 66 Gy was reached. A re-evaluation CT scan in December 2016 showed a partial response, and bilateral pulmonary and mediastinal progression was again observed in April 2017. Treatment was started with immunotherapy (anti-PD-1), with the first cycle being administered on 27/06/2017.
On 6/7/2017 he was admitted to the Medical Oncology Department for G3 diarrhoea (8 stools per day), with negative microbiological isolations. First antibiotherapy was started, without clinical improvement, so corticotherapy was started on suspicion of toxicity secondary to immunotherapy, with progressive clinical improvement. One week later, the patient was discharged from the clinic, with a descending course of corticoids.
Treatment was restarted and a second cycle was administered on 31/8/2017. He was admitted again for diarrhoea on 15/9/2017, initially due to a possible case of colitis in relation to immunotherapy treatment, intravenous corticotherapy and an absolute diet were started, and diagnostic tests were requested to rule out concomitant processes with detection of Clostridium difficile in stool, and antibiotherapy treatment was started. The patient's initial evolution was good, and oral tolerance was resumed and corticotherapy was suspended. However, the patient's condition worsened later on, and a role of pharmacological toxicity in addition to the infectious condition was not completely ruled out. Corticotherapy was reintroduced and antibiotic treatment was modified with subsequent progressive improvement.
The patient was discharged, but continued with grade 2 diarrhoea, requiring a more prolonged decrease in corticotherapy, and cycle 3 was not administered on 24/10/2017 for this reason. From the oncological point of view, the patient was re-evaluated and a response to the disease and bilateral, predominantly right-sided, inflammatory ground-glass opacities suggesting pneumonitis were observed. These images had no clinical correlation, and the patient was asymptomatic from the respiratory point of view. Treatment was suspended due to digestive toxicity, and the patient presented several exacerbations with a decrease in the dose of corticosteroids.
In January 2018, in the context of a decrease in the dose of corticosteroids, a CT scan showed a discrete increase in consolidated images in LSD of an indeterminate nature, and the possibility of progression could not be ruled out. Bronchoscopy was performed and the examination was normal, and the pathological anatomy of bronchial biopsies showed non-specific chronic fibrosing and inflammatory changes, with no evidence of malignancy. A prolonged descending regimen was again performed, until June 2018, when hydroaltesone was substituted.
She continued without treatment, with close follow-up every 2 months, maintaining response, with no evidence of measurable disease in the last CT scan in May 2019.
