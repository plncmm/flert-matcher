Reason for consultation
Visual hallucinations with preserved judgement of reality. The clinical case is developed in Primary Care and later in Hospital Accident and Emergency Departments, to complete the study.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests).
Personal history: no drug allergies, hypertension, non-smoker or drinker, permanent atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease, moderate aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF, chronic iron deficiency anaemia with normal endoscopic studies, acute biliary pancreatitis in 2015 of moderate severity, hypothyroidism. Cataract surgery on the left eye in 2017.

Baseline situation: independent for basic activities of daily living, higher functions preserved. He wanders alone. Lives with his wife.
Usual treatment: Sintrom 4 mg 1 tablet per day, eutirox 150 mg, furosemide 40 mg every 12 h, omeprazole 20 mg every 24 h, amlodipine 5 mg 1 tablet per day.

87-year-old patient who consulted the Health Centre, reporting visual hallucinations for 2 weeks (small zoonoses: worms, ants, chickens...) with impaired judgement, causing him anxiety. Afebrile. No consumption of new drugs or toxic substances. No data suggestive of infectious symptoms. No dyspnoea, no chest pain. No previous stressful situations. Accompanied by his wife, who reports that he has not behaved in unusual ways in recent weeks, not affecting his quality of life in any marked way, being able to carry out his usual activities. No cognitive deterioration.

Examination: haemodynamic stability: BP 130/80, HR 65 bpm, afebrile. Conscious, oriented in time and space and cooperative, with preserved judgement of reality, criticising the visual hallucinations. Eupneic at rest with no respiratory work. No findings of interest in cardiac auscultation or abdominal examination. No oedema in the lower limbs. Neurological examination was normal: isochoric pupils reactive to light, preserved external eye movements, normal confrontational campimetry (although hallucinations persisted at all times, which ceased when the eyes were closed). No ataxia or tremor. Preserved gait. Romberg negative. No neurological focality.
Mini Mental Test with no signs of cognitive deterioration, and negative toxicity test.
It was decided to refer to the emergency department of the reference hospital as it was the first episode of visual hallucinations in an independent patient, with no previous cognitive impairment. To rule out organicity.

Complementary tests
Blood tests: leucocytes 6,110, haemoglobin 8.5 (chronic anaemia already studied with similar values in previous tests), platelets 237,000. INR 2.3. Glucose 103, urea 51, creatinine 2 (previous controls similar 2.3), normal ions, no elevation of acute phase reactants. Vitamin B12 and thyroid normal, in the analysis of a week ago.
Urine normal. Chest and abdominal X-ray normal. Cranial CT scan: no acute findings of interest Assessment by Ophthalmology: visual acuity 0.3/ 0.1, right cataract. Left psuedophacoemulsification for left cataract surgery, with opacification of the posterior capsule. Bilateral dry AMD.
Assessment by Neurology and Psychiatry, ruling out pathology at these levels.

Clinical judgement (list of problems, differential diagnosis)
Clinical judgement: Charles Bonnet syndrome in a patient with poor bilateral visual acuity due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Differential diagnosis: psychiatric pathology (schizophrenia, delirious disorder...), neurological (Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, Parkinson's, delirium...), toxins, newly introduced drugs in the patient, endocrine-metabolic pathology (thyroid crisis), primary brain tumour, encephalitis, meningitis, brain metastasis of tumour of unknown origin...

Action plan and evolution
It was decided to intervene on the cataract in the right eye, and to make an appointment to apply YAG laser to the left eye, due to the opacification after cataract surgery in this eye. This would improve the patient's poor visual acuity, and the visual hallucinations could partially disappear.
Otherwise, there is no treatment of choice for Charles Bonnet syndrome. Anticomuic drugs, neuroleptics, antidepressants and cholinergic agents have been used to treat Charles Bonnet syndrome. However, there is currently insufficient clinical evidence to select a particular pharmacological treatment. This, together with hygienic measures (adequate lighting, being accompanied, etc.) improves the symptoms.

Evolution: in our patient's case, low doses of risperidone were used with acceptable results. This, together with the ocular intervention, reduced the frequency of hallucinations, improving the patient's distress and quality of life.
