A 64-year-old man presented with syncope, with no relevant past history. His vital signs were within normal ranges. Ear temperature was 38°C and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Chest X-ray revealed mild linear densities in the left middle and lower lung fields. Laboratory tests showed an increased white blood cell count (10,900 per ?L), high serum lactate concentration (250 (U/L) and high C-reactive protein values (89 mg/dL). All other blood tests were normal. COVID-19 was detected in a pharyngeal swab sample by RT-PCR. Due to worsening of the laboratory tests on day 2 (white blood cell count 15,270 per ?L; serum lactate 341 U/L, serum C-reactive protein 285 mg/dL), the patient was admitted to a specialised ward. On day 6, the patient presented with dyspnoea, decreased oxygen saturation and a further increase in C-reactive protein (336 mg/dL); white blood cell count was 10,800 per ?L and interleukin 6 was 80 ng/L (normal value < 6 ng/dL). On day 7, a non-contrast chest CT scan showed bilateral alveolar opacities, including ground-glass opacities and consolidation, with a prevalent posterior distribution, linear, mostly peripheral opacities, mild bilateral pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Assisted ventilation was started. The patient received two doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg), at 12-hour intervals, on days 7 and 8. On day 9, the C-reactive protein decreased to 96 mg/dL and the white blood cell count to 2,360 per µL. The patient's clinical condition progressively improved and ventilation was gradually withdrawn. On day 14, further chest CT scans revealed a clear improvement in radiological findings, with reduced alveolar opacities, reduced density of consolidations, with evidence of some ground-glass opacities, peripheral reticular opacities, and reduced pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
