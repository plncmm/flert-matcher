Anamnesis
A 17-year-old woman with atopic dermatitis that was difficult to control. After a lack of response to phototherapy (narrowband UVB), cyclosporine was prescribed, but the patient discontinued it after 2 months due to little improvement. Her personal history included severe congenital mitral prolapse and secondary heart failure. On this occasion, she presented to the emergency department with fever of 39oC with general malaise, rhinorrhoea, arthralgias in the feet and hands, mucous vomiting, watery diarrhoea and acral skin lesions of 6 days' evolution. The patient reported having been camping in a farmhouse.

Physical examination
Several intensely painful erythematous-violaceous subcutaneous nodules were seen on the feet and hands. In addition, there were areas of pale skin with diffuse borders in acral areas with slow capillary refill. No necrotic skin areas were observed. There was also generalised xerosis with skin thickening in folds and erosions secondary to scratching.

Complementary examinations
- Blood tests: anaemia, platelets and elevated acute phase reactants.
- Serology: negative (chlamydia, coxiella, mycoplasma, bartonella, francisella tularensis, treponema, rickettsia, salmonella, CMV, parvovirus, enterovirus, EBV, HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV and rubella).
- Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram: negative for warts.
- Peripheral blood gram stain: growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters
- Blood culture: growth of Staphylococcus Aureus

Diagnosis
Osler nodules in the context of bacterial endocarditis in a patient with congenital valvular heart disease and poorly controlled atopic dermatitis.

Treatment
Cloxacillin and daptomycin intravenously and supportive care.

Evolution
After several days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient's general condition improved, blood cultures were negative and the skin lesions decreased until they disappeared completely. No residual ischaemic lesions of the skin or other organs were observed. The patient became aware of the importance of good control of her AD and is currently adherent to cyclosporine.
