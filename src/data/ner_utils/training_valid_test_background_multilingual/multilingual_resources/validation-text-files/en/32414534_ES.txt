A 69-year-old man with fever and cough of 7 days' duration was admitted to the University Hospital of Guadeloupe (French Indies) with disorientation and severe headache. He had no previous history and reported having travelled to the Middle East (holiday cruise) with his wife 15 days prior to hospitalisation. He reported no insect bites. One week after returning home, he developed fever, myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia, cervical pain, stiff neck and diarrhoea. On admission, he reported a worsening of his condition in the last 24 hours, with stiffness and pain in the back of the neck, severe headache, disorientation, inability to walk, with falls, and dyspnoea. Of note, his wife had also been suffering from cough and ageusia for the past 10 days. On examination, the patient was febrile (38.5°C) with diffuse headache, nuchal rigidity, altered consciousness (14 on the Glasgow Coma Scale), disorientation, dysphagia and right hemiparesis. Respiratory rate was high (36 r.p.m.), pulse was 95 l.p.m., blood pressure was 160/89 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Laboratory tests showed increased C-reactive protein (95 mg/L) and creatine kinase (655 U/L), increased transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase = 85 U/L, alanine aminotransferase = 94 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (442 U/L). Arterial partial pressure of oxygen was low at 64 mmHg, with normal arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and pH. A chest CT scan was highly indicative of COVID-19. The cerebrospinal fluid was only lymphocytic, without erythrocytes, and showed elevated proteinorrachia (84 mg/dL) and normal glycorrhachia. A brain MRI with gadolinium was normal. Electroencephalogram showed bilateral decreased activity without seizures. SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR was negative in nasopharyngeal swab and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on days 2 and 4 after admission, but positive in bronchoalveolar lavage on day 5. Using similar biological resources, results for influenza virus were negative. RT-PCR for varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and enterovirus in CSF were all negative. Other tests for infections endemic to our area were also negative. The patient received nasal oxygen therapy. He was given i.v. acyclovir for 3 days, and was withdrawn when RT-PCR for HSV was negative. Treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg three times daily and azithromycin 250 mg daily for 7 days. On day 4 of hospitalisation his neurological status improved, with normal consciousness and decreased dysphagia. At discharge, on day 10 after admission, he still had some mild neuropsychiatric manifestations, with some impairment of executive functions. The MoCA index decreased to 26/30.
