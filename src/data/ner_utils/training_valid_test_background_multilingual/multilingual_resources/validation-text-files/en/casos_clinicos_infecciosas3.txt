This is a 46-year-old woman diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 12 years ago, under follow-up in the Digestive Department. From the gastrointestinal point of view, she has presented almost annual outbreaks of her disease, requiring admission for control on two occasions. For the last two years, she has been controlled with mesalazine 3 mg every 24 hours, sulfasalazine 4 mg every 12 hours and azathioprine 50 mg every 12 hours. She has presented poor clinical tolerance when trying to reduce the dose of azathioprine, with an increase in the number of bowel movements. In these circumstances, he takes beclomethasone and prednisone. She has no other personal history of interest. Active life and no toxic habits. Previously asymptomatic, the patient began to suffer from an insidious and variegated picture of cervical pain, torticollis and progressive headache over a month and a half. For this reason, she attended the emergency department on several occasions, where, after assessment, she was discharged with analgesic treatment, suspecting cervical contracture. Subsequently, she presented a progressive clinical worsening with increasing pain intensity, general malaise, fever and odynophagia, and so she returned to the hospital.
On this occasion, the patient presented a fair general condition, despite the constants maintained: temperature 37.5oC, blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm. Face oedematous and swollen, neck painful on cervical mobilisation and palpation, no masses or fluctuant collections, no adenopathies, no skin erythema. No cervical, supraclavicular or sternal crepitus. The oral cavity showed intravillous tonsils without plaques, no uvula, no swollen pharynx. The rest of the cardiorespiratory and abdominal examination showed no data of interest.
Laboratory tests showed elevated acute phase reactants with CRP 230 mg/L; neutrophilia without leukocytosis, platelets 496000, INR 1.19, fibrinogen 850 mg/dL, and no other findings of interest. The study was completed with an urgent CT scan showing retropharyngeal thickening at the level of the nasopharynx and oropharynx as well as soft tissue enlargement in front of the C2 body and posterior arch of C1 with no epidural component. He detected erosion of the anterosuperior angle of the C3 body and the anterior cortex of the atlas. The findings suggest retropharyngeal and upper cervical perivertebral abscess. In view of the imaging test and the patient's clinical repercussions, it was decided to admit the patient to Otorhinolaryngology for drainage of the abscess. Empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Differential diagnosis
Deep cervical infections (DCI) have reduced in incidence due to the development of antibiotic therapy; however, they are potentially lethal conditions and susceptible to serious complications. They develop in virtual spaces limited by aponeuroses that are not very resistant to the spread of infection between them (MRI of the cervical spine (T2 sequence): prevertebral abscess and peidural collection (C2-C3)). Peritonsillar, maseterine, pterygo-maxillary, retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, submandibular, parotid and floor of mouth (Ludwig's angina) abscesses can be distinguished. The most frequent aetiological agent of these infections is bacteria, which originate from septic foci in the oral cavity, such as teeth, parotid gland, cervical lymph nodes, middle ear or sinusoids1. The main bacteria isolated are viridans group streptococci, 2-5 followed by anaerobes of the oral cavity such as Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella spp and Actinomyces spp. Other less frequent causes include infection by Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or fungal infections. In these cases, it is mandatory to look for some form of immunosuppression, such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, deficiency state or HIV. Correct anatomical localisation of the abscess by means of imaging tests is essential, as the most frequent aetiology varies accordingly. Focusing on infections of the prevertebral space, the most frequent cause is gram-positive microorganisms, mainly S. aureus, which can cause spondylodiscitis by haematogenous dissemination. Streptococcus is the second most frequent cause in surgical patients. Less common causes are gram-negative bacilli, among which E.coli is the most prevalent, although cases of Pseudomonas spp and Enterobacter spp have also been reported, and fungal infections are very rare entities. Isolated cases of Aspergillus spp, Candida spp, Coccidioides spp and Blastomyces spp have been reported.
The possibility of a tuberculous abscess must also be considered, which may involve bone involvement (tuberculous spondylodiscitis or Pott's disease). Most infections originate from microinoculae in the oral cavity or upper respiratory tract, but there may be less frequent causes such as oesophageal or tracheal manipulation, trauma, regional surgery, post-radiotherapy fistulas, congenital cysts or injecting drug use. Another possibility is that they originate from contiguity of vertebral infections (discitis or osteomyelitis). Alarm symptoms are dyspnoea, stridor, increased cervical volume, pain on palpation in the floor of the mouth, sialorrhoea and bulging of the pharyngeal wall. Complications of abscesses can range from loco-regional infectious conditions to severe septic conditions due to dissemination of the infectious inoculum or rupture of the wall, causing mediastinitis, necrotising fasciitis or osteomyelitis. In some cases, the inflammation may promote thrombus formation in the vessels, leading to thrombophlebitis. The most severe manifestation of the condition is Lemierre's syndrome, which consists of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and metastatic infections.
The diagnosis of PCI is primarily clinical. Imaging studies, especially CT, will help by delimiting the extent of the process and detecting the presence of abscessed areas. Plain radiography can identify the odontogenic origin of the infection, the extension to the thorax, or can demonstrate an increase in soft tissue at the prevertebral level in the pharyngeal area. Cervical ultrasound allows visualisation of the soft tissues, being a non-invasive test that provides information on the location, size, relationship with neighbouring structures and content of the lesion. 
MRI (T2 sequence) spondylodiscitis resolving at the end of treatment.
However, the gold standard for this type of deep infection is still CT with contrast. Medico-surgical treatment should be started early, taking into account the location of the PCI and the compromises it causes. Cultures can be obtained from the incision, which offer greater microbiological precision than blood cultures, and the affected tissue can be debrided, which is the most effective treatment. 

Evolution
During her admission, various imaging tests were performed (CT without and with contrast and MRI) with initial discrepancy as to the location of the abscess, considering retropharyngeal versus prevertebral location, with the aetiological and microbiological implications that this entails. It was finally concluded to be prevertebral. The patient's evolution was torpid, with a prolonged admission of almost a month in Otorhinolaryngology. On admission, surgical drainage of the abscess was performed, after which, in subsequent radiological controls, a progressive growth of the abscess was observed, extending from the foramen magnum to the C4-C5 space, with a maximum diameter of 7.8cm, as well as anterior and posterior cortical disruption in the body of C2-C3, all of these findings compatible with osteomyelitis of probable haematogenous origin.
Given the findings, it was necessary to operate on the patient on two more occasions. A culture of the cervical exudate, obtained after surgical drainage, isolated azole-sensitive Candida albicans. After initiation of targeted treatment with fluconazole 400mg/12h, the patient had a good clinical and radiological response, with only mild discomfort persisting.
After six months of treatment with fluconazole every 12 hours and a tapering prednisone regimen, complete resolution of the spondylodiscitis has been achieved. The patient is currently being followed up in the outpatient infectious diseases department.

Final diagnosis
Prevertebral abscess due to Candida albicans secondary to cervical infectious spondylodiscitis probably haematogenous in an immunosuppressed patient.
