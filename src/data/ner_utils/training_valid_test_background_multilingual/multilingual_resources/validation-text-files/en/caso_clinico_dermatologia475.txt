We present a 39-year-old patient who came to our allergy clinic reporting itching of the hands and eczematous lesions for 6 months, with little improvement after the use of emollients and topical corticosteroids. On the other hand, he reported a clear improvement during holidays and weekends.

In relation to his place of work, the patient has been working for 7 years in a factory where different metals are handled and worked with, both as raw materials and with tools, for the production of more durable and corrosion-resistant alloys, having been assigned to different areas of the factory with different degrees and levels of exposure to vanadium and other heavy metals without using gloves or protective measures (mask, goggles, etc.) intermittently. He currently reports having been working for 8 months in an alloy polishing and finishing area, with large quantities of metal dust in suspension and not having used these protective measures during the entire working day (except for direct handling of metal cylinders and work tools).

Looking further into his health history, he does not refer to any surgeries or other possibilities of having metal prostheses in his body (joint prostheses, dental prostheses, etc.), being ruled out, among other things, after observing the absence of scars on his body.

After taking the clinical history, we carried out:
- Prick test aeroallergens: with the main mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Lepidoglyphus destructor), pollens (Olea europeae, Lolium perenne, Cupressus arizonica, Platanus acerifolia, Salsola Kali, Parietaria judaica), fungi (Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus), epithelia (dog, cat, horse), latex and panallergens (Pru p 3, profilin, polcalcin), being negative after immediate reading at 20 minutes, presenting a positive control of 5 mm performed with histamine dichlorohydrate.
- Blood vanadium levels: 0.5 mg/ml (within normal range).
- Vanadium levels in urine: negative.
- Epicutaneous True Test® (Martí Tor®): negative.
- Epicutaneous with a metal battery (Bial-Arístegui®; Zamudio; Spain): positive for vanadium 48 hours after the test.
The tests were read at 48 and 96 hours following the EAACI criteria for positivity.
