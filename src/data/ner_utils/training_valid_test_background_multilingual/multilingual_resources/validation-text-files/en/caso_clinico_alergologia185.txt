Since he was a few months old, he presented 6 annual episodes of wheezing, lasting 10-15 days, without nasal symptoms. She was diagnosed with non-allergic childhood asthma and followed bronchodilator treatment with good initial response. She stopped attending check-ups.

Referred again at the age of 9 years for worsening in the last 2 years: fortnightly bronchial symptoms, despite treatment with inhaled budesonide, associated with chronic hydrorrhoea and cough with expectoration. Three pneumonias.

Inspection: acropaquias. Auscultation: some isolated wheezing.
- Negative skin tests with pneumoallergens.
- Spirometry: obstructive pattern, positive bronchodilator test.
- Sinus X-ray: bilateral maxillary sinus veiling.
- CT scan of the sinuses: pansinupathy not very expressive
- Thoracic CT scan: normal
- CBC, biochemistry, immunoglobulins, complement and alpha-1 antitrypsin normal.
- Sweat test: normal.
- Eosinophilia in nasal exudate: 20%.
- Sputum culture: Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Maintenance treatment was changed (Salmeterol/fluticasone 25/125, Montelukast 5 mg) and antibiotherapy was prescribed.
In the following months he continued with frequent hydrorrhoea and repeated respiratory infections, confirmed by sputum cultures.
At the age of 11, he required hospital admission for the first time due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Chest CT scan showed bronchiectasis in the lingula and right base, and she was diagnosed with Kartagener's syndrome. The nasal mucosa biopsy was not representative due to the absence of cilia in the sample.
