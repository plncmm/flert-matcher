A 31-year-old woman, otherwise healthy, presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, congestion, rhinorrhoea, cough, myalgia, vomiting and colic, of five days' duration. She worked in a factory, but had not been exposed to symptomatic contacts and was not a smoker, drinker or user of illegal substances. On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure 97/73 mmHg, pulse 127 bpm, respiratory rate 18 r.p.m.; she was 95% saturated with oxygen therapy and had persistent fever despite administration of acetaminophen. On examination, she appeared ill, uncomfortable and in severe discomfort. Initial tests revealed hypernatraemia, acute renal injury and bilateral chest X-ray infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia. Symptomatic treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and i.v. hydration was started and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for COVID-19. Her hypoxia and fever worsened, with increasing oxygen demand, which progressed to hypotension and tachypnoea; the patient required intubation and sedation and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).
A chest CT scan was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) dropping to 77.5, consistent with severe ARDS. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Treatment was initiated with a regimen of hydroxychloroquine and optimised for assisted ventilation for lung protection. Initial COVID-19 testing indicated cytokine crisis, while a high A-a gradient associated with a V/Q imbalance was consistent with the L phenotype of COVID-19.
She was given a short course of anticoagulants. She was placed in prone position with intermittent paralysation to improve oxygenation and synchronise her with the ventilator. On daily wakefulness testing, she showed obvious features of disorientation and encephalopathy. During saturation and withdrawal of paralysation, new onset left hand floppiness was noted. The result was subtle and the patient could not be assessed according to the NIH neurological assessment scale because of her inability to follow commands. However, brainstem reflexes were maintained, with photomotor and cough reflex, spontaneous breathing ability and pain response. Delays in obtaining an urgent head CT were caused by his positive COVID-19 and an equivocal picture of pseudo-stroke. After establishing appropriate precautions, the CT scan result was irrelevant for acute or subacute haemorrhage or infarction. Treatment with atorvastatin and aspirin was started for secondary prevention while COVID-19 tests were repeated to determine the evolution of the disease. A second CT scan revealed ischaemic changes in the region supplied by the right middle cerebral artery, consistent with a cortical stroke. A follow-up echocardiogram and hypercoagulability test were negative, as well as ultrasound scans of the upper and lower extremities to look for sources of thrombus for deep vein thrombosis. After prolonged ventilation and nasogastric feeding, he underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic endoscopic gastrotomy tube.
Over the next few days, improvements in his mental activity were noted, with his eyes opening and tracking, and the ability to begin to follow commands. Physiotherapy assessments showed low mobility scores and severe disability, as well as periods of disorientation. Overall, she continued to improve, with the ability to tolerate breathing tests and follow commands. After a poor prognosis was determined, she was discharged to a rehabilitation centre.
