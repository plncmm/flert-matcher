We present the case of a 79-year-old woman with a personal history of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, on chronic treatment with torasemide 5 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, enalapril 20 mg and metformin 850 mg. She went to the emergency department with a facial skin reaction and bilateral eyelid oedema, which she attributed to the use of cream applied to the nostrils, so after examination she was discharged home with antihistamine and prescribed corticosteroid. Within 24 hours of this first visit, she presented a fever of 39oC with pruritic rash on the face and neck accompanied by skin desquamation. He reported cough without expectoration with watery rhinorrhoea. No worsening of usual dyspnoea (functional class II). No changes in chronic treatment. Physical examination: blood pressure 103/64, temperature 36.7Â°C, heart rate 92, oxygen saturation 97%, baseline conscious and oriented, normal colour, normohydrated, eupneic. Presence of butterfly wing erythema with chondritis in the left auricle and significant palpebral oedema with skin desquamation. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic tones without murmurs or extratones, bilateral normoventilation. Abdomen: globular, soft, depressible, non-painful, preserved peristalsis, no masses or palpable visceromegaly. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Erythematous pharynx with no exudates or plaques.

Laboratory tests: CBC: 18,500 leukocytes, 82.4% neutrophils, haemoglobin 12.4, haematocrit 37.8, platelets 210,000, ESR 105, CRP 11.8, INR 1.07, TTP 24.6, PT 12.2, prothrombin activity 91, fibrinogen 9.1. Glucose 304, creatinine, 10, chlorine 103, potassium 5.2, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, transaminases and LDH within normal. Chest X-ray: no acute pleuroparenchymal findings. Microbiology: negative blood cultures. Thoracoabdominal CT scan: no findings of interest. Dermatology consultation sheet: compatible with Sweet's syndrome.
 Evolution: After being assessed by dermatology, the patient was admitted to the internal medicine department for treatment with antibiotherapy and intravenous corticosteroids, with progressive improvement of the clinical picture. A haematology assessment was requested: haemogram with neutrophilia with a decreasing left deviation, no blast cells were observed. Thrombocytopenia not confirmed by microscopy, probably of infectious origin with good response to corticoids and antibiotics. An appointment was made with the haematology outpatient clinic to assess the normalisation of the haemogram. The patient was discharged home with a final diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome.
