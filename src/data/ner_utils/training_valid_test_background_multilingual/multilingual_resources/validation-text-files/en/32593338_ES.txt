A 16-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department in Lombardy with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm, which had started one hour earlier. The previous day he had had a fever of 38.3°C, which had subsided with 100 mg of nimesulide. She reported no other symptoms, had no history and had no contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. His vital signs were normal, except for his temperature, which was 38.5 °C. Chest auscultation showed normal heart tones, no pericardial friction rub and no abnormal respiratory signs. There was no lymphadenopathy, no rash, and no areas of chest wall pain on palpation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed inferolateral ST-segment elevation and a transthoracic echocardiogram showed hypokinesia of the inferior and inferolateral segments of the left ventricle, with an ejection fraction of 52%; no pericardial effusion was observed. Analyses showed increased ultrasensitive cardiac troponin I (9449 ng/L), creatine phosphokinase (671.0 U/L), C-reactive protein (32.5 mg/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (276.0 U/L). The leucocyte count was 12.75 × 109 per L, neutrophil count 10.04 × 109 per L and lymphocyte count 0.78 × 109 per L. Aspirin was administered for pain mitigation and the patient was transferred to the coronary ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis. The pain gradually subsided and, after 2 h, had completely disappeared. However, during the first night, he reported chest pain; ECG was repeated, but no relevant changes were observed. Treatment with i.v. ibuprofen 600 mg three times a day was started and both his symptoms and fever subsided. Autoantibody and cardiotropic virus tests were negative. On day 3, a nasopharyngeal swab test for acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, so treatment with hydroxychloroquine and antivirals was initiated. Repeated measurements of the patient's troponin concentration showed a gradual reduction from a peak of 16,862 ng/L on day 1 to 39 ng/L on day 8. Inflammatory markers also returned to normal values and the ST-segment elevation on the ECG resolved. On day 11, after two nasopharyngeal swabs obtained on consecutive days were negative, the MRI T2-weighted STIR sequence showed changes consistent with the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. On day 12, the patient was in good condition and asymptomatic and was discharged.
