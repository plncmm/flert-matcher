Anamnesis
Male infant aged 5 months, healthy and with no history of interest. He was seen in the emergency department for skin lesions of 15 days' evolution that started on the left flank and later spread to the rest of the trunk and upper limbs. The mother reported vigorous scratching and inability to fall asleep at night. She had not presented fever or any other apparent symptoms, and was in good general condition. Her paediatrician prescribed treatment with topical hydrocortisone without improvement. No family members presented pruritus or skin lesions. He had not been given any medication prior to the onset of the symptoms nor had he had any contact with animals.

Physical examination
The patient was in good general condition and afebrile. The skin showed papules, pustules, vesicles and erythematous and crusted nodules distributed extensively over the entire trunk and to a lesser extent on the upper limbs. There were also areas of erythematous, scaly patches with an eczematous appearance, predominantly on the left flank. No lesions were observed on the face, scalp, neck, genitalia or palmar-plantar areas. There were no palpable adenopathies.

Complementary examinations
Dermoscopy revealed a keratotic lesion with a linear whitish course and a small dark brown triangular image at one end. Skin biopsy showed an acanthotic epidermis with intense spongiosis, vesiculation and exocytosis of lymphocytes and eosinophils. In the superficial and mid dermis there was an interstitial and perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and abundant eosinophils, with images of vasculopathic damage, endothelial swelling and haematic extravasation. Finally, after serial sections, subcorneal intraepidermal microorganisms compatible with sarcoptes were observed.

Diagnosis
Scabies

Treatment
Permethrin 5% cream was prescribed (application at night including face, scalp and body, maintaining the cream for 8 hours), 1 application every 7 days, repeating a total of 2 applications; and methylprednisolone 1mg/g cream, 1 application every 24 hours.

Evolution
After completing the two cycles of permethrin, there was a marked improvement in the papular, vesicular and pustular lesions, although some nodular lesions remained, so a third application of permethrin was indicated. The eczematous lesions resolved completely.
