At the age of two years, the child presented immediately after eating a small piece of fuet (Espetec, Tarradellas house), intense lip oedema lasting hours and on two occasions, mild urticaria after contact. At 3 years of age, similar episode after ingestion of ham (handled with gloves used with other sausages).
Allergological study (3 years and 3 months): Prick test: Histamine: 8x6mm. Penicillium notatum 13x8mm Prick prick: Fuet (skin) 9x6mm. Fuet (without skin) (-). Provocation negative with fuet without skin.

Positive provocation (6 months later) by contact on labial mucosa with fuet (with skin), with erythema and small wheals. Positive oral provocation with fuet (with skin), after ingesting 15 grams, presenting bilateral conjunctival injection, more in the left eye, with lacrimation.

The manufacturer confirms the use of Penicillium nalgiovense in the casing of the fuet, identifying the genus of the fungus in the casing by genetic analysis as Penicillium sp. By means of SDS-PAGE immunoblotting, both Penicillium sp. (from the skin of fuet) and Penicillium notatum, high IgE binding in a band of approximately 17-18 kDa; another of lower intensity of 31/30 kDa and binding in high molecular masses in Penicillium sp.

We highlight this case for its precocity. Food and contact allergy to the Penicillium present in the fuet wrapper is demonstrated, and an IgE-binding band of molecular mass (18 kDa) similar to that observed in other published cases is detected. The patient is advised to avoid foods containing fungi.
