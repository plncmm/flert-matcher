Reason for consultation
Acute low back pain and urinary retention.

Anamnesis
34-year-old woman with acute low back pain. No improvement in primary care after 2 weeks of treatment with NSAIDs, corticosteroids and muscle relaxants, she went to the hospital emergency department where she was diagnosed with non-specific lumbosciatica, prescribed treatment and referred to the Traumatology department. That afternoon she became unable to urinate. The following morning at her health centre she underwent transitional bladder catheterisation. That same afternoon she returned to the health centre for pain, anaesthesia in the perineum and bladder balloon, and was referred to the hospital emergency department, where she was admitted with a diagnosis of incomplete cauda equina syndrome (lumbosciatica with paraesthesia and anaesthesia of the left hemiperineum and urinary retention, mild left L5 and S1 paresis and constipation for 4 days). On X-ray, decreased L5S1 space. MRI: Extruded disc herniation L5S1.

Family approach
Homoparental family unit. Stage I formation of the life cycle, with a conjugal relationship without children. She is a housewife. Husband works outside. Lives in a rural environment.

Clinical Judgement
Cauda equina syndrome.

Differential diagnosis
Classic non-specific sciatica.

Action plan
- Hospital: Analgesia, catheterisation and urgent intervention within 48 hours (left central L5S1 discectomy).
- Primary Care: Removal of catheter, referral to Urology and rehabilitation treatment with physiotherapy.

Evolution
One week later, improvement of paraesthesia, sensory improvement of the perineum, no control of urination (remains with catheter) and rectal tenesmus. Follow-up urology consultation for catheter removal. After 3 months in the rehabilitation phase, without catheter with urination with effort, defecation with assistance, low back pain with preserved strength of MMII.
