39-year-old male, no personal history of interest. No toxic habits, no regular medication. His family history includes a recent parasitosis caused by Giardia lamblia in his two children. No contact with animals or rural environment. No consumption of unsanitised products. She had travelled to Sierra Leone as a tourist for 3 years and to Thailand for 6 years without any relevant health problems.
She came to the Infectious Diseases Department of our centre for the presence of pruritic nodular skin lesions (Figures 1 and 2) of 1 year's evolution on the upper limbs, pinnae, hips and back. Some of these lesions had ulcerated. There was no evidence of superinfection on examination.
The anamnesis was negative and the physical examination, apart from the aforementioned, was unremarkable.
Laboratory tests were performed (PCR, ESR, liver tests, renal function and haemogram), serology for Anisakis and larva migrans, stool culture, parasite stool culture, microscopic stool examination by Kinyoun stain (Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia intestinalis) and Graham's test for Enterobius vermicularis, skin biopsy and cultures.
Dermatology was consulted and the lesions were diagnosed as nodular prurigo.
After reasonably ruling out organicity, the patient was provisionally diagnosed with Ekbom's Syndrome (delusional parasitosis) and treatment with aripiprazole and pregabalin was indicated. The patient initially rejected both the diagnosis and the treatment and even managed to convince his wife and children that they were suffering from the same disease.
After 2 months of frequent consultations, the patient accepted his diagnosis and started treatment with aripiprazole 2.5 (1-0-0) and pregabalin 75 (0-0-1) with improvement of his symptoms after 3 weeks of treatment. The patient also admitted the diagnosis and gradually realised that he did not suffer from any organic disease, and his relationship with his wife and children also improved. After 3 months since the onset of the clinic, he had become aware of the disease and is now symptom-free.
