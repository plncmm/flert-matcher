Anamnesis
A 63-year-old man, with no personal history of interest, working in a bazaar. He consulted for persistent lesions on the face and neck, slightly pruritic, for a year, which improved with antifungals and corticosteroids but recurred immediately.

Physical examination
On examination, erythematous, scaly, non-infiltrated, well-defined, erythematous plaques were observed in the cervicofacial region.

Complementary examinations
Contact tests were performed for the standard series, fragrances and corticoids, with positive results for nickel, parthenolide and the sesquiterpene lactone mixture.

Diagnosis
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to plants.

Treatment
By eliminating contact, both topically and directly by manipulation, the clinical condition resolved.

Evolution
On reinterrogating the patient, we discovered that he frequently used cosmetics, which he associated with worsening of the symptoms, and that he handled plants at work, reporting improvement during holidays. It was decided to extend the tests with the series of plants, preservatives and with the three proprietary products, finding in the first test intense positivity to multiple allergens and to all the proprietary products, which contained multiple plant extracts, which contained multiple plant extracts).
