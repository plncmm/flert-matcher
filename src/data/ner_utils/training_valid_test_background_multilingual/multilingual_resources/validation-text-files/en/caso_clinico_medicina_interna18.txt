A 72-year-old hypertensive woman treated with candesartan, and with a history of ischaemic stroke with partial motor crises secondary to treatment with ASA, atorvastatin and lamotrigine, who was admitted from the emergency department for non-radiating low back pain of mechanical characteristics of 2 and a half months' evolution, accompanied by general syndrome and occasional fever. She was initially treated with NSAIDs without improvement and was bedridden. She denied digestive symptoms or any other associated symptomatology. Examination revealed only obesity and a stony, painful mass with associated inflammatory signs in the left lumbar fossa; blood tests showed mild anaemia (Hb 10 g/dl) normocytic, mild leukocytosis (12600/mm3) at the expense of neutrophils, and significant elevation of C-reactive protein (220 mg/dl). The plain X-ray of the lumbosacral spine showed the presence of gas in the soft tissues of the posterior region at L2-L3, so a thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed, showing a 13x9 cm abscess with gas bubbles extending from the retroperitoneum, affecting the fascia of the psoas and iliac muscle and the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the posterior wall of the left hemiabdomen. Adjacent to the mass, diverticular images were seen in the left colon and sigmoid colon with a segment of mural thickening, deflecting and a fistulous tract. In addition, there were multiple hypodense images in the spleen compatible with abscesses, and a small associated bilateral pleural effusion.

Evolution
With the diagnosis of acute perforated diverticulitis with abscessification, a catheter was placed under CT control for percutaneous drainage, and purulent material was extracted and sent to microbiology. Blood cultures were negative, while the abscess culture was positive for aerobic and anaerobic polymicrobial flora, compatible with faecal matter. He received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin-Tazobactam for 4 weeks with good tolerance and no side effects. Subsequent microbiological control cultures isolated more resistant microorganisms among the polymicrobial flora, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, as a consequence of the antibiotic pressure phenomenon. The clinical evolution was favourable, remaining afebrile and asymptomatic, allowing reintroduction and progress in oral tolerance. In the subsequent imaging control, no purulent collection was observed, although a colo-cutaneous fistulous tract persists, currently under outpatient follow-up pending surgical intervention due to suppuration months after hospital discharge.
