A 40-year-old man, with no known drug allergies, toxic habits or personal history of interest, attended the emergency department for an afternoon fever of up to 38o C of 3 weeks' duration. The febrile fever was accompanied by an episode of profuse sweating and asthenia lasting more than one and a half months. The patient also reported occasional arthralgias in the shoulders and lumbar region, which he related to his work (construction). He denied otorhinolaryngological, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous or urological symptoms. As epidemiological antecedents, he had contact with a horse and a dog, but the latter was correctly vaccinated.

During the physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented, in good general condition. Eupneic at rest, tolerating decubitus, afebrile and haemodynamically stable with blood pressure of 135/65 mmHg. Basal oxygen saturation was 100%. The temporal arteries were beating symmetrically. Examination of the external ear, middle ear, mouth and pharynx was normal. No lymph nodes were palpable in the cervical region. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: rhythmic tones at 95 bpm, without murmurs, friction or extratones and preserved vesicular murmur, without added pathological noises. The abdomen was soft, depressible, without masses or organomegaly and not painful. The lower limbs had no oedema or signs of ischaemia or venous thrombosis. The neurological examination was also normal. The initial complementary tests performed in the emergency department were: blood tests with haemogram and biochemistry, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. The blood test showed no abnormalities, except for elevated acute phase reactants with C-reactive protein of 74 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 84 mm/h. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, normal cardiac axis, narrow QRS complexes and no acute repolarisation abnormalities. Chest X-ray showed no remarkable pleuroparenchymal alterations. Blood samples were obtained for blood cultures. In view of the clinical manifestations and the results of the complementary tests described above, it was decided to admit the patient to the infectious diseases ward for study and treatment.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis should be considered with all causes of prolonged febrile syndrome. Intra-abdominal abscesses, mononucleosis syndromes (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, etc.), extrapulmonary and disseminated tuberculosis should be ruled out. On the other hand, it should be considered that the origin may be tumoural, which is frequent in leukaemias, carcinomas (especially colon, renal, hepatocarcinoma or metastatic lesions), sarcomas, and typically, in atrial myxoma. Rheumatic fever, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and hypercoagulable states such as antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus anticoagulant should also be considered. Complementary tests that help us to guide the diagnosis include peripheral blood smears, proteinogram, blood levels of thyroid hormones and angiotensin-converting enzyme, autoimmunity studies, virus and bacterial serologies, cultures (sputum, blood, urine and faeces), imaging tests such as ultrasound, echocardiography, and even computerised axial tomography.

Evolution
On admission, following the verbal report from the microbiology department of growth after 24 hours of gram-positive cocci in a chain of difficult typing in the blood cultures taken in the emergency department, empirical antibiotherapy with ceftriaxone and gentamicin was established in accordance with current clinical guidelines and new blood cultures were requested. From the ward, the study was extended with autoimmunity tests, with negative results for all autoantibodies. The internal medicine and thyroid profiles were normal, with a procalcitonin level of 0.1 ng/mL. The study of plasma proteins by proteinogram was normal, as was the immunoglobulin study. The tumour markers studied were within the normal range. The serologies requested were: Epstein-Bar virus, cytomegalovirus and Parvovirus B19, all IgG positive and IgM negative. HIV screening was negative. The following serologies were also requested: Toxoplasma spp, Brucella spp, Yersinia spp, Salmonella, Mycoplasma spp, Chlamydia spp, Legionella spp, Ricketsia spp, Coxiella spp, Borrelias spp, and Hepatitis A, B and C. All were reported as negative.

Both the chest X-ray and the dorsal-lumbar spine X-ray showed no remarkable alterations. Subsequently, treatment was modified upon confirmation of Granulicatella elegans growth in the two blood culture bottles, with targeted antimicrobial treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin, thus decreasing the levels of acute phase reactants. During his admission, a change was noted in the patient's auscultation; it was a rough ejection murmur in the aortic focus, so given the high suspicion of infective endocarditis, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing severe aortic regurgitation secondary to bicuspid valve and a nodular image of 14x 6mm of calcium density on it (possible vegetation) and dilatation of the left ventricular cavity with preserved ejection fraction. Transthoracic echocardiogram: vegetation on the aortic valve.
Transesophageal echocardiography was recommended. This showed a bicuspid aortic valve with thickening of both leaflets and calcification in the posterior raphe with an image suggestive of vegetation; severe aortic insufficiency; slight intimal thickening at the level of the descending aorta. The abdominal ultrasound showed a spleen of homogeneous morphology, of increased size (14 cm in length), with the rest of the abdominopelvic examination being normal. Repeated control blood cultures were negative.

Antibiotic treatment was completed with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin for 4 weeks and intravenous amoxicillin until completing 6 weeks of treatment, and the patient was discharged, remaining asymptomatic and in good functional class, with normalisation of analytical parameters.

Subsequently, the patient continued to be followed up in consultations by Cardiology, since as a sequel to the endocarditis he had severe aortic insufficiency requiring surgical valve replacement (due to the change in the patient's functional class).

Final diagnosis
Aortic endocarditis on native valve due to Granulicatella elegans.
