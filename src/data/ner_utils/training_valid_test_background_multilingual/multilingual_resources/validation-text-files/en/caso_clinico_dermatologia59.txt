A 23-year-old Chilean woman, with a history of travelling for work to a vegetable and banana plantation in the rural sector of Sao Paulo (Barra do Turbo), Brazil, for a period of 8 months. He presented with a history of 1.5 months of evolution with erythematous enlargement of the left dorso-lumbar region associated with intermittent stitch-like pain. Physical examination revealed an erythematous nodular lesion with a central orifice and seropurulent exudate. Erythematous nodule approximately 3 cm in diameter with a central orifice and seropurulent exudate located in the left dorso-lumbar region. The patient noticed the spontaneous exit of a larva through the orifice of the lesion. Stage III larva identified as Dermatobia hominis. The larva was yellowish-brown in colour, approximately 2 cm long and had several rows of small black spines in an anterior-posterior arrangement on its cephalic end. The larva was identified as Dermatobia hominis, stage III. Given the clinical and epidemiological context and the morphological characteristics of the larva, a diagnosis of myiasis forunculosa due to Dermatobia hominis was made. Treatment was indicated with oral flucloxacillin, 500 mg every 8 h for 7 days, taking into account the presence of erythema, pain and exudation. The patient was seen for follow-up 1 week later, with excellent evolution, no signs of infection and only post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Dermatobia hominis has an interesting life cycle: the species needs its larvae to develop in a warm-blooded vertebrate host (mammals and accidentally man), constituting an obligate myiasis. Because the fly is not haematophagous, it deposits its eggs in the abdomen of haematophagous arthropods that act as carriers (mosquitoes).
