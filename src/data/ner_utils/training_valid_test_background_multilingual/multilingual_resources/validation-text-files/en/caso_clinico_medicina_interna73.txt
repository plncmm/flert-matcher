A 40-year-old woman with a personal history of Cogan's syndrome, erythema nodosum and hepatitis B virus diagnosed in 2004, on prolonged treatment with azathioprine and prednisone. He was admitted for subacute symptoms of asthenia, fever and dyspnoea. Physical examination revealed tachypnoea at rest, scattered crackles and wheezing on pulmonary auscultation. Blood tests: leukocytes: 24,100 mm, neutrophils: 77.5%, haemoglobin: 7 g/dl, with normal mean cropuscular volume, platelets: 1,327 mm, CRP: 143 mg/dl. Arterial blood gas: pH: 7.55 . PC02: 30 . P02: 51, chest X-ray: bilateral parahilar and peribronchovascular reticulo-nodular opacities, predominantly in both lung bases, associated with right pleural effusion. Twelve hours after admission, his dyspnoea worsened, and ventilatory support was started with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (BiPAP), and antibiotic treatment and corticotherapy were initiated. After 24 hours he presented progressive deterioration, with haemodynamic instability, requiring vasoactive support. Acute renal failure, lactic metabolic acidosis, continuous pan-focal murmur on cardiac auscultation. An echocardiogram was performed showing severe aortic insufficiency, due to unstructured right coronary leaflet, with prolapse. Left ventricle slightly dilated, with LVEF 55%. Vascular computed tomography shows an important bilateral peribronchovascular alveolar interstitial pattern. Bilateral pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly, with increased calibre of the pulmonary artery cone (3.1 cm) and increased calibre of the intrapulmonary vessels. Given the findings, she was transferred to the cardiac surgery department. Blood cultures, culture of the surgical specimen and luetic serology: negative. The aortic valve was repaired by suture-patch, and the patient progressed favourably. Cogan's syndrome is a rare entity. Its clinical presentation consists of interstitial keratitis, vestibular and auditory dysfunction. It is sometimes associated with systemic vasculitis and aortitis. Aortitis may develop during the course of the disease, being described in approximately 10% of patients, causing proximal aortic dilatation, aortic valve insufficiency, ostial coronary artery disease and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. In the present case, the patient presented with a subacute process, a diagnostic challenge, and finally, given the clinical manifestations, her underlying pathology and imaging tests, a diagnosis of aortitis and severe aortic insufficiency was made. Within the differential diagnosis it was necessary to rule out infectious processes, such as endocarditis, which did not meet the necessary criteria for diagnosis. This was a non-infectious aortitis, related to Cogan's syndrome, which in the literature reviewed is present in approximately 10% of patients. Given that both Cogan's syndrome and aortitis are infrequent pathologies and because of the complexity of the case, it is relevant for us to review and report the clinical case.
