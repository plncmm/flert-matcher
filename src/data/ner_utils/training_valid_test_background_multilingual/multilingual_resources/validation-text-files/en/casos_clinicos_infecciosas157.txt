72-year-old male, ex-smoker of 15 cigarettes a day, with no other toxic habits. His past history includes mild COPD and psoriasis. Diagnosed in January 2017 with epidermoid carcinoma of the pyriform sinus (cT4cN3M0) for which he started neoadjuvant therapy with carboplatin, docetaxel and 5 FU, three cycles, with improvement of the disease on CT scan in May 2017, followed by concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy based on cetuximab; treatment was completed in July and corticotherapy with dexamethasone 4 mg per day was maintained. In September 2017, he attended the emergency department for cough and respiratory secretions with scanty brownish expectoration of 4 days' duration, dyspnoea and a maximum thermometric temperature of 36.4o. He also reported pain in the left hemithorax, which increased with deep inspiration and movement.
On physical examination, the patient was in fair general condition; ECOG 3 (bedridden for more than 50% of the day), cachectic, mucocutaneous dryness and saturation of 95% with MV at 35%. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed rhythmic heart sounds at a good frequency, no murmurs, with a generalised decrease in vesicular murmur and no audible crackles. Abdominal examination with no pathological findings, lower limbs without oedema or signs of thrombosis.
Initial complementary tests showed haemoglobin 12.1 g/dl, 10,980 leukocytes/mm3 with 96% neutrophils; platelets and coagulation were normal. Blood glucose, renal function, ions, LDH, GOT, GPT, lipase and amylase were normal. Antigenuria for pneumococcus and Legionella spp negative. Chest X-ray showed extensive parenchymal involvement with alveolar-interstitial infiltrates, bilateral nodules and cavitations. A chest X-ray performed one month prior to this consultation showed no abnormalities.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of cavitary lesions is very broad and includes neoplastic pathology, various types of infectious processes, abscesses (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, parasitic), septic emboli and immunological pathology, among others.  Pulmonary cavitary lesions comprise a wide range of both benign and malignant entities. It is very important to establish the temporality of the evolution of the process in order to establish an approximate diagnosis, since more acute/subacute lesions point to an infectious aetiology and chronic lesions to a malignant nature.
Neoplasms: Among the pulmonary neoplasms, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most frequently cavitated. This diagnosis is ruled out by the existence of previous normal tests, as is the suspicion of metastatic cavitated lesions. Septic pulmonary emboli: Septic emboli usually manifest radiographically as multiple peripheral lower lobe nodules that may cavitate. The absence of fever and predisposing factors such as right-sided endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, pacemaker infection and parenteral drug addiction make this diagnosis unlikely.
Infections: The presence of immunosuppression in a patient on prolonged doses of corticosteroids, associated with overt respiratory symptoms (cough, expectoration and pleuritic pain), despite the absence of fever, points to an infectious aetiology.
- Fungal infections may manifest as cavitated lesions with walls of variable thickness. In the case of aspergillosis, a predisposing factor in this type of pathogen is cellular immunosuppression caused by the use of corticosteroids, a fact in favour of our case, although it tends to appear more frequently in transplanted or neutropenic patients. A finding that could go against this diagnosis is the absence of the halo sign, which is nothing more than a circular area of attenuation in ground glass surrounding a pulmonary nodule that usually appears after 1-2 weeks. Serum β-D-glucan and galactomannan antigen positivity in serum as well as galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage would support this diagnosis. Mucormycosis usually has a radiological manifestation similar to aspergillosis, particularly present in haematological patients and diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control and ketoacidosis, characterised by episodes of massive haemoptysis, aspects not recorded in our patient's history. The possibility of isolation of Pneumocystis jirovecii is unlikely given that this is not a patient with HIV infection, a typical association with this aetiology.
- Necrotising bacterial pneumonias due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria may be associated with cavitation within a lung consolidation, however, they usually present unilaterally and are usually solitary lesions, which does not coincide with the bilateral and diffuse presentation in our patient. Another aetiology to consider is tuberculosis. The presence of infiltrates in the pulmonary parenchyma with multiple satellite nodules and cavitated lesions are the most frequent radiological manifestation (in 40% of cases), which, together with non-specific respiratory symptoms and cellular immunosuppression, may point to this diagnosis. The acute course of our patient does not favour the suspicion of this diagnosis, as tuberculosis has a more subacute/chronic course. Positive results in certain complementary tests such as gamma interferon, tuberculin skin test or sputum culture would support the diagnosis. The absence of lymphadenopathy works against our patient. The prolonged use of corticotherapy without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and the presence of pulmonary cavitation raises the suspicion of nocardiosis. Definitive diagnosis requires isolation and identification of the organism in routine aerobic cultures (sputum-bronchoalveolar lavage) and blood cultures. The absence of fever and leukocytosis does not rule out this diagnosis.

Evolution
After admission, given the suspicion of tuberculosis, respiratory isolation was indicated, fibrobronchoscopy and sputum culture were requested and empirical treatment was started with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and isoniazid, until the results of the complementary tests were obtained. He remained haemodynamically stable at the beginning, with O2 saturation at 91% with nasal goggles at 2 litres/min, although with desaturations around 85% on room air and respiratory work.
The patient presented a clear clinical worsening in the following days (asthenia, haemodynamic instability, malnutrition, etc.) and rapid radiological progression as seen on chest X-ray, where a clear increase in diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate was observed, and a high-resolution chest CT scan was requested. Laboratory tests showed a decrease in haemoglobin 8.1 g/dl (previously 12.1 g/dl), sustained normalisation of leukocytes 4710/μl (neutrophils 90.0%), potassium 2.75 mmol/L, CRP 282 mg/L (previously 323 mg/L).
Fibrobronchoscopy revealed bilateral dense purulent secretions in both bronchial trees, with samples taken and analysed by anatomical pathology and microbiology for opportunistic germs. Given the rapid evolution, clinical-radiological worsening, three sputum smears with Ziehl Neelsen technique negative for tuberculosis, anti-tuberculosis therapy was suspended and empirical treatment was started with meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amphotericin and corticosteroids. A high-resolution chest CT scan showed extensive pulmonary cavitations, with bilateral involvement, showing cavitations associated with both infiltrates (consolidations) and nodules, and no images of a tree in outbreak indicating clear bronchogenic dissemination. Given the clinical data, morphology and extent of involvement, an infectious involvement should be considered as the first possibility, with atypical germs being the most likely aetiology, including mycobacteria, invasive fungal involvement and other less prevalent germs such as Nocardia spp. Pleural effusion of moderate size on the left side and slight size on the right.
Sputum culture, bronchial aspirate and telescopic catheter isolated Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, resistant to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. In bronchioalveolar lavage, galactomannan antigen and Pneumocystis jirovecii antigen were negative. Serum β -D-glucan and galactomannan were also negative. The antibiotic therapy was modified according to the antibiogram obtained, suspending the antifungal drug, maintaining cotrimoxazole with imipenem-amikacin and reducing the dose of corticosteroids.
Despite this antibiotic therapy, the patient developed a rapid clinical deterioration, with septic shock refractory to the measures administered. He died one day after the start of targeted antibiotic therapy.

Final diagnosis
Bilateral pneumonia due to Nocardia cyriacigeorgica in an immunocompromised patient.
2. Septic shock with evidence of refractory acute respiratory failure.
