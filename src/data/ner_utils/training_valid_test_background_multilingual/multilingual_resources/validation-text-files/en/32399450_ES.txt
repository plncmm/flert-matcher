A 34-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and smoking presented to the emergency department with weakness, fever and cough of 4 days' evolution. On admission, his temperature was 37.5°C, pulse was 102 bpm, blood pressure was 133/85 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Decreased breath sounds with crackles in the left lower lung field were noted. Chest radiographs showed interstitial opacities in the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mild lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained because of a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients. After a positive result, the patient was admitted to an infectious diseases ward. Antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine were started. Direct contact between staff and patient was minimised; interaction was mainly via an electronic audio and video link. Visits were prohibited. During hospitalisation, the patient did not develop fever or respiratory distress. However, he developed symptoms consistent with anxiety and insomnia. Symptomatic intervention with a team of social workers was initiated, as well as treatment with brotizolam. On day 7 of hospitalisation, the patient attempted suicide by jumping from the third floor. Contact and droplet precautions were applied and he was transferred to the trauma department. All staff attending the patient wore personal protective equipment. The patient was intubated and transferred under strict anti-infective control measures for a CT scan, which revealed subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages, bladder tear and pelvic fracture.
