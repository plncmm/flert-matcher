A 77 year old man from Ceuta came to the emergency department of this centre with fever and diarrhoea without pathological products for 5 days. His history included the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors: AHT, diabetes mellitus with micro and macrovascular complications in the form of neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy and ischaemic heart disease which required percutaneous revascularisation on several occasions, presenting severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with a residual LVEF of 20%. He also required the placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in 2013. Regarding the diarrhoea, he had not committed any dietary transgressions and did not report consuming unpasteurised products. He had travelled to Morocco several times in his life, but had not visited Morocco in the last two years. Due to the significant deterioration of his general condition with tachycardia and hypotension on examination, it was decided to admit him at this time, starting empirical treatment with piperacillin tazobactam, after collecting microbiological samples for culture. Two days later, both blood and stool cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis resistant only to aminoglycosides, so he was switched to bitherapy with ceftazidime and levofloxacin and antibiotherapy was maintained until two weeks of treatment had elapsed, with subsequent discharge to his home. Eleven days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with a fever of up to 38.5o with shivering for 4 days without apparent focality.
On examination, auscultation revealed crackles in both lung bases attributed to decompensation of heart failure, with no murmurs. No masses or organomegaly were palpable in the abdomen, and no signs of phlebitis were observed.
A haemogram and basic biochemistry were requested in the emergency department, showing: creatinine 1.52 mg/dL (with creatinine levels around 1.5-2.0 mg/dL at baseline), CRP 176 mg/L, Hb 12.2 g/dL, MCV 99.6, leukocytes 14800 with neutrophils 7980, with no other analytical alterations. Chest and abdominal X-rays were also taken and no abnormalities were observed. Given the clinical instability and the evidence of decompensation of his underlying pathology, it was decided to admit him for investigation of the origin of the fever, blood cultures were taken in the emergency department and empirical treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started. Once on the ward, it was found that the same germ as in the previous admission, Salmonella enteritidis, with identical antimicrobial sensitivity, was again isolated in the ED blood cultures.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of fever of intermediate duration without focus includes a wide variety of pathologies ranging from infectious to non-infectious causes (inflammatory, drug-related, etc.). However, in the case of our patient, the epidemiological history of previous admission for enteroinvasive diarrhoea caused by Salmonella enteritidis with associated bacteraemia led us to limit the differential diagnosis to secondary infectious complications of this germ. Among all of them, given his cardiovascular history and above all the placement of a foreign material at cardiac level susceptible to infection (LAD), it is essential to rule out both endocarditis on a native valve and on the LAD. Salmonella spp. endocarditis is a very rare entity. In a review by Cheng WL et al, they found a total of only 87 cases of Salmonella spp. endocarditis in a period between 1976 and 20142. There is usually some cardiac abnormality that acts as a predisposing factor for infection, such as previous valve involvement (53% of cases), or endocardial involvement (30%). The most commonly affected valve is the mitral valve (36.6%) followed by the aortic valve (16.6%)3. Salmonella spp. endocarditis tends to be a very destructive process, associating valve or atrioventricular perforation and abscess formation in a significant number of cases. Mortality was initially very high (up to 42% of those diagnosed) with mortality rates decreasing over time to 13%. Infection of intracardiac devices by this germ, such as pacemaker leads, has also been described in the literature, although infection by gram-positive bacteria is much more frequent. Their management is not entirely clear, although removal of the device is recommended whenever possible in case of persistent occult gram-negative bacteraemia.
Extraintestinal Salmonella spp infections occur in up to 5-10% of Salmonella bacteraemias, and distant involvement of multiple organs such as lung, pleura or joints has been described. There are special hosts with a greater tendency to develop distant infections by Salmonella spp, as is the case of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the form of meningitis in children under one year of age, or the greater risk of bacteraemia and osteomyelitis described in patients affected by sickle cell disease due to Salmonella spp, especially if there was a previous history of avascular necrosis5. Urinary tract infections are also described and usually occur in elderly patients with underlying immunosuppression (diabetes, immunosuppressive therapy). In addition, a significant association with urological malignancies has also been described in some studies. Primary bacteraemias without focality should alert us to the existence of possible immunosuppression, especially the possibility that the patient has an unknown HIV infection with a low CD4 count. In fact, recurrent Salmonella spp. bacteraemia is considered an AIDS-defining illness, and is thought to be apparently due to incomplete clearance of the primary infection due to impaired cell-mediated immunity and impaired regulation of proinflammatory cytokine release6. In case of an epidemiological outbreak, it is necessary to investigate the host or food causing the outbreak. If the origin of the Salmonella spp infection cannot be identified, it may be useful to culture faeces from household contacts involved in direct food handling to screen for chronic carriers who could be the source of infection. Chronic carrier status is defined as the persistence of Salmonella enterica species in faeces or urine for periods longer than 12 months after an acute infection. Chronic carrier Salmonella spp. is associated with excretion of large numbers of micro-organisms in faeces but absence of clinical disease, which is associated with high levels of systemic immunity. The frequency of chronic carrier status is higher in women and in people with biliary tract abnormalities, or with concurrent Schistosoma haematobium infection. Antibiotic use during the course of Salmonella spp. diarrhoea also increases the duration of carrier status, which is why antibiotic treatment is discouraged except in special cases such as patients under 2 years of age or over 50 years of age, patients with prosthetic valves or immunocompromised patients with an increased risk of extraintestinal disease.

Evolution
Given the suspicion of endocarditis, a transthoracic echocardiogram was initially requested, which did not reveal the presence of warts or other signs of infection at the valvular level, and subsequently an abdominal ultrasound scan showed the presence of a mass in the retroperitoneum. The study was completed by abdominal computerised tomography (CT), which revealed the presence of a mycotic juxtarenal aneurysm measuring 1.3 x 2.5 cm in diameter, and the patient was transferred to the vascular surgery department of the Puerta del Mar Hospital in Cadiz for definitive treatment. Due to the high comorbidity of the patient, and the high vital risk involved in repairing the aneurysm, it was decided not to perform open surgery to remove the infected aortic tissue, and instead it was decided to place a vascular endoprosthesis. After two weeks of antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone, a stent was placed and the same antibiotic treatment was maintained for a further month. Subsequent oral treatment was continued with ciprofloxacin 500 mg/12h and in the fourth month of treatment a scan was performed with marked leukocytes which did not show any pathological uptake suggestive of recurrence of infection. Oral ciprofloxacin was maintained for one month until the normalisation of acute phase reactants and the disappearance of clinical signs of infection was confirmed, and it was decided to discontinue antibiotic treatment. It was decided to repeat the scan with labelled leukocytes after the patient had been off antibiotics for 3 months to determine the existence of recurrence of infection; however, before the control scan could be performed, the patient died as a result of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without showing clinical signs of infectious recurrence to date.

Final diagnosis
Mycotic aneurysm due to Salmonella enteritidis.
