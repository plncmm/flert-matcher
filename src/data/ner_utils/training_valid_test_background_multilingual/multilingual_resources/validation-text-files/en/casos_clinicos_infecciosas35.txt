We present the case of a 64-year-old male patient, active smoker of 20 cigarettes/day since youth, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia on treatment with losartan and simvastatin. He came to the emergency department of another centre reporting right lumbar pain of two months' evolution that did not interfere with his usual activity, until it suddenly became more intense and did not subside with first-step analgesia.

On arrival he was conscious, oriented and cooperative, eupneic with baseline oxygen saturation 98%, BP 190/112 mm/Hg, HR 83 bpm, and profuse sweating. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. The abdomen was soft and depressible but painful on palpation in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium with abdominal defence. A blood test was performed in the emergency department showing haemoglobin 13 g/dl, 10180 leukocytes/mm3 with 54.8% neutrophils, creatinine 0.99 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 29 mg/L, ultrasensitive troponin 7.74 ng/L (VN: 0-14) and a chest X-ray with no relevant alterations. Intravenous analgesic treatment was administered without symptomatic improvement, so abdominal ultrasound was requested, which revealed a 6.6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm in the proximal segment with no evidence of rupture. It was decided to complete the study with a thoraco-abdominal CT scan, where a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm was observed with marked thickening of the aortic wall, internal displacement of intimal calcifications, intramural haematoma and thrombus associated with the aneurysm; and another aneurysm, in the infrarenal abdominal aorta extending from immediately at the level of the renal arteries to approximately 1 cm from the iliac bifurcation with an image of a repletion defect compatible with aortic dissection in its lower, posterior and external region.

Given these findings, he was transferred to our hospital for assessment by Cardiac and Vascular Surgery. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and after six days of admission, scheduled surgery was performed on the abdominal aneurysm by means of aorto-aortic bypass and right common iliac to celiac trunk. As a complication, both renal arteries were resected, and a sample of the aortic wall was taken for culture due to the presence of abnormal inflammatory periaortic tissue. The patient had a complicated postoperative period with haemodynamic instability despite treatment with vasoactive drugs and, due to anuria and suspicion of bladder injury, an ultrasound scan was performed and later a CT scan of the abdomen showed, in addition to the post-surgical changes, an intra-aortic repletion defect at the level of the renal arteries and a periaortic collection that encompassed both renal arteries, producing bilateral renal hypoperfusion. The patient was started on continuous veno-venous haemofiltration and after recovering haemodynamic stability, intermittent haemodialysis was started. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 68%, with no abnormalities in contractility, with displacement of the left atrium by the descending aortic aneurysm without other alterations. Analytically, there was an increase in acute phase reactants and clinical signs of respiratory infection, so samples were taken for microbiology (blood cultures, tracheal aspirate culture and urine culture) and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started with a good response. All cultures were negative, except for the culture of the aortic wall taken by the surgeon in which Staphylococcus lugdunensis was isolated, so treatment was started with cloxacillin i.v. (2 g every 8 hours) according to the patient's condition. (2 g every 8 hours) according to the antibiogram.

Differential diagnosis
In summary, the patient was a 64-year-old male with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissecting aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, with isolation of S. lugdunensis in aortic wall culture.

This microorganism is found on human skin and is a species of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, but shares similarity with Staphylococcus aureus in its high virulence and ability to produce suppurative infections. It is a rare contaminant (<20%), and usually presents in patients with immunosuppression or underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, previous surgery or trauma. Clinically, they present with persistent fever (>80%), bacteraemia (85%), anaemia (81%), and sepsis (in more than one third of cases). It is a pathogen responsible for both nosocomial and community infections, and has been associated with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, central nervous system abscesses and soft tissue infections. In infective endocarditis, the overall mortality is between 18 and 38.8%, higher than those caused by S. aureus (22%) and the remaining coagulase-negative staphylococci (16%). In the aetiological assessment of aortic aneurysm, clinical history and radiological imaging are essential. Unruptured degenerative aneurysm is usually asymptomatic and its risk factors are mainly older age, male sex, hypertension and smoking. These factors are shared for both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, although genetic (Marfan's disease), infectious or inflammatory factors are more frequent in the former. The most frequent location is infrarenal, and it is not associated with inflammatory findings on CT. Findings suggestive of aneurysm infection are: saccular or multilobulated aneurysm, inflammation of the periaortic tissue, presence of intramural air or in a periaortic collection or a perivascular collection. When these findings are present, we should think that an infection has occurred over a pre-existing degenerative aneurysm. Inflammatory aortic aneurysm is characterised by thickening of the adventitia presenting in CT an inflammatory ring greater than 1 cm around the aorta whose intensity may increase with intravenous contrast and extends to the retroperitoneum; retroperitoneal fibrosis may also appear, or adhesion of inflammatory tissue to structures ventral to the aorta (duodenum, ureters). Therefore, in the presence of any of these features, an aetiology other than degenerative should be considered.

Aortitis is the involvement of the aortic wall regardless of its cause. The clinical presentation is non-specific, with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, acute coronary syndrome or abdominal pain. Basically they are differentiated into two types: inflammatory (infectious and non-infectious) and non-inflammatory. Infectious causes include those caused by bacteria (Salmonella spp. and S. aureus, the most frequent, cause 40% of cases; Listeria, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium septicum and Campylobacter jejuni), tuberculosis, syphilis, or by viruses such as HIV. They usually affect an already injured segment with plaques of arteriosclerosis or an aneurysm and spread by contiguity or by septic emboli (in sepsis or infective endocarditis). Evolution During admission to the ICU, the patient was haemodynamically stabilised, orotracheal extubation was achieved and after three weeks of antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin, he was discharged to the cardiac surgery ward. On arrival, we were consulted to assess the duration of antibiotic treatment. When we carried out the first assessment, we found a patient in good general condition, afebrile, haemodynamically stable, breathing spontaneously without requiring oxygen therapy, with no sequelae after his stay in the ICU, and with no evidence of infection in the surgical wound, as well as normalisation of inflammatory analytical parameters. We reviewed the clinical history, and the patient reported back pain for two months, without interfering with his daily life, which subsided with paracetamol, until the day that a sudden pain appeared, for which he went to the emergency department. She had never had fever, shivering, weight loss or other symptoms. In the initial analysis there was no elevation of acute phase reactants and as there was no fever, there were no blood cultures prior to the post-surgical infectious complications. At this point a question arises, is S. lugdunensis really the cause of the ruptured aneurysm, or is it part of the 20% contaminant percentage? In any case, since the germ was isolated on sterile biological material, we decided to complete up to six weeks of antibiotic treatment with cefazolin 1 g daily i.v., given its efficacy and convenience of administration in haemodialysis patients.

Final diagnosis
Objectively, we were faced with a patient with a cardiovascular complication and a non-specific clinical presentation, suspected to be infectious according to the radiological and operative findings, but without fever, so we requested a serology for endocarditis with negative blood cultures.

The results obtained were as follows: Bartonella (Ig G and Ig M negative), syphilis (EIA) negative, Coxiella burnetii (Ig G phase I > 1:32768, Ig G phase II 1:32768, Ig M phase I weak positive, Ig M phase II negative). We requested amplification and detection of the bacterial DNA of the microorganism in blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was negative (performed at Centro de Referencia Instituto de Salud Carlos III de Majadahonda). Aortic tissue was not available for PCR or immunohistochemistry studies. The final result was: ruptured abdominal aneurysm with chronic infection due to Q fever.

Treatment was started with doxycycline (100 mg/12 hours) plus hydroxychloroquine adjusted to renal function (200 mg/12 hours) after confirming normality in the fundus examination. Cardiac surgery decided to postpone the intervention on the thoracic aneurysm in order to see the evolution of renal function and plan the most appropriate technique. Two months later, the patient died in another centre due to shock, without having undergone a CT scan or autopsy.
