Present illness
A 56-year-old patient attended the emergency department for 3 days of pain in the left scapula radiating to the precordial region, with pleuritic characteristics, accompanied by fever up to 37.8oC and a feeling of dystrophy. Consulted with his MAP who prescribed treatment with Paracetamol without clinical improvement, the patient reported progressive worsening with persistent fever and increased dyspnoea until minimal exertion. No cough or expectoration. No increase in orthopnoea or oedema. No other symptoms of interest.

Physical examination
BP 97/64 mmHg, HR 95 bpm, basal satO2 94%, T 37.2oC. Conscious and oriented in all 3 spheres, well hydrated and perfused, sweating, eupneic, cooperative, good skin and mucous membrane colouring. Head and neck: carotid pulses +, no IY or RHY, no goitre or adenopathy. AC: rhythmic without murmurs. PA: hypoventilation in the lower 2/3 of the left hemithorax, no wheezing. Abdomen: no significant alterations. MMII: no oedema, no evidence of phlebitis or DVT, pulses preserved.

- Chest X-ray
- Chest CT scan: no repletion defects in the main, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries. Bilateral pleural effusion, minimal on the right side and larger on the left side. Minimal pneumothorax in anterior segment of LSI and lingula. Small bilateral apical subpleural bullae. Bilateral residual apical pulmonary apical changes. Atelectasis of LII with air bronchogram suggestive of passive atelectasis due to the presence of effusion and the large hiatal hernia without being able to rule out pneumonic condensation. Two infracarinal adenopathies, one of 15 mm and the other calcified. Left hilar hilar adenopathy of 10 mm, which imprints on the bronchus of the lingula. Voluminous hiatal hernia.

Evolution
During his stay in the emergency department the patient remained hypotensive requiring fluid therapy and prostration without neurological focality. After haemodynamic stabilisation, the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine with a clinical diagnosis of sepsis of respiratory origin and CAP in LII, and antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin, azithromycin and clindamycin was started, as well as oxygen therapy and bronchodilators. Twenty-four hours after arriving on the ward, he presented with increased chest pain, sudden desaturation and haemodynamic instability, for which urgent radiological studies were requested, showing radiological worsening in the chest X-ray with the appearance of new hydro-aerial levels. The CT scan showed perforation of the left epiphrenic diverticulum with associated pleuro-mediastinitis and left hydrothorax secondary to the above, so diverticulectomy was performed by left thoracotomy with placement of an ostomy bag for subsequent closure of the oesophagocutaneous fistula. The patient had no complications in the immediate postoperative period, although he required a stay in the ICU for 5 days and vasoactive drugs during the first 24 hours after the operation. He completed antibiotic therapy with tigecycline and fluconazole with resolution of the associated septic symptoms. At discharge the patient was thermodynamically stable, a PEG carrier, good tolerance to liquids with little leakage of material through the fistula as shown in the GI transit images.

Clinical Judgement
- Perforated epiphrenic perforated oesophageal diverticulum, with associated pleuro- mediastinitis and septic shock.
- Left hydropneumothorax secondary to the above resolved.
- Right pleural effusion resolved

Treatment at discharge
-Maintain his previous usual treatment without changes -Regular treatment in the Thoracic Surgery Service -Control by his MAP
