We present the case of a 73-year-old male, with no known drug allergies, ex-smoker with a cumulative tobacco consumption of 106 packs/year and drinker of about 10 grams of ethanol per day, with a personal history of poorly controlled arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, persistent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with dabigatran and chronic anaemia since 2013 not studied. In addition, the patient had symptomatic chronic obliterating arteriopathy of the lower limbs (CLLM), for which he underwent surgery in 2006 and underwent aortobifemoral bypass with a Dacron graft. Since then, he has been under regular follow-up by Vascular Surgery. In 2014, the patient was evaluated in the Digestive Department for abdominal pain. Given the finding of a plastron in the cecum in the CT scan requested during the study, and with the suspicion of colorectal neoplasia, he underwent scheduled surgery and a right hemicolectomy was performed. The surgical specimen showed an ulcer in the cecum and the tumoural origin of the lesion was ruled out, although the aetiology of the perforation was not completely established. The episode was resolved after surgery and the postoperative period was uneventful.
In May 2017, during a routine Doppler ultrasound scan in vascular consultations, while the patient was asymptomatic, a previously absent dilatation of both distal anastomoses was observed, and a CT scan was requested to exclude bypass stenosis. In this context, and the requested CT scan had not yet been performed, the patient came to the emergency department in July 2017 due to asthenia and the appearance of progressive dyspnoea on moderate exertion lasting 24-36 hours, with no semiology of heart failure or respiratory infection. He described a previous picture of about 4 days' duration consisting of diffuse abdominal pain, with a colicky rhythm and unrelated to meals, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea without pathological products, diurnal and nocturnal. Afebrile at all times. He also reported an involuntary weight loss of 4-5 kg in recent weeks.

On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and haemodynamically stable. There was a slight cutaneous-mucosal pallor. Cardiac auscultation revealed a non-radiated systolic murmur II/VI in the apex, with no semiology of heart failure. The abdomen was soft, not painful on palpation, with no palpable masses or megaliths or signs of peritonism. No peripheral adenopathies were observed and the femoral and pedial pulses were preserved and symmetrical. The ED laboratory tests showed mild hyponatraemia, anaemia of 9.3 gr/dL similar to baseline and elevated acute phase reactants, with a C-reactive protein of 105 mg/L. No radiological studies were performed in the ED. The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for a study of the constitutional syndrome, requesting a study of anaemias and a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. Laboratory tests showed persistent elevation of acute phase reactants and anaemia with an iron-deficiency profile and Hb levels similar to those the patient usually presented, with the rest of the laboratory tests being anodyne. The CT scan showed a discrete dilatation of the common femoral arteries at the level of the anastomosis with the bypass, with a periprosthetic halo and a small liquid collection adjacent to the left common femoral artery of about 2 cm in diameter. There was no contrast leakage or other findings in the abdomen. After the CT scan, the patient was evaluated by an Infectious Diseases physician, who suspected a probable infectious complication of the aortobifemoral bypass.

Differential diagnosis
This is a patient with a radiological image compatible with a periprosthetic collection. The main options to evaluate would be, on the one hand, bypass infection; on the other, anastomotic dehiscence, less plausible since there was no contrast leakage and taking into account that this complication is more frequent in the first 3 months after surgery; or a collection of another adjacent origin, unlikely because no alterations of neighbouring organs were seen. Therefore, as a first option we considered infection of the vascular prosthesis. With this suspicion, endocarditis should be considered as a potential complication of this type of infection. In addition, the gastrointestinal symptoms should alert us to the possibility of enteric fistulisation of the periaortic lesion.

Evolution
As discussed, the possibility of infection of the vascular prosthesis was suspected. On examination, the left inguinal region showed no changes in colouring or other data suggestive of local inflammation. After discussing the case with Vascular Surgery and given that the CT scan showed the collection to be accessible, it was decided to perform an echo-Doppler scan in which the lesion could be seen, so an ultrasound-guided puncture-aspiration was performed at the bedside using sterile technique, yielding material with a macroscopic appearance that was clearly purulent. A sample was sent for culture and, as there was no evidence of haemodynamic instability/sepsis, it was decided to continue without antibiotherapy while awaiting the results of the urgent Gram stain and culture. Blood cultures (HC) were also taken without fever. The Gram stain showed no bacteria and the culture of the material obtained by puncture was negative. However, Enterococcus faecalis with basal phenotype grew in the HCs without fever in all (4/4) bottles. Following these results, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was requested to rule out the presence of infective endocarditis (IE) and it was decided to initiate antibiotic treatment with intravenous ampicillin, 2 grams every 4 hours, after extraction of new HC, where E. faecalis grew again in all 4 bottles.
The TTE described previously unknown moderate mitral regurgitation (although there were no previous echocardiographic studies), with preserved LVEF and no signs of IE. However, in the presence of E. faecalis bacteraemia and valvular heart disease, it was decided to perform transesophageal echocardiography, which was negative for endocarditis.
The patient remained afebrile throughout. Therefore, our suspicion was of an infection of the aortobifemoral bypass with secondary bacteraemia due to E. faecalis with no data of associated IE for the moment. At this point we wondered, on the one hand, what was the best antibiotic treatment strategy and, on the other, what attitude to take with respect to the bypass. With regard to antibiotic treatment, we decided to use a treatment schedule analogous to that of enterococcal IE, so we added iv ceftriaxone, 2 grams every 12 hours. With regard to the prosthesis, assuming it to be the primary focus of the infection, we initially considered the need to operate on the patient to remove the prosthesis and place an axillo-bifemoral bypass. At first, the patient refused surgery due to the risks of the technique, so it was agreed to perform a diagnostic-therapeutic arteriography of the LMII (left humeral route), with the intention of revascularisation of the iliac sector by means of angioplasty with an endoprosthesis. The arteriography showed a patent aortobifemoral bypass. However, after catheterisation of the native iliac artery, a critical lesion of the external iliac artery was detected and endovascular access to the bypass was not possible. At this point, the patient finally accepted the initially proposed surgery. It was therefore decided to schedule the surgery after completing 1 week of iv antibiotherapy and prior extraction of a control HC.
In the operating theatre, an aorto-enteric fistula was detected (from the 4th duodenal portion), and the aortobifemoral bypass was explanted, the duodenal suture was sutured and a double axillofemoral bypass was implanted with a ringed 8 mm gore prosthesis. Samples were sent to Microbiology for culture of the fluid from the periprosthetic collection and the explanted prosthetic material was also sent for culture. Both the preoperative control HC and intraoperative sample cultures were negative.
The postoperative period was favourable, with no fever and good peripheral revascularisation. The surgical wounds were free of complications. Thus, after 17 days of treatment with IV ampicillin and 10 days of treatment with ceftriaxone, it was decided to discharge the patient home to continue with amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours orally until completing 6 weeks of antibiotherapy.
The patient underwent regular check-ups by Vascular Surgery. One year after surgery, the evolution has been very favourable, with the patient remaining asymptomatic, with no symptoms of intermittent claudication and no data of complications of the new bypass. He continues to be followed up by Vascular Surgery.

Final diagnosis
Vascular prosthesis infection with secondary bacteraemia due to Enterococcus faecalis. Aorto-enteric fistula.
