42-year-old male former intravenous cocaine and heroin user, HIV and HCV co-infection with regular adherence to antiretroviral therapy. HCV genotype 3a treated with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir with response in controls at one and six months, without the patient attending subsequent controls. He presented several days of progressive oedematisation of the lower limbs, decreased diuresis and foamy urine, with no other symptoms. Physical examination revealed no other findings except unknown high blood pressure and oedema with pitting of the lower limbs. The patient acknowledges regular compliance with treatment and denies current drug use. Laboratory tests showed acute renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. Urine with proteinuria in the nephrotic range and haematuria with more than 100 dysmorphic red blood cells per field. Positive serology for HCV 3a with positive viral load (6.82log) compatible with recurrence. HIV viral load 3.53log. Other microbiological studies were negative. Positive cryoglobulins and decrease in C3 and C4, with negative remaining autoimmunity.
Antihypertensive, diuretic and glecaprevir-pribentasvir treatment was started. Renal biopsy revealed increased mesangial cellularity, thickening of the capillary walls with subendothelial deposits and duplicated areas of basement membrane, IFD with positive IgM, IgG, C1q and C3, all compatible with type I/III membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The patient's renal function subsequently worsened, with no response to corticoids, finally requiring the start of renal replacement therapy with haemodialysis.
