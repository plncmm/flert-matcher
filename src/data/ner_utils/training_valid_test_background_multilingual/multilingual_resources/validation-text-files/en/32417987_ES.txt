On 28 February 2020, a 54-year-old firefighter was admitted to the emergency department following a crisis characterised by clonic movements in the right arm and loss of consciousness. His relatives reported a sudden onset of rhythmic, involuntary movements in the right arm and hand, lasting 1-2 minutes, after which the patient became rigid and fainted. Upon awakening, he was disoriented for about 30 minutes. On admission to the emergency department, he reported conjunctivitis for the last 10 days and febrile fever for the last week. He had no neurological history, had been on ophthalmic steroid medication for the last few days, but was not taking any regular medication; there was no history of toxicity. Vital signs, peripheral blood oxygen saturation and ECG were normal (temperature 36.5 °C); neurological examination showed no focal deficits. Laboratory tests revealed neutrophilia (85.5%, reference values 40-75%), normal white blood cell count (6.38 × 1000/μL, reference values 4.0-10.0), lymphocytopenia (0.69 × 1000/μL, reference values 0.8-4.0), normal serum sodium (140.8 mmol/L, reference values 132.0-146.0), slightly high C-reactive protein (1.29 mg/dL, reference values 0-0.5) and high AST and ALT (57 and 59 IU/L respectively, reference values 2-40 and 4-49). Cranial CT scan did not give any relevant findings. A chest X-ray showed a single lingular disventilatory band. Urine cultures, urinalysis and uroantigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were normal. The patient's electroencephalogram, obtained the following day, showed no abnormalities. Suspecting Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, azithromycin was prescribed at a dose of 500 mg per day for three days. On 29 February, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of "first focus motor seizure"; no antiepileptic medication was prescribed. Four days later, on 4 March, the patient was again admitted to the emergency department with cough, high fever and dyspnoea; his daughter also had a high fever. His temperature was 38.5°C, pulse was 100 bpm and peripheral blood oxygen saturation was 94%. Laboratory tests showed increased markers of inflammation; chest X-ray showed bilateral perihilar mild consolidations; high-resolution CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. Based on epidemiological data and following governmental guidelines, two nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained, which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The patient was hospitalised in the intermediate care unit and placed on non-invasive ventilation. After two weeks on antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir), the patient recovered completely; he remains without evidence of crisis.
