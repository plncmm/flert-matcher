We present a black girl born in Equatorial Guinea and living in Spain with her adoptive parents since she was 6 years old. She had several episodes of urticaria and oedema of the extremities since several years before.

At the age of 8.3 years he travelled to Equatorial Guinea where he stayed for 2 weeks. Six months later, he consulted for a new urticarial rash on the inner thighs with intense pruritus. After treatment with oral antihistamines, the pruritus improved little and the rash remained unchanged. One month later, she began to experience occasional episodes of blurred vision and itching in the left eye. The patient's own family and later the ophthalmology department noticed a worm-like element in the patient's eye, approximately 1 cm in length, which was moving under the conjunctiva.

A haemogram showed slight eosinophilia (700/μl) and the presence of microfilariae was studied in direct preparations and after concentration (Knott technique) of peripheral blood taken at 12:00 h, and was negative. Serology against filaria by ELISA using a crude extract of adult parasite of Brugia malaya and Onchocerca volvulus (Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Majadahonda) as antigen showed the following pattern of antibodies: total IgG, IgG1 and IgG3: positive; IgG2 and IgG4: negative.

Given the suspected diagnosis of loiasis, she was treated with diethylcarbamazine at progressive doses for the first 3 days, and continued for 21 days of treatment, with the result that the rash and itching of the thighs disappeared and she no longer presented ocular symptoms. During the treatment she occasionally presented fever and general malaise.

Filariasis due to the nematode Loa loa is a parasitic disease endemic to Central and West Africa 1-5, where up to 13 million people may be infected.

The parasite is cylindrical, whitish, approximately 2-7 cm x 0.3-0.5 mm in size 1.6-9.

Infection is transmitted by bites of flies of the genus Chrysops; the inoculated larva, after maturing for about a year, will develop into an adult worm in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, through which it will migrate and may reach the ocular conjunctiva. In bisexual parasitism, the adult female worm releases microfilariae into the bloodstream which can be picked up by the vector in a new bite.

Loa loa causes chronic infection in humans, in whom it can live for more than 15 years, causing manifestations mainly due to hypersensitivity reactions to the adult worm. The main clinical manifestation is Calabar oedema (areas of angioedema, pruritic, mainly located on the extremities), and, less frequently, subconjunctival migration of the adult parasite.
