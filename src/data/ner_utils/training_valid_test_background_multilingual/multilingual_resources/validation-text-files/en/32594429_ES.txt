Delivery by emergency caesarean section at 33 weeks gestation, due to maternal complications. The child was born in poor health. He was intubated, surfactant and ventilated for 72 hours. He was then extubated and switched to high flow with humidification until the 5th day of life. On day 9 of life, his condition worsened, with poor food tolerance and respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation. A chest X-ray showed patchy consolidations of the right midline and perihilar region, indicative of infection. Blood test results revealed a slight increase in C-reactive protein to 14 mg/L (normal value < 10 mg/L) and increased thrombocyte count. Respiratory secretions were negative for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metaneumovirus and parainfluenza virus, but an RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive. The parents had no signs of illness indicative of COVID-19 during the previous 14 days and reported no contact with other COVID-19 suspects. The newborn was isolated and protected with the recommended personal protective equipment until subsequent smear tests for COVID were negative on day 12. A five-day course of i.v. antibiotics was established. The parents were asked to confine themselves for 14 days; they remained in good health during this time.
