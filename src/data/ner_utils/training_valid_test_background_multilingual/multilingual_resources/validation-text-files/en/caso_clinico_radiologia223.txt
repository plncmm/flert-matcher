A 37-year-old Asian male presented to the emergency department for syncope with spontaneous recovery and residual confusion. Cranial CT scan only identified a small right parietal subcortical subcortical hypodensity, without cortical involvement, suggestive of vasogenic oedema. On questioning the patient, he reported a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis two years ago in another centre, without microbiological isolation and with poor adherence to treatment. In view of the findings, an urgent MRI was performed, which identified a small rounded lesion with ring enhancement in the vasogenic oedema described, compatible with tuberculoma. It did not show diffusion restriction or signs of haemorrhage in magnetic susceptibility sequences. The suspicion was confirmed by biopsy of supraclavicular pathological adenopathy with a positive result for mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative.
