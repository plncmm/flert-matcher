A 24-month-old girl with recurrent episodes of evanescent generalised habonosis lesions and angioedema on the hands and face, resistant to conventional treatment (antihistamines and corticosteroids). No residual macules. No other symptoms. No apparent relationship with food or drugs. Examination revealed angioedema on the hands and wheals on the knees. The study performed was negative or normal for: Prick-test with food screening (cereals, nuts, legumes, fruits, cow's milk, eggs, meat, fish, shellfish, peach-LTP, latex and Anisakis), Prick-test with common pneumoallergens (pollens, fungi, mites and epithelia), blood and biochemistry tests (including complement study, liver profile, thyroid hormones, CRP, rheumatoid factor, parasites and immunoglobulins), and IgE against aeroallergens (aeroallergens). IgE against aeroallergens (olive, grasses, cat-dog epithelia) and food (milk-cow, egg, legumes, dried fruits, gluten and peach), serology against cytomegalovirus and EpsteinBar]. Fresh examination for parasites and Graham's tape: negative in 3 determinations. However, anti-transglutaminase, anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin IgA antibodies were positive. An HLA study associated with coeliac disease was requested, with positive results for haplotypes DR7-DQ2 and DR3-DQ2. In view of the results, a gluten-free diet was indicated. On review, there was evidence of clinical improvement, with isolated episodes of urticaria in 2 dietary transgressions. The patient was referred to the gastrointestinal tract for a biopsy. Chronic urticaria was diagnosed as the debut of coeliac disease.

We present a case of urticaria as the debut of coeliac disease without digestive symptoms, of interest because it is a rare association.
