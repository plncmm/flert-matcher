Anamnesis
A 63-year-old male patient presented with a non-painful lesion on palpation on the anterolateral aspect of the shaft of the penis of one month's duration. For the last couple of weeks he has reported daily, intermittent throbbing pain that wakes him up at night in the perineal and penile area. It partially subsides with paracetamol. Urination is preserved, with no urethrorrhagia.
The patient has been a carrier of the HIV virus for 10 years. On treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir, with less than 20 copies in the last control.
As other medical history of interest, he had an HCV infection receiving curative treatment with sustained viral response and ulcerative colitis on treatment with mesalazine.
ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY
As part of the follow-up programme for her ulcerative colitis, a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in June 2015 and revealed a tumour in the sigma whose pathological anatomy (PA) was compatible with intestinal adenocarcinoma.
A thoracoabdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing diffuse thickening of the walls of the sigma, with fatty changes in the submucosa indicating long-standing colitis. Loss of the fatty plane of separation of the sigma from the bladder dome is visualised, associated with a single lymphadenopathy in the mesosigm, which could be related to the sigmoid neoplasm.
No adenopathy or other metastatic or distant lesions were observed.
In August 2015, a left hemicolectomy was performed. The AP report of the surgical specimen reveals the presence of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 4.5 x 4 cm infiltrating the entire intestinal wall up to the meso with tumoural involvement of the surgical ring and 2 lymph node metastases, one of which is massive with capsular rupture (pT3N1b M0). Adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) was started in September 2015, receiving 12 cycles and ending in February 2016.
In December 2016, when the patient was asymptomatic, liver recurrence was found due to 2 metastatic lesions in segment VI of the right hepatic lobe, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
In February 2017, control CT scan showed complete necrosis of liver lesions with the appearance of a tumour in the left pararectal space and carcinoembryonic antigen values: 33.4 ng/ml (non-smokers 0-3 ng/ml. Smokers 0-5 ng/ml.) A biopsy was performed which confirmed recurrence. Native BRAF, NRAS and KRAS.
The pelvic recurrence was treated with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with capecitabine, irradiating the mesorectal bed and internal lymph node and iliac areas (50Gy).

Physical examination
Good general condition, performance status (PS) 0.
There is a stony, non-painful lesion on the right anterolateral aspect of the shaft of the penis. It extends to the glans penis, respecting the proximal level of the corpora cavernosa on palpation. There is also a mobile indurated nodule in the right inguinal region.

Additional tests
Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan with intravenous contrast showing new blastic lesions in both ischiopubic branches, together with a 3.5 cm lesion in the penis affecting the urethra and the corpus cavernosum on the right side.

Diagnosis
Penile metastasis of primary sigma.

Treatment
It was discussed in the tumour committee and first-line treatment with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan hydrochloride)-cetuximab was established.

Evolution
After the administration of two cycles of FOLFIRI-cetuximab, which he tolerated adequately, presenting mild symptoms of nausea and diarrhoea (G1), the patient reported a significant improvement in pain at the penile and perineal level and was in good general condition.
He is currently awaiting administration of the third cycle and evaluation of progress.
