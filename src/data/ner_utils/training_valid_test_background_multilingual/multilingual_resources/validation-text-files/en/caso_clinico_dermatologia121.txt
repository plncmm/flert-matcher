Anamnesis
A 29-year-old male, with no past history of interest, came to the emergency department of our centre because he had noticed a painless lesion on the glans penis for 3 days, as well as painful wounds in the perianal area. He denied the presence of fever, arthralgias, eye problems or other skin or mucosal lesions. He reported no history of dermatological or sexually transmitted diseases. The only noteworthy fact was that 1 month earlier he had had a full sexual intercourse without a condom with a woman who was not his regular partner.

Physical examination
Examination revealed the presence of a rounded, erythematous, erosive plaque, painless on palpation, with well-defined, slightly raised edges, on the dorsal side of the glans penis. On the right anal margin there were millimetre-sized punch-like erosions. No other cutaneomucosal lesions were observed.

Complementary examinations
A sample of his surface was taken for Treponema pallidum PCR, which was negative. Serologies for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as a sample of exudate from the perianal ulcers for herpes simplex virus PCR were all negative. However, one day after the initial visit, the patient developed dysuria and urethral discharge. A urethral swab was taken which showed the presence of leukocytes on Gram, and urine PCR was positive for Chlamyidia trachomatis.

Diagnosis
Circinate balanitis secondary to Chlamyidia trachomatis urethritis.

Treatment
Treatment with azithromycin 1 g v.o. in single dose was prescribed.

Evolution
The urethral symptomatology and perianal lesions resolved within days of treatment, while the penile plaque resolved in the following weeks without further treatment.
