Fuensanta 37 years old

- No toxic habits
- No known drug allergy
- Appendectomy at 28 years of age
- Various sutures for wounds
- Mild intermittent bronchial asthma. Treatment: Inhaled salbutamol on demand.
- Persistent allergic rhinitis treated with levocetirizine 5 mg c/24 hours.

 Reason for consultation
- One month before the consultation, the patient suddenly presented with dyspnoea, wheezing and ocular and pharyngeal pruritus. As the symptoms did not improve with the administration of salbutamol, she went to the emergency department of the Basic Health Area, where facial angioedema and bronchospasm were observed and subcutaneous adrenaline and hydrocortisone were administered parenterally.
- Prior to the episode, the patient had undergone endodontics. She was referred to the allergist to study a possible allergy to lidocaine (local anaesthetic used in endodontics).

Skin tests for various pneumoallergens common in the Region of Murcia: positive for mites.

Total IgE: 81 KU/ml (Normal: < 100 KU/L)
Specific IgE for Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus: 18,3 KU/L

- Skin tests (prick test and intradermal) with lidocaine: NEGATIVE
- Parenteral provocations with increasing doses of lidocaine: NEGATIVE.

- The anamnesis revealed that the patient was a regular consumer of snails, and that she sometimes wheezed after eating them.
- She recalled that she had eaten snails an hour earlier on the day of the attack that prompted the consultation.

- Skin test (prick test) with snail: POSITIVE (6x5 mm papule).

Specific IgE for snail meat: NEGATIVE
Shrimp tropomyosin recombinant specific IgE:
POSITIVE (5.4 KU/L)


DIAGNOSIS
- Rhinitis and asthma due to sensitisation to mites.
- Anaphylaxis due to snail sensitisation
- Mite-snail cross-sensitisation
- Tropomyosin sensitisation
