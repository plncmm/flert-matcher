Reason for consultation
18 year old patient, referred to the CAID in October 2008 for cannabis and cocaine use. He requests psychiatric assessment because for the last two years and under the effects of cannabis and/or stimulant use he has had several psychotic episodes. Personal somatic history No interest.

Family history
He is the youngest of two siblings. His older sister, aged 26, has studied advertising. No personal psychiatric history. Structured family with no relevant socio-economic problems. Personal history Born in Madrid. During pregnancy the mother reported no complications. The delivery was difficult with prolonged dilatation but without foetal distress. No complications during childhood, she lived until she was 7 years old in the southeast area of Madrid. School adaptation was good and she had a good performance. She moved to live in a village in the northwest of the Community of Madrid where she studied in a public school. Later, at secondary school, when he was 12-14 years old, he started using cannabis, at first sporadically with his group of friends, with a progressive increase in the dose. At that time, disciplinary problems began in class, with disrespect and impertinent behaviour without clear transgressions of the rules. He repeated 3rd year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO) and his performance began to drop. At the age of 15 he started using cannabis abusively and at the age of 16 he dropped out of school in the 3rd year of ESO. He is currently studying at the adult school for 3rd and 4th ESO. He was handing out advertisements and after two days he stopped because he did not like it. Since then he has not done any kind of work. He lives with his parents.

Psychiatric antecedents and toxic habits
Until he was 12-13 years old when he started using cannabis, the patient had no psychiatric history. From the age of 15 he has been abusing cannabis (approximately 10 joints/day) and episodically using cocaine and stimulants. Already at that time the parents report a clear change in his behaviour with difficulties in adapting to family and social norms which has led to increasing legal consequences over the last three years. At the present time, he has multiple criminal offences pending, such as theft of a vehicle when he was a minor, misdemeanours for threatening and insulting an officer of authority, offences for assaulting an officer of authority, offences for driving without a licence and offences of injury, public disorder and resistance to authority, as well as demonstrating permanent impulsivity with behavioural alterations and lack of concern for his own safety or the safety of others. In November 2006 (16 years old), he had his first psychiatric admission. Four days before admission, the patient began to behave in a distrustful manner, was excited, irritable, could hardly sleep and began to interpret attitudes and gestures of unknown people in a paranoid manner. All of this was precipitated by an event that had occurred a month before, the theft of some marijuana plants that he kept in the garage of his home.
He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (F12.5) in a context of cannabis abuse/dependence (F12.2). Since then he was under psychiatric follow-up, alternating phases in which he felt more nervous and excited, with others in which he felt dull and despondent without a clear relationship with the consumption of intoxicants. In January 2007 he went to a Therapeutic Community until July 2008, which he left voluntarily, with periods of abstinence during this period. In November 2007 (17 years old) he was admitted again. During the 3 to 4 weeks prior to admission, the patient was breaking any kind of rule, running away from home, being irritable, aggressive, sleeping little and losing 6 kg in approximately three months, in addition to not complying with treatment and using drugs (cannabis, cocaine, MDMA and "speed"). During admission, the patient was irritable and upset. He was emotionally out of control, with contained rage when referring to compliance with rules at home, and he was reaffirming his demand for drug use despite the negative consequences. He had initial problems adapting to compliance with the rules of admission to the unit, with a provocative and challenging attitude, although he finally integrated by participating in the unit's activities. He was diagnosed with cannabis abuse/dependence (F12.2), harmful use of cocaine (F14.1) and other recurrent affective mood disorders (F38.1). He was discharged on risperidone 3mg/day and clonazepam 1 mg/day. The patient maintained the pharmacological treatment until August 2008 (18 years old) when he was admitted to a clinic for 1 week. Two months before admission, the patient reported that he had abandoned pharmacological treatment and had continued to use cannabis and cocaine. The admission, which was carried out against his will, required mechanical restraint, solitary confinement and during the admission he displayed inappropriate and demanding behaviour. He was diagnosed with cannabis dependence (F12.2), multiple substance abuse (F14-15.1). Cannabis and cocaine induced psychotic disorder (F12-14.5) and antisocial personality disorder (F60.2) to be confirmed according to evolution.
In September of this year, he was transferred from hospital with the diagnosis of a psychotic episode. The relatives explain that after the previous hospital discharge, where he had been admitted with a diagnosis of toxic psychosis, they found the patient restless, he started using cocaine again and presented a picture of behavioural disorganisation. The patient was found lying on the floor of the house, crying, distressed, with disorganised and disjointed speech, with strange content "I bet on the Maghrebis and I have already insured several families". After being assessed in the emergency room, he was discharged with a diagnosis of resolved toxic psychosis and psychopathic personality traits. He argued with his parents over his refusal to take the treatment and give up drug use and went to live alone, feeling fine until the day of admission, when he returned with psychomotor restlessness, poorly structured delusional ideation of reference, prejudice and megalomania, little awareness of illness, as well as using MDMA, "speed", cocaine and cannabis. He was diagnosed with manic episode with psychotic symptoms (F31.2) and harmful use of cannabis (F12.1).

Current illness
He comes to the CAID accompanied by his father saying that this is his last chance. He does not really want to come but feels he has no choice. The patient reports that he is not ill and is not aware of any illness. He likes his life and finds drugs partly harmless. On the other hand, he is aware of some aspects of his personality, such as that he finds it difficult to trust others and is very prejudiced towards people, although, on the other hand, he considers himself cheerful and extroverted, but finds it difficult to obey orders and obey. He does not recognise authority figures. He has a multitude of legal cases, all of which are pending trial. He recognises that his personality changes under the effects of drugs but without any self-criticism about his actions and behaviour.

Psychopathological examination
Conscious and well oriented self and allopsychically. Discrete hypoproplexia. Cognitive functions preserved. Approachable and cooperative during the interview, although his speech was salty with loose associations and expansive with a clearly disinhibited behaviour. Dysphoric and expansive mood, showing excessive energy. Slightly irritable and distrustful. Ambivalent criticism of his lifestyle and drug use. No psychotic productivity or delusional ideation at present. No self- or heteroaggressive behaviour or self-harming ideation.
