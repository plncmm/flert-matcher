76 year old woman from the USA, black, COPD and rheumatoid arthritis on treatment with metrotexate (15mg/week). She was seen in the emergency department for syncope and desaturation, referring to a respiratory infection treated with levofloxacin. She had sinus tachycardia, with a baseline O2 saturation of 91%, afebrile and hypoventilation in the left base with scattered rhonchi. Complementary tests showed mild coagulopathy with D-dimer 3700. CRP and other RFA were normal. Angio-CT showed patchy opacities and areas of consolidation in the middle lobe and lingula (image 1). He ruled out PTE and was admitted with a diagnosis of bilobar pneumonia, starting piperacillin- tazobactam and levofloxacin. On the fifth day, after respiratory deterioration, he required OTI and admission to ICU. A PCR for influenza was requested and was positive, and oseltamivir was added. Given the poor evolution, despite optimal antibiotherapy, an intercurrent fungal process was suspected. New microbiological studies were requested; bacterial culture in BAS, BAL, galactomannan (GMN) in BAL and serum, PCR Pneumocystis jirovencii and mycoplasma pneumoniae. The result of GMN in BAL was > 6.5 and positive in blood. Culture showed hyphae compatible with Aspergillus fumigatus complex. Voriconazole iv was therefore started. The H1N1 PCR was persistently positive after 21 days of treatment and was replaced by Zanamivir, with rapid clearance of the virus by day 5. Resistance tests were negative. The clinical, respiratory and radiological evolution was good, with negative GMN after 3 weeks of antifungal treatment, which was prolonged for a further 6 weeks.
