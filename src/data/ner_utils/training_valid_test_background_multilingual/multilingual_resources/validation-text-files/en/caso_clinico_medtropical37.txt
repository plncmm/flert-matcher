This is a woman, aged 25 to 30 years, from the area between San Carlos, Quevedo and Quinsaloma, in the provinces of Los Rios and Bolivar, on a farm located in the tropical forest. He presented with total perforation of the nasal septum, large erythema extending to the edge of the wings of the nose. The ENT examination showed no lesions in other areas. Skin examination revealed an indelible scar on the right leg, 6 cm in diameter, from an ulceration she had 6 years ago, which had no aetiological diagnosis and healed with traditional treatment.
The smear examination, stained with Wright's stain, showed no amastigotes of Leishmania sp. and the leishmanin RDI measured 24 mm, so treatment was started with 20 ampoules of glucantime, 1 daily IM. Healing was achieved at the end of treatment and at the 4-month follow-up the internal foramen was observed but no signs of activity. The patient continues to live in the same place of origin.
