Reason for consultation: vomiting and arthromyalgia. Family history: of no interest. Personal history: No drug allergies. Diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, on treatment with weekly methotrexate and folic acid, and exceptionally with lornoxicam. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome, without follow-up or treatment.

Present illness
A 38-year-old patient attended the emergency department for 72 hours of general malaise, generalised arthromyalgia (predominantly in the lower limbs), pain in the lumbar spine radiating to the cervical level, with a sensation of cervical stiffness and paraesthesia in the hands and lower limbs, without alterations in strength. He was accompanied by vomiting (without blood, pus or pathological debris), which had increased in the last 24 hours to more than 10, with intolerance to ingestion. No headache or fever. No alterations in bowel habits or abdominal pain. Only a slight dry cough with whitish nasal mucus, no dyspnoea, and no other symptoms. In the neurological examination on admission, the meningeal signs were negative, with no nuchal rigidity. No alterations of the cranial nerves, tone, strength, sensitivity or reflexes were observed. No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia was observed. No language alterations, although they did describe an unsteady gait. The rest of the examination (PCA, abdomen and limbs) had no relevant data. She was then assessed by the on-call internist, who admitted the patient for examination, and prescribed treatment with methylprednisolone, enantyum and pantoprazole, without prescribing antiemetics because the vomiting was already scarce.

Complementary examinations
Laboratory tests in the ED: Haemogram: Hb 12.7g/dl. CBC 39.3%. Leukocytes 8,100/dl (PMN 73.9%, lymphocytes 23.1%). Platelets 340,000. Coagulation: Fibrinogen elevated, rest normal. Biochemistry: CRP 0.25. Renal function and ions normal. Liver enzymes, amylase, Bilirubin, and FA in normal limits. Imaging tests: Chest X-ray, abdomen, cervical and lumbar spine: no relevant data. ECG: Sinus rhythm at a good frequency, without repolarisation disorders.

Evolution
36 hours after admission, he began with severe generalised muscular weakness, dyspnoea, inability to swallow (which caused coughing and vomiting) and urinary incontinence. At that time, the examination revealed intolerance to supine decubitus, evident generalised muscular weakness (which made it impossible for him to move in bed), without eyelid ptosis, and a bladder balloon. His saturation was 99% and all other vitals were within normal limits. Laboratory tests showed hyponatraemia (Na 122 mEq/l) and hypokalaemia with no other data of interest. In a few hours, the patient evolved rapidly and developed acute respiratory failure, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The examination revealed medium pupils reactive to light, with direct and consensual photomotor activity preserved. Spontaneous vertical upward nystagmoid movements and palpebral flutter. Gag reflex abolished and cough reflex present. Universal hypotonia, flaccid, tetraplegia, universal areflexia and bilateral flexor CPR. As we syndromically found acute sensory-motor polyradiculoneuropathy, possible SIADH, and ventilatory insufficiency, it was decided to make the differential diagnosis with (see table). A non-contrast cranial CT scan was requested (without alterations), and subsequently a lumbar puncture was performed, requesting an extensive study of the CSF (urgent cytochemistry, ADA, GRAM, culture, VDRL, borrelia, CMV, VHS, VVZ, EBV, enterovirus, West Nile, JC, Toscana, mycobacteria culture, listeria, borrelia, chlamydia, coxiella, mycoplasma, anti GAG, anti NMDA, anti potassium channels, anti ganglioside, Tropheryma whipplei PCR and smear microscopy. The study was completed with requests for:
- In blood: ANA, antiDNA Ac, ENAs, ANCAs, ECA, antiganglioside Ac, onconeuronal Ac, anti acetylcholine receptor, anti musk, Serologies of lues, borrelia, brucella, HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, campylobacter jejuni, legionella, ch. psittaci and pneumoniae, coxiella burnetii, mycoplasma pneumoniae, rickettsia conori, clostridium botulinum, HBV, HCV and HIV, total porphyrins, Vit B12, folic acid, iron metabolism, ESR, thyroid hormones, lipid profile, proteinogram and immunoglobulins, CPK, aldolase, alpha-1-antitrypsin and anti IA2.
- In urine: heavy metals in urine (mercury, lead and arsenic), total porphyrins in urine.
- CSF biochemistry showed albumin-cytological dissociation (clear, colourless fluid. Leukocytes 7, mononuclear 100%, red blood cells 15 with spiculated appearance, glucose 55mg/dl, protein 125.7mg/dl, ADA 3.8 U/L), and treatment was started with intravenous immunoglobulins for 5 days.

Subsequently, contrast-enhanced MRI was performed (without alterations) and ENG/EMG reported as signs of sensory-motor polyneuropathy, predominantly sensory, axonal and demyelinating with predominant involvement of the most distal region of the upper and lower limbs. The lesion was of moderate degree, which does not fit the typical pattern of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. The results of the other blood, CSF and urine tests were negative or within normal limits, except for Tropheryma Whipple PCR in CSF, which was positive. Following the findings described above, Whipple's disease was diagnosed with neurological symptoms as a form of presentation, in addition to joint involvement. Treatment was started with intravenous ceftriaxone.
