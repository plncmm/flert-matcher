A 42-year-old man, diagnosed with HIV infection eight years previously, with regular immunological controls, without criteria for starting antiretroviral treatment. He had a history of cutaneous leishmaniasis on the right forearm 20 years earlier, when he lived in Madre de Dios (eastern Amazon, Peru). He reported that he had received incomplete treatment, which he could not specify. He had also undergone surgery for a cholesteatoma of the right ear 10 years earlier, with right peripheral facial paralysis as a sequel. He had no history of other diseases.

He had annual clinical controls of viral load (VL) and CD4 T-lymphocyte levels, which remained stable (VL < 20,000 copies/ml and CD4 > 700 cells/mm3), until the last three months showed a slight decrease in CD4 to 643 (28%) cells/mm3 and a significant increase in VL to 47,466 copies/ml. During this period he had intercurrent episodes of self-limited diarrhoea and coryza. He also had positive markers for hepatitis B: HBsAg and total anticore, without alterations in liver function tests.

She attended the Infectious Diseases Department for a check-up, reporting parietal headache and persistent nasal congestion, with no lesions on nasopharyngeal examination. One month later, she presented epistaxis, mucopurulent nasal discharge and a tumour was observed in the right nostril (ala nasalis).

Examination revealed papulo-ulcerative lesions of approximately 0.5 cm in diameter in the vestibular and mucosal region of the right nostril, presence of mucopurulent discharge and an exophytic mass. A biopsy of the nasal tumour was performed for study.

On physical examination there was also a depressed, thin, smooth, hypopigmented, irregular-edged, depressed scar 2 cm in diameter on the right forearm, corresponding to an old lesion of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with zidovudine, lamivudine, lopinavir and ritonavir was started due to the onset of symptoms and suspicion of HIV-related neoplasia.

Histological examination showed oval structures, 2-4 Î¼m in diameter, of uniform size, with a peripheral kinetoplast, located in the cytoplasm of the histiocytes, compatible with amastigotes of Leishmania spp. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) (with total antigen for L. boliviana and L. brasiliensis) detected anti-Leishmania antibodies at a dilution of 1/80, confirming the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. One month after starting HAART, he started treatment with sodium stibogluconate, 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days.

After completing the treatment with sodium stibogluconate, the evolution was favourable and the lesion improved between two and four weeks, until complete healing. Three months later, CD4 values rose to 843 cells/ml and viral load decreased to < 40 copies/ml. He is currently asymptomatic, on HAART, with no relapse of the lesion or similar lesions.
