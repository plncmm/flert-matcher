A 56-year-old male farmer from Tarapoto, San Martin Region, Peru. He consulted for pain in the ventral aspect of the wrist for eight years. He reported pruritus and stabbing pain. He had been self-medicating with sulphur creams without visible improvement, presenting scarring in the oldest part of the lesion. Chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi: Erythematous-squamous lesion; brown muriform cells with central septum (400x magnification); blackish colony at 10 days incubation on Sabouraud agar; septate hyphae with elliptical conidia (400x magnification).

Direct examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) showed the presence of brown muriform or fumagoid cells with central septum typical of chromoblastomycosis. In culture, 7 mm colonies developed after 10 days, slow-growing, hairy, limited and black in colour, compatible with a dematiaceous fungus. Subsequent study, using the microculture technique and interrupted Ziehl-Neelsen staining for characterisation of hyphae and conidia, allowed identification of the fungus F. pedrosoi.

Complementary laboratory tests showed negative HIV serology, haematocrit 45%, haemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, leucocyte count 7,800 cells/mm3 and eosinophilia (12%, 936 cells/mm3).

He started antifungal treatment with itraconazole 100 mg every 12 h for one month; however, the patient did not return for follow-up and abandoned the medical treatment, losing the possibility of observing the clinical course.
