HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Male, 67 years old, retired. Active and independent life.


PERSONAL HISTORY
No known drug allergies. Cardiovascular risk factors: ex-smoker of 30 pack-years. Arterial hypertension under treatment for years. Dyslipidaemia under dietary treatment.  Cardiological history At the age of 65 he was referred to an outpatient clinic for an asymptomatic systolic murmur in the mitral focus. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed (2016) showing preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and moderate mitral insufficiency, with no other relevant findings. Outpatient follow-up is scheduled.
Other medical history of interest Severe sleep apnoea syndrome with use of CPAP since 2012. Chronic gastritis and hiatal hernia. Depressive syndrome in 2016 resolved. Associated somatoform disorders. Left vocal cord paralysis after prolonged orotracheal intubation for viral pneumonia in 2016. Recent diagnosis of localised prostate neoplasia without distant extension pending prostate resection surgery. Chronic medication Escitalopram 10 mg (1 tablet at breakfast); aliskiren/HTZ 300/12.5 mg (1 tablet at breakfast).

CURRENT ILLNESS
He was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital by the mobile ICU after out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, which was recovered in less than ten minutes with basic cardiac resuscitation manoeuvres (CPR) and a semi-automatic external defibrillator (AED) shock when the rhythm was interpreted as shockable. After regaining spontaneous circulation in sinus rhythm, the patient persisted with a low level of consciousness, requiring intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation by the mobile ICU. The event took place in the street, with no close relatives as witnesses. Subsequently, the patient had no memory of what had happened at that moment (lacunar amnesia) and reported having been asymptomatic in the previous days.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
On arrival he was afebrile, with heart rate (HR) 82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 155/83 mmHg and SatO2 100% with orotracheal intubation, connected to mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50%. Carotid auscultation without murmurs. Jugular venous pressure normal. Rhythmic cardiac auscultation with a striking holosystolic murmur in the mitral focus radiating to the axilla (similar to that described in previous cardiology examinations). Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur. Abdominal examination with no pathological findings. Good distal perfusion, without oedema. Central and distal pulses present.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Laboratory: biochemistry: glucose 260 mg/dl, creatinine 1.26 mg/dl, urea 36 mg/dl, normal ions, troponin T US 18 ng/l and at 3 hours 32 ng/l (reference value 14 ng/l) and CK 107 U/l. Haemogram: Hb 15.6 g/dl, leucocytes and platelets normal. Coagulation: PT 109%, TTPa and D-Dimer in normal range. Toxins: ethanol not detectable, other toxins in urine negative. Arterial blood gases: pH 7.2, pCO2 65 mmHg, pO2 163 mmHg, bicarbonate 21.3 mmol/l. Portable chest X-ray: cardiomegaly in anteroposterior projection. Endotracheal tube properly positioned. No evidence of pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm. Normal PR. Left axis. Left anterior hemiblock. Narrow QRS. ST-segment depression of approximately 1 mm in V4-V6 and flattened T wave in aVL. Urgent cranial CT scan: no evidence of acute intracranial pathology. Normal perfusion map and normal supra-aortic trunks. Emergency echocardioscopy: poor echocardiographic window. Left ventricle (LV) of normal size and slightly hypertrophic. LVEF moderately affected by global hypokinesia with zone of thinning and hypocontractility in the inferoposterior basal segment. Normal right ventricle (RV). Mitral insufficiency at least moderately very eccentric (ischaemic versus prolapsed). Normal aortic and tricuspid valves. No pericardial effusion. Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries with minimal irregularities, without significant stenosis. Regulated transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved LVEF. Posterobasal and inferobasal akinesia. Normal RV. Mitral insufficiency at least moderate (probably severe) with posterior leaflet prolapse. Rest normal. Transesophageal echocardiogram: confirms severe mitral insufficiency due to posterior leaflet prolapse predominantly at P2, with eccentric jet directed anteriorly with Coanda effect. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): mitral prolapse with associated severe mitral insufficiency. Dilated LV (VTD 120 ml/m2). Thinning and hypocontractility of the basal and mid-inferolateral segments, with late intramyocardial enhancement in the basal inferolateral segment. RV of normal size and function.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
The patient's evolution was good during his stay in the ICU, and he was extubated after 24 hours and transferred to the hospital ward stable and asymptomatic. A broad differential diagnosis of cardiorespiratory arrest had already begun in the ED. The complementary tests described above were performed, leading to a diagnosis of malignant mitral prolapse as the cause of the event. During his hospitalisation he presented several bouts of non-sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (with superior axis and right bundle branch block morphology). In view of the severe mitral insufficiency with LV dilatation confirmed by MRI, it was decided in a medical-surgical session to perform mitral valve repair, which took place on admission, with implantation of two 4/0 Goretex neochords at P2 and AM (Physio 30 mm) plus a 30 mm mitral ring, without complications. Subsequently, an automatic defibrillator was implanted for secondary prevention. Clinical evolution was satisfactory and he was discharged with the following medication: torasemide 10 mg, ramipril 2.5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, ferrimanitol ovalbumin 40 mg, metamizol 575 mg and tramadol 100 mg; and follow-up in cardiology outpatient clinics.

DIAGNOSIS
Malignant mitral valve prolapse.
Resuscitated cardiorespiratory arrest, in defibrillable rhythm. Severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral prolapse.
Left ventricular dilatation.
Non-sustained monoform ventricular tachycardias.
