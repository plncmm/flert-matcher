A 61 year old patient came to the emergency department of our hospital with fever of 48 hours evolution. He reported a recent dental extraction with adequate antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient had a mechanical aortic and mitral prosthesis following Salmonella endocarditis at the age of 35, diagnosed after ischaemic stroke of the left middle cerebral artery as the first manifestation, with residual haemiparesis and dysarthria. Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests showed C-reactive protein of 8.3, with the rest of the data being normal. Initially, blood cultures were taken, which were negative, and empirical antibiotic therapy was administered due to the high suspicion of late infective endocarditis on the prosthetic valve.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, showing two mitral periprosthetic leaks and moderate mitral insufficiency, not present in previous echocardiograms.
Given the persistence of fever and the negative results of the first two rounds of blood cultures, the possibility of microorganisms causing endocarditis with negative blood cultures was considered, with positive PCR for Coxiella Burnetii and IgG phase I (chronic) at a titre of 1/3200. A PET-CT scan was performed, which showed no evidence of valvular or other levels of uptake.
Empirical intravenous treatment with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine was therefore started. After 48 hours the fever subsided and mitral valve replacement surgery was scheduled, which was successfully performed, after which the removed valve was sent to the laboratory, and the PCR on prosthetic material was positive for Coxiella Burnetii.
