Anamnesis
A 44-year-old male patient from Algeria, with no known drug allergies and a personal history of episodes of bronchial hyperresponsiveness occasionally treated with salbutamol. Tobacco smoker (16 packs/year) and smoker of cannabis and hashish. He has lived in Spain for 15 years and all his relatives live abroad.

The patient consulted the emergency department on several occasions (May 2014) for one month of symptoms characterised by episodes of predominantly facial and periocular oedema, classified as angioedema. He was treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines, without improvement. He also reported generalised weakness with myalgia, anorexia with a weight loss of 10 kg, high dysphagia and cough with persistent mucous expectoration.

Physical examination
The findings include proximal muscle weakness, non-painful hepatosplenomegaly, palpebral erythema in heliotrope, swelling of the left arm, Gottron papules with periungual telangiectasias and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Nasal fibroscopy revealed a nodular lesion in the right hemicavum, slightly more than 1 cm in diameter, behind and below the impeller. No cervical lymphadenopathy was observed.

Complementary tests
"General laboratory tests: lymphopenia, AST 713 IU/l, ALT 281 IU/l, LDH 2,505 IU/l, CK 27,000 IU/l.
"Immunological study: positive ANA (1/160), positive anti-SSA (RO), negative levels of circulating anti-dsDNA, anti-Jo1 and anti-Mi2 antibodies, negative alpha-1 antitrypsin. Negative tumour markers.
"EMG: myopathic pattern.
"Muscle biopsy: immune-mediated myopathy of the dermatomyositis type.
"Thoracic CT scan: significant emphysema of bibasal predominance with formation of large bullae, ruling out alpha-antitrypsin deficiency. Left apical cavitated thin-walled lesion. Images with tree-in-bud in the apical part of the right lower lobe.
"Thoracoabdominopelvic CT: no evidence of neoformative pathology. Progression of right thoracic tree-in-bud areas and appearance of biapical cavitated lesions, suspicious of TB reactivation.
"Normal fibrobronchoscopy.
"IGRA: negative. Lowenstein and Ziehl-Nielsen negative.
"Bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS): positive for Haemophilus influenzae.
"18-F-PET-CT: focal hypermetabolic FDG deposition in the right parietal region over the temporal lobe. Nasal fibroscopy with excisional biopsy with positive pathology for poorly differentiated carcinoma.
"Cranial MRI: nodular lesion in the right hemicavum suggestive of primary tumour lesion.

Diagnosis
Poorly differentiated carcinoma of the right hemicavum, cT1N0M0 (stage I), with dermatomyositis as paraneoplastic syndrome.

Treatment
Given the suspicion of dermatomyositis (DM), a muscle biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment was started with corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day) and subsequently, given the poor clinical improvement, with immunoglobulins (0.4 mg/kg/day) for 5 consecutive days every 28 days, and then the dose was increased to 1 g/kg/day for 3 days. Given the persistence of severe weakness, muscle rehabilitation was requested. He also presented progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, which made it necessary to place a nasogastric feeding tube to avoid bronchoaspiration. Given the patient's intolerance to the tube, it was decided to place a percutaneous gastrostomy to continue enteral nutrition.
A thoracic CT scan was performed, which showed a cavitated lesion suspicious of tuberculosis (TB). Fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS) was requested, which was negative for mycobacteria and positive for Haemophilus influenzae, and the patient was treated according to the antibiogram. The control CT scan ruled out an interstitial pattern associated with dermatomyositis, but there were signs of reactivation of cavitated lesions suggestive of active TB, so tuberculostatic treatment was started with four drugs (rifampicin, pyrazinamide, isoniazid and ethambutol).

The case was assessed by the multidisciplinary committee of the otorhinolaryngology section, and was considered to be a candidate for chemoradiotherapy (QT-RDT) with radical intent given the association of dermatomyositis as a paraneoplastic syndrome.

He was transferred to the oncology department to start oncospecific treatment. The patient underwent concomitant QT-RDT with radical intent, CDDP 100 mg/m2 every 21 days and 3D intensity-modulated external radiotherapy (IMRT) on the tumour bed and cervical chains in 33 fractions (total dose 69.96 Gy). Subsequently, he is a candidate for adjuvant Al-Sarraf chemotherapy for three cycles. The first cycle of CDDP 80% QT was administered due to hypoalbuminaemia and anaemia.
Given the social context, it was decided to transfer him to the socio-health centre for convalescence and to continue with rehabilitation.

Evolution
The patient completed treatment with QT-RDT in February 2015, with mild side effects such as epithelitis and grade 2 mucositis. He presented progressive improvement in dysphagia, currently tolerating a triturated diet with persistent propulsion defect.
