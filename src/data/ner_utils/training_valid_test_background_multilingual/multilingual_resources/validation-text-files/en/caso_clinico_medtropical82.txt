A 36-year-old woman from Los Ralos, Tucumán, in the northwestern province of Argentina, with a history of HIV infection since 2002, without antiretroviral therapy (ART) or controls for her disease, hepatitis C and chronic Chagas disease, the latter diagnosed by three positive serological tests (ELISA, indirect haemagglutination (HAI) and immunofluorescence (IFI). The patient was admitted to the Hospital de Enfermedades Infecciosas Francisco J. Muñiz in the city of Buenos Aires for acute convulsive syndrome. Physical examination revealed left brachio-crural and right central facial paresis, ataxia, dysmetria and nystagmus.

Laboratory tests on admission included a haematocrit of 40.2%, haemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, leukocytes 3,200/mm3, platelets 155,000/mm3, HSV 40 mm/h, GOT 187 U/l, GPT 97 U/l, normal coagulation tests, VDRL, HBsAg and anti-HBc non-reactive, viral load for HCV 14,279,000 copies (7.16 log). CD4+ LT count was 79 cells/μL3 (8%). Chest X-ray, ECG and echocardiogram were normal.

Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain showed a large area of hyperintense pathological signal in FLAIR, T2 and diffusion with discrete mass effect and some heterogeneous enhancement sectors after contrast injection in the cortico-subcortical projection entering the cerebellar peduncles on the right side and extending to the brainstem and images with similar signal behaviour but without mass effect or enhancement with contrast in the lateral frontal frontal cortico-subcortical projection predominantly on the left. Axial T1 Flair MRI with gadolinium: heterogeneous nodular formations enhancing with intravenous contrast in the right posterior fossa and left lateral frontal lobe.

A lumbar puncture was performed with an opening pressure of 12 cm H2O, obtaining a clear, colourless CSF, protein 0.47 mg/dl, glucose 78 mg/dl, 11 cells/mm3 (100% mononuclear) with a direct examination and negative bacteriological, mycological and mycobacterial cultures. Molecular testing (PCR) for HSV-1 and 2, VZV, CMV, HHV-6 and EBV was negative. Strout's microhaematocrit was performed twice, with no parasites observed.

Serology for toxoplasmosis was positive (IgG positive 1/64 and IgM negative by IFA), so empirical treatment was started as cerebral toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine at usual doses.

The patient presented clinical progression of cerebellar syndrome after two weeks of treatment, so treatment with benznidazole 300 mg per day was added on the presumption of a probable reactivation of a Chagas infection. A PCR for Chagas in plasma and CSF was performed, and the plasma sample was positive.

The patient progressed with an improvement in the clinical picture and in the lesions observed on imaging. A brain MRI with contrast was performed 35 days after starting antichagasic treatment, which showed a significant reduction in the lesions, leading to hospital discharge and outpatient follow-up. Fifteen days after treatment with benznidazole, he developed platelets and increased hepatic transaminases, for which he continued treatment with nifurtimox 240 mg daily. Eleven days after the latter treatment, she developed peripheral neuropathy and benznidazole was reinstituted. The patient did not comply with clinical controls, and one week after starting benznidazole treatment again, she was admitted to hospital for fever and pancytopenia. She presented a clinical picture of multi-organ failure of presumed septic aetiology and died 24 hours after admission.
