A 46 year old woman with no previous history, who came to the emergency department reporting micturition complaints of 10 days' duration, having received two cycles of monotherapy with fosfomycin 1g with little improvement. In the last two days, he began to suffer from fever with bacteraemic characteristics and severe general malaise, also associated with pain in the right renal fossa, for which he consulted. Initial examination: BP 98/55 mmHg, To 37.7oC, right fist percussion dubiously positive, the rest was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were carried out: GOT 90 U/L, GPT 73 U/L, CRP 226 mg/L, PCT 0.13 ng/ml, with the rest of the biochemical, haemocyte and coagulation parameters being normal. Given the suspicion of probable acute pyelonephritis, a urinary sediment was requested with no alterations and an ultrasound scan of the kidney and urinary tract with no data to support the suspected diagnosis.
Empirical therapy was started with Ertapenem in the face of the patient's failure after collecting blood and urine cultures. No improvement, adding to the initial symptoms intense pain in the right hypochondrium showing a positive Murphy and great defence at abdominal level. An abdominal CT scan was requested, ruling out surgical pathology, although it showed the following findings: ̈Hepatomegaly with some heterogeneity of the parenchyma and periportal oedema compatible with perihepatitis, which could be related to a possible hidden liver disease ̈.
A serological study was requested, including HIV, syphilis, HBV and HCV, negative; HSV2 IgM+/ IgG-. After receiving these results, the patient was re-interviewed, stating the history of risky sexual relations and the emission of minimal vaginal exudate associated with the initial symptoms referred to, all compatible with probable vulvovaginitis. Empirical therapy was started with ceftriaxone and doxycycline and the results were negative for the presence of Chlamydia Trachomatis, Neisseria and Trichomonas. However, the patient improved markedly after starting this therapy.
