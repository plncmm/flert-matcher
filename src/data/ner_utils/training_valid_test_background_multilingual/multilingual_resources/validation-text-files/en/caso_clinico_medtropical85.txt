We report the case of a 41 year old male patient from Argelia, Cauca, current resident of Agua de Dios Cundinamarca (albergue Boyacá).

His first representative symptoms began in his second decade of life due to long-standing skin lesions that did not respond to multiple topical treatments. Skin lesions related to plaques and erythematous papules that generated a sensation of hypoaesthesia, alopecia and anhidrosis in the extremities and trunk, as well as papules that evolved into generalised nodules. She also presented pain in the bilateral ulnar nerve trunk. The patient did not consult at the time.

At 34 years of age she presented worsening of her clinical condition with madarosis, absence of eyelashes, sero-bloody rhinorrhoea followed by constant epiphora, skin lesions that increased in number and extension. In the upper and lower extremities, sensory alterations with no uptake of pain stimuli, loss of strength in the hands, osteoarticular deformities.

First-line family history of Hansen's disease (mother), who received dapsone monotherapy, maintained close cohabitation prior to treatment, currently mother with data of death due to unrelated pathology.

He was assessed for the first time at the Sanatorio Agua de Dios Cundinamarca. Physical examination revealed leonine facies, diffuse scar lesions with hyperchromic characteristics, madarosis, absence of eyelashes, no alteration in the anterior chamber of the eyeball, perforation of the septum with collapse of the nasal dorsum, pinna with multiple euchromic nodules with elongation of the earlobes. Dermatoneurological lesions on extremities and trunk consisting of multiple diffuse nodules with regular borders, some erythematous plaques without anhidrosis and without alopecia, thickening of radial and median ulnar nerve trunk not painful on palpation with related sensory-motor disturbances; in the hands, bone resorption with preservation of the nail bed, claw hands with loss of strength with little gravity overcoming and without overcoming resistance, tenar and hypothenar amyotrophy, scarred areas due to previous burns. On the face: madarosis, multiple residual atrophic hyperpigmented scars, saddle nose, collapsed nasal pyramid; C. Auric pavilions: multiple papules and euchromatic nodules, firm and infiltrated with a keloid appearance. Multiple lepromas, scar sequelae due to sensory alteration, involvement of the radial and median ulnar nerve - pendulous hand - claw hand.

A presumptive diagnosis of leprosy was made towards the lepromatous pole on clinical grounds and confirmatory paraclinical tests were indicated:

1. Bacilloscopy of nasal mucus and interstitial fluid with report of data with Colombian semi-quantitative scale.

- Initial bacilloscopy with bacillary index (IB) of 2.2 without morphology studies, confirming the bacteriological diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy.

2. Skin biopsy with incisional technique.

- Histopathology: it reported thinned orthokeratotic epidermis separated by a wide collagenous band of diffuse dermal infiltrate, extensive, consisting of spindle cells embedded in dense collagen with some macrophages with vacuolated cytoplasm. Fite-Faraco staining shows some bacilli and granular forms. No nerves are seen. Conclusive diagnosis of histioid lepromatous leprosy. Treatment was started with adult multibacillary PQT (ri-fampicin 600 mg once a month, dapsone 100 mg daily and clofazimine 300 mg once a month and 50 mg daily) for 24 months without interruption as established by the WHO at that time, with supervision of medicines supplied at the Boyacá hostel. After 24 months, patient with no clinical improvement, persistence and increase of skin lesions, poly-neuropathy with increasing sensory-motor impairment. Bacteriological controls with evidence of increased bacillary index and morphological viability test with high percentage of solid bacilli.

- At six months on treatment with PQT MB adult IB of 2.6 with morphological study with 90% solid and 10% fragmented.

- At 11 months on treatment with PQT MB adult with IB: 0.4.

- At 24 months on treatment with PQT MB adult MB according to epochal scheme for 24 months with IB: 2.4. Given the worsening of dermato-neurological clinical manifestations and bacteriological association with bacillary viability, resistance studies were initiated.

3. Resistance studies, genotypic sensitivity test for Mycobacterium leprae, Genotype Leprae-DR method. Molecular genetic identification of the rpoB, gyrA and folpi genes and their mutations. bacillary index evaluated 1.3; notification is obtained reporting no DNA amplification from the processed sample, the test requires a bacillary index greater than 2.5.
