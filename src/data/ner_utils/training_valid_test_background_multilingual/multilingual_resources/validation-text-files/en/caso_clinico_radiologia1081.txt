A 59-year-old male patient with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) 10 years earlier consulted for cognitive deterioration. He underwent open MRI (Philips Outlook 0.23T), with FSE T2 and FLAIR sequences, showing small bifrontal subcortical hyperintense areas, left cortico-subcortical and right frontal cortical, which were interpreted as lesions with a vascular aspect. In the FLAIR sequence, cortical hyperintensity was identified in the temporal lobe and in the pre- and post-central gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, left occipital cortex and right inferior temporal gyrus, amygdala and left hippocampus, with no such alterations being observed in FSE T2 sequences.

Axial FLAIR. Cortical hyperintensity in temporal lobe and left hippocampus. Hyperintensity in right inferior temporal gyrus.

Axial FSE T2. No alterations are observed.

After 15 days, the patient began with visual disturbances and a rapidly progressive cognitive deterioration; 5 days later it was decided to hospitalise him. The patient added pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, seizures, myoclonias, speech disturbances, reaching a picture of aphasia, and starting also with sphincter incontinence. The electroencephalogram showed a slow rhythm.
A possible diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jacob was suggested.
A new high-field MRI was performed (GE Horizon LX Signa 1.5 T), adding diffusion images to the conventional sequences. The FSE T2 and FLAIR sequences showed the same lesions visualised in the previous examination. The FLAIR sequence showed cortical hyperintensity with greater involvement of the left hemisphere, temporal cortex and hippocampus, occipital cortex, left paracentral insula, hyperintensity in frontal, anterior cingulate and bilateral parietal cortex greater than left and in right inferior temporal gyrus cortex. The FSE T2 sequence showed slight hyperintensity in an ill-defined manner.

Axial FLAIR. Cortical hyperintensity in left pre- and post-central gyrus, bilateral superior parietal and frontal and left paracentral.

Axial FSE T2. Mild cortical hyperintensity in left pre- and post-central gyrus, bilateral superior parietal and frontal gyri and left paracentral gyrus.

Bilateral cortical lesions were more clearly identified in the diffusion sequence.

Diffusion. Marked cortical hyperintensity in left pre- and postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior parietal and frontal and left paracentral.

In FLAIR, slight hyperintensity was observed in the head of both caudate nuclei, more evident in the diffusion sequence, being less significant in FSE T2.

Axial FLAIR. Cortical and head hyperintensity in both caudate nuclei.

Diffusion. Marked cortical hyperintensity and in the head of both caudate nuclei.

Axial FSE T2. Mild cortical hyperintensity and in the head of both caudate nuclei.

Over the course of 20 days the patient's electroencephalogram changed to a biphasic and triphasic spike-wave pattern, with no reversal of his clinical condition. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for 14-3-3 proteins. The patient was considered to have a probable diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease [progressive dementia and at least 2 of 4 clinical features (myoclonus, visual or cerebellar signs, pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs, akinetic mutism) and EEG alterations].
Another MRI was performed, showing more significant bilateral cortical lesions, both in FLAIR, diffusion and FSE T2 sequences, adding greater hyperintensity in the head and body of the caudate nucleus bilaterally, and both putamen.

Axial FLAIR. Diffuse cortical hyperintensity in the head of both caudate nuclei and both putamen.

Diffusion. Marked diffuse cortical hyperintensity in the head of both caudate nuclei and both putamen.

Axial FSE T2. Hyperintensity in head of caudate nuclei and putamen and slight diffuse cortical hyperintensity.

One month later, the patient underwent a fourth MRI, showing a further increase in bilateral cortical hyperintensity in both caudate nuclei and both putamen in FSE T2, FLAIR and diffusion sequences. The T1 sequence showed hyperintensity in both putamen.

Axial FSE T2. Hyperintensity in head of caudate nuclei and putamen and moderate diffuse cortical hyperintensity.

Axial FLAIR. Marked cortical hyperintensity in caudate nuclei and putamen.

Diffusion. Marked bilateral diffuse cortical hyperintensity in caudate nuclei and putamen. Enlarged third ventricle.

Significant cortical atrophy, global enlargement of the ventricular cavities and significant atrophy of both cerebellar hemispheres and vermis.
The patient died 20 days after the last MRI study.
