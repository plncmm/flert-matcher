A 69-year-old man came to the emergency department with lumbar pain radiating to both lower limbs of 10 months' duration. Personal history of interest included arterial hypertension with hypertensive heart disease, non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidaemia, moderate emphysema type COPD (FEV1 76%), gouty arthritis and appendectomy. He was being studied by the urology department for haematuria, diagnosed by cytology as urothelial carcinoma. Ex-smoker for 30 years, no epidemiological history of interest: denies risky sexual relations, no recent trips abroad, no contact with animals or ingestion of unpasteurised products. Lives in an urban environment. She is being treated with ASA 100mg, candesartan 32/ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg, simvastatin 20mg and metformin 850mg. Allergy to paracetamol.

Patient admitted to the neurosurgery department for 10 months of intense low back pain, with pain radiating down the lateral aspect of the thigh and left leg to the external aspect of the foot, with paraesthesia at this level and on the dorsum of the foot. Two months before her admission, she began to experience pain in the contralateral leg, which limited her daily life, and she was being monitored by the Pain Unit without significant improvement. She also reported decreased strength in both lower limbs for a week. She has also been suffering from urinary retention for the last ten days and has required bladder catheterisation. The anamnesis highlights the appearance of occasional febrile fever of a few months' duration, with no bacteremic profile. She denied any other clinical manifestations in the anamnesis by organs and apparatus. On physical examination, the patient was haemodynamically stable, afebrile. Good general condition, conscious and oriented. Normal muscle balance with claudication of MMII in anti-gravity manoeuvres due to pain, no alterations in sensitivity, osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical except for left Achilles, which is abolished, positive left Lassegue and Braggard. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic without murmurs, respiratory with preserved vesicular murmur with fine tele-inspiratory crackles at the bases. Abdomen was nondescript. Lower limbs with oedema with minimal fovea at perimalleolar level, no signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulses preserved and symmetrical. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed lumbar spondylodiscarthrosis, predominantly L4-L5 and L5-S1. At this level there is an extruded herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) with involvement of both lateral recesses, plus the left one.

Basic blood and urine tests were requested, showing leucopenia (2750 leucocytes/mm3 with 61.4% polymorphonuclear, 21.5% lymphocytes, 14.9% monocytes), haemoglobin 9. 7 g/dl, MCV 88.7, platelets 164000/mm3, glucose 185 mg/dl, urea 31 mg/dl, creatinine 1.15 mg/dl, normal ionogram, total protein 5.5 g/l, calcium 8.5 mg/dl, corrected 9.5, procalcitonin 0.05 ng/ml. Urine with blood ++, rest negative.

Differential diagnosis
We are therefore dealing with a patient with long-standing low back pain, refractory to analgesic treatment, with associated neurological symptoms, attributed to a herniated disc, which was operated on. It also highlights the finding of bicytopenia (anaemia + leucopenia) in a patient with suspected urothelial neoplasia.

Taking low back pain as a guiding symptom, we should consider the following differential diagnosis, from most to least frequent:
- Diseases that cause narrowing of the canal or foramina, such as disc herniation, hypertrophy of the articular facets.
- Trauma, functional/postural overload, muscle contractures, vertebral fractures.
- Degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis.
- Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies.
- Tumours, both benign and malignant, mainly myeloma, sarcoma and metastases.
- Infections: pyogenic, tuberculous or brucellar spondylodiscitis.
- Miscellaneous: bone metabolism diseases (osteoporosis, Paget's disease, etc.), congenital anomalies of the lumbar spine, referred pain of visceral origin.

Given the patient's history and the presence of bicytopenia, one of the first diagnostic possibilities is that it is a degenerative lesion as reported by the MRI, and that the origin of the bicytopenia is iatrogenic; but we must also consider the possibility of lesions of metastatic origin with bone marrow involvement.

Evolution
During his stay in the neurosurgery ward, the patient began with self-limited episodes of temporo-spatial disorientation, occasionally associated with visual hallucinations, as well as progressive deterioration of the general state, associated with abdominal pain and nausea. A control analysis was performed, showing worsening renal function (creatinine levels of 3.19 mg/dl), and an abdominal CT scan was performed, showing a lytic lesion at L5-S1, which could be related to advanced degenerative changes, although the existence of a neoplastic or infectious process at this location could not be ruled out. The neurosurgery department then consulted Internal Medicine to complete the study. A complete blood analysis showed an LDH of 845 U/l, with negative or normal tumour markers, proteinogram and immunoglobulins. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed hypermetabolic foci correlated by CT with lytic lesions located at L5-S1, SUV 11.53 and 11.18 respectively. In the rest of the study, no other hypermetabolic foci suggesting the presence of macroscopic tumour activity were observed. In view of these findings, a CT-guided core needle biopsy of the L5 lesion was performed and a sample was sent for Pathology and Microbiology, which was cultured on standard media and media for mycobacteria. IGRA and blood culture were also requested to coincide with a fever peak. While awaiting the results, the patient's general condition deteriorated and there was an increase in pain in the lumbar region, so an MRI was performed which showed a destructive pattern of the vertebral platforms with extensive bone oedema at L5-S1. After contrast administration, abscessed collections in the disc, anterior epidural space (where it compresses thecal sac) and paravertebral (left psoas) are delimited. The findings were compatible with an infectious process (spondylodiscitis). In view of this result, a puncture of the left psoas abscess was scheduled and sent to microbiology for Gram staining, culture and PCR for tuberculosis. The results of the blood cultures were negative, IGRA positive and the microbiology of the bone biopsy was negative for the usual bacteria, with growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex sensitive to first-line antituberculosis drugs, so a diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis was made and treatment was started with Rimstar (Ethambutol 275mg, Isoniazid 75mg, Pyrazinamide 400mg, Rifampicin 150mg).
The results of the samples obtained from the psoas abscess were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by smear microscopy, PCR and culture.

The study was completed with sputum smears, which were negative on 3 occasions with negative culture for TB, although the sputum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was positive. A CT scan of the chest was performed and reported as follows: "Left apical scar-like lesion with calcification inside. Micronodules of subpleural predominance were observed in both upper lobes forming a "pseudo-tree in bud" pattern. Bilateral calcified granulomas in probable relation to previous TB. Mediastinal lymph nodes of non-significant size". After initiation of antituberculosis treatment and drainage of the psoas abscess, the patient evolved favourably, with adequate tolerance to medication, without new complications, and with improvement in analytical parameters.

Final diagnosis
Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott's disease). Pulmonary tuberculosis.
