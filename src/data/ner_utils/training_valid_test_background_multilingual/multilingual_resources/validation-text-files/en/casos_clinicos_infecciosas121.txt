Nine-year-old female schoolchild, previously healthy, presented with a clinical picture of eight months' duration with intermittent febrile fever generally associated with reduced consistency bowel movements, without mucus or blood and mild abdominal pain. She received antimicrobial and symptomatic management on several occasions. Nausea and vomiting of gastric contents were added. Infectious focus was attributed to the urinary tract and treatment with third generation cephalosporin was discontinued. The patient presented with deviation of the labial commissure to the right, poor coordination of limb movements (dysdiadochokinetic), disconnection from the environment, inability to follow commands and inadequate expression, with intermittent events lasting ten minutes and complete recovery of alertness. He persists with febrile syndrome for three months. She again showed signs of neurological focalisation with deviation of the labial commissure to the right, inability to close the right eye and to make gestures, bradyline, somnolence, fine hand tremor, ataxic gait with lateropulsion to the right and discrete exotropia of the right eye with diplopia, for which reason she went to the National Institute of Paediatrics for assessment. He was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of peripheral facial paralysis and cerebellar syndrome. Primary causes of the central nervous system, chronic neuroinfection or autoimmune pathology are suspected. Blood biometry with mild normochromic normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 11.4 g/dL and haematocrit 34.4%), the rest of the biometry without alterations. Serology for autoantibodies negative. Cerebrospinal fluid with microproteins 366 mg/dL, glucose 12 mg/dL, rock-water appearance, cells 40/mm3, mononuclear 40%, segmented 60%, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, bacterial culture, India ink and Gram stain negative. Adenosine deaminase in cerebrospinal fluid 3.5 U/L (0.00-9.00 U/L). Cryptococcus neoformans antigen negative. Cerebrospinal fluid PCR for panenterovirus, herpes simplex 1, 2 and 6 negative. IgG versus Borrelia burgdorferi in serum positive. Intravenous ceftriaxone was prescribed. The patient evolved satisfactorily with complete remission of the neurological deficit and completed the antibiotic regimen. She was discharged to continue outpatient surveillance.
