Female patient aged 7 months with unilateral mild ptosis and dacryorrhagia with crying and expression of the lacrimal sac since the age of fifteen days. She was born in Spain and her mother was from Eastern Europe. Ophthalmological examination revealed an upper subtarsal pseudomembrane and left preauricular adenopathy, without secretion or hyperemia, and superficial pannus in the upper limbic area. Lacrimal duct lavage was permeable and conjunctival exudate culture was negative. In the initial study, an MRI and ENT examination ruled out pathology of the paranasal sinuses and the lacrimal drainage system. Topical treatment with tobramycin and dexamethasone was started. One month later, partial resolution of the ptosis and total resolution of the pseudomembrane was observed. Two months later, subtarsal follicles persisted at different stages, so identification of Chlamydia trachomatis was requested by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which was positive. Topical treatment with erythromycin ointment and oral erythromycin (50 mg/kg/day in 4 doses) was started for 14 days. At the end of treatment the clinical findings had virtually disappeared. A PCR study of conjunctival exudate and urine of the individuals living in the household was performed. The only positive test was the urine of the mother, who was 29 weeks pregnant. However, the maternal cervical culture was negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. Systemic treatment was prescribed to the parents with erythromycin (500 mg/6 h) for 7 days. Eradication of the germ was confirmed by PCR of conjunctival exudate from the patient and maternal urine.
