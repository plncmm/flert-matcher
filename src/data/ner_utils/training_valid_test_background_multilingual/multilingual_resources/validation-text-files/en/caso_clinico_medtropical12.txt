A 44 year old woman from Ecuador was admitted to the cardiology department from the emergency department with complaints of general malaise, dizziness and paraesthesia in the left upper limb. Personal history: no cardiovascular risk factors were detected. In his childhood he lived in a rural area of Ecuador. Episode of arrhythmia in his native country with unknown diagnosis and treatment. Brother with a probable diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia and no alterations of interest were observed in the blood tests (biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation). Myocardial damage markers were negative. ECG: sinus rhythm with caralateral ischaemia. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles. Echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, severe hypokinesia of the inferoposterior aspect and apical aneurysm. Ergometry: performed with beta-blocker treatment. Performed 10 minutes of the Bruce protocol. Maximum frequency 132 bpm (75% of maximum theoretical frequency). Stopped due to dyspnoea without clinical signs of angina or ST-segment elevation. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles unrelated to exercise. Telemetry: abundant non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and idioventricular rhythm (RIVAS). Cardiac magnetic resonance: dilated left ventricle, EF 35%. Decreased myocardial wall thickness in the inferolateral, apical and medial segments, anterolateral segment with akinesia in these segments and dyskinesia of the apex. Transmural hyperenhancement of contrast (gadolinium) in medial inferolateral and partially anterolateral segments. Non-viable myocardium secondary to chronic infarction. Coronary angiography: no lesions in epicardial coronary arteries. Evolution: the patient, under follow-up in outpatient cardiology clinics, is clinically stable. In September 2007, she was admitted for acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVA) in the middle cerebral artery territory, which was fibrinolysed, without complications.  The sequelae were right hemiplegia and mixed aphasia. He is currently undergoing rehabilitation. Clinical judgement: Dilated cardiomyopathy with coronary arteries without lesions.
