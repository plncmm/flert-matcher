A 68-year-old man with no medical history was admitted to a local hospital on 22 March 2020 with fever, cough and dyspnoea of 8 days' duration. He had not travelled recently. His temperature was above 40°C, respiratory rate was 24 r.p.m. and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. A chest X-ray was compatible with pneumonia. He was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. A nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test was positive for acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient worsened and was intubated two days after hospitalisation; he was treated in ICU for 11 days. He failed a spontaneous breathing test and required reintubation 48 hours after extubation. He was transferred to the ICU of Aarhus University Hospital, due to inability to withdraw mechanical ventilation, muscle weakness and multi-organ failure. Central nervous system imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis ruled out neuroinfection or structural lesions. On clinical examination, he showed several severe distal and proximal symmetrical weaknesses (Medical Research Council index score: 2/5), diffuse muscle atrophy and absence of osteotendinous reflexes.
On the 65th day of hospitalisation, nerve conduction studies and a quantitative electromyogram were performed using conventional methods, on suspicion of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or critical patient polyneuropathy (CPP). Abnormal electromyogram findings were reduced motor unit potentials (MUP), consistent with myopathy in the biceps brachii and vastus medialis with passive joint movements, but no fibrillations or positive waves were observed, while bilateral profuse denervation was found in the tibialis anterior. Decreased left peroneal motor conduction velocity was observed at the ankle (27.8 m/s) but was normal at the leg (42.2 m/s); the right motor response was absent, as were bilateral superficial peroneal sensory action potentials, suggesting bilateral peroneal compression neuropathy. Sensory nerve conduction studies were normal in the median (CV: 53.7m/s, amplitude: 10.2μV), ulnar (CV: 51.2m/s, amplitude: 6.9μV) and right (CV: 51.6m/s, amplitude: 2.7μV) and left (CV: 49.2m/s, amplitude: 2.8μV) external saphenous nerves. In addition, reduced amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) were observed in the median (2.3mV), ulnar (1.6mV) and tibial (right: 0.8mV, left: 0.9mV) nerves. PAMC duration was only increased in the median nerve (8.5ms) and normal in the ulnar (6.9ms) and tibial (right: 7.2ms, left: 7.3ms) nerves. F waves were absent in all motor nerves. In the right median nerve, repetitive nerve stimulation was performed at 20 Hz with a 1-second pulse; immediately afterwards, F-waves with normal latencies and minimum frequencies were easily obtained. There was no decrease with repetitive stimulation at 3 Hz. In conclusion, the results indicated critical patient myopathy (CPM), but not GBS or CPP.
