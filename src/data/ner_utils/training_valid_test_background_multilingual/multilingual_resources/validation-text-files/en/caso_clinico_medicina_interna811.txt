Male, 45 years old. He lives in a rural epidemiological environment with contact with biomass, domestic animals and livestock, ex-smoker, diagnosed with stage IV Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma, splectomised and on Bendomustine-Rituximab treatment.
He came to the emergency department for dyspnoea and fever of 39 oC with acute onset. On arrival the patient was in a poor general state, normotensive, HR 149 bpm, tachypneic and with semiology of massive right pleural effusion which was confirmed by complementary tests among which we highlight: CRP 276 mg/L, Hb 8.4 g/L, MCV 92.4 fl/L. Leukocytes 4800 x 103/mcL (PMN 99.3 %; Lymphocytes 0 %). Pleural drainage was performed with Pleurevac√¢, obtaining exudative amber liquid and empirical antibiotherapy was started with imipienem and iv amikacin. The patient was admitted to hospital for hypoxemic left apical pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. Blood cultures isolated Campylobacter coli and antibiotic therapy with azithromycin and teicoplanin was administered, although the clinical course was torpid, requiring admission to the ICU due to multi-organ failure: acute oliguric renal failure requiring haemodialysis and deterioration of the level of consciousness with the need for orotracheal intubation. Microbiological studies were extended with bronchoalveolar lavage. Chest CT scan showed pulmonary infiltrates and signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, and anticoagulation with unfractionated Heparin was started. As encephalopathy persisted during the neurological windows, a cranial CT scan was performed, showing hypodense lesions which were later catalogued by cerebral MRI. The evolution in the ICU was unsatisfactory and it was impossible to wean the patient from IMV, with skin lesions appearing on the rib cage and left thigh in the form of retiform purpura, which were biopsied. The results of LBA and skin biopsy showed isolation of Lichtheimia corymbifera and the patient was classified as having invasive fungal disease (pulmonary, CNS and cutaneous) and treatment was started with liposomal anforeticin B. The option of surgical treatment of the brain lesions was discarded. The patient finally died after 24 days of hospitalisation.
Lichtheimia crymbifera is an angioinvasive fungus of the order Mucolaris that affects immunocompromised patients, clinically indistinguishable from fusarium or aspergillus, with a poor prognosis in the vast majority of descriptions in the literature.
