A 78-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension, chronic renal disease, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, moderate mitral insufficiency and severe aortic stenosis who required transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) one year ago.
He was admitted to Internal Medicine for constitutional syndrome of 11 months of evolution, shortly after TAVI implantation, with hyporexia and weight loss of 33kg. He was associated with significant asthenia, generalised arthromyalgia, worsening of his usual dyspnoea and orthopnoea with reduced diuresis.
Examination revealed significant cachexia and the presence of a polyfocal pansystolic murmur. On the lower extremities there were purpuric lesions that were not raised, with a "sock-like" distribution.
Initial blood tests showed haemoglobin 10.9 g/dL normocytic normocytic normochromic, leukocytosis with left shift, CRP 224 mg/L, ESR 101 mm/h, BNP 1,618 pg/mL and mild renal insufficiency. Subsequently, electrocardiogram, venous blood gas analysis, systematic urine analysis and chest X-ray were performed with no relevant findings. During hospital admission, a body-CT scan was performed without contrast (due to renal failure), which revealed a 5.8cm splenic infarction. In addition, blood cultures were taken and were repeatedly positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography also showed diffuse thickening (7mm) of the mitro-aortic fibrosis with an image of dissection of the latter, which led to the appearance of severe mitral insufficiency.
Given the findings obtained, the patient fulfilled the Duke criteria (2 major + 3 minor), and was finally diagnosed with Infective Endocarditis on TAVI due to S. epidermidis. Antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Fosfomycin was started, and later, on an outpatient basis, suppressive antibiotic treatment with Dalbavancin was started, given the patient's unacceptable surgical risk.
