Male patient aged 49 years, smoker of 40 packs/year, with no relevant pathological history, has been working as a freight forwarder for 10 years. His clinical picture began 8 months ago with a productive cough and mucous expectoration associated with weight loss (approximately 20 kg in 1 year). In the 15 days prior to the consultation he added dyspnoea CF II - III, for which he was admitted to a private institution; the symptoms were interpreted as bilateral pneumonia and he was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 g every 8 hours plus oseltamivir 75 mg every 12 hours. After discharge, the patient was seen at the outpatient clinic with persistent cough and slight improvement in dyspnoea; the chest X-ray showed cottony opacities with an alveolar pattern, predominantly in both lower fields.

Laboratory values were as follows: hto 38%; leukocytes 9,100 / mm3 (PMN 70% Lymph 25%, MN 4%, Eo 1%); platelets 375,000; glycaemia 88 mg/dL; urea 0.40 g/L creatinine 0.6 mg/dL; Ionogram Na+ 135/ K+ 4.2/ Cl- 101 mmol/L; TGO 33 UI/L; TGP 48 UI/L; FAL 220 UI/L. HIV serology negative. PPD negative. EAB 7.40/38/78/78/22/93% (0.21).
Chest CT showed extensive opacities in both lower fields with air bronchogram inside and crazy paving pattern in the right upper field.

Chest CT scan (sagittal view): multiple images of alveolar consolidation in both lower lobes, associated with ground-glass images in the right upper lobe.

Chest CT (coronal sections): A) Ground-glass images with thickening of the interlobular septa (crazy paving) predominantly in the right upper lobe. B) Consolidation images with alveolar filling and air bronchogram, with greater involvement of the right lower lobe.

CBF was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (BTB), where no endoluminal lesions were observed. The results of BAL for common germs, BAAR, and cytology were negative. The results of the BTB and the rest of the BAL tests were received.
