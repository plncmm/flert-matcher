 Male patient aged 56 years, from Ayacucho, from Sihuas (Ancash), a local resident since he was 14 years old, a welder, also since he was 14 years old, his place of work is near a river, where he washes his tools. He has not travelled to other places outside Ancash for 5 years. He was admitted to the emergency department of the Dos de Mayo National Hospital on 03/05/2013, and then to the Santo Toribio medical ward, with a period of illness of 20 days, characterised by an unquantified thermal sensation, predominantly at night, which partially subsided after taking antipyretics, and general malaise. Three days before admission he presented nausea, vomiting, pallor and jaundice. Due to the persistence of the symptoms, he decided to travel directly to Lima for treatment. He denied cough, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. History: she had been ill with pulmonary tuberculosis (20 years ago) without treatment. Family history: she has four children, two girls and two boys (all with pulmonary TB 15 years ago with full treatment).

On physical examination his vital functions were: BP: 90/50 mmHg. HR: 120 beats/min. HR: 28 breaths/minute. T: 38.5 Â°C (oral). Patient in regular general condition, poor hydration status, regular nutritional status, oriented, painful facies (refers intense pain in left shoulder), looks sweaty, whiny, ventilating spontaneously. Skin: warm, poorly hydrated, jaundice on sclerae and skin (++/+++), pallor (++/+++). Lymphatics: bilateral retrocervical lymphadenopathies of approx. 0.5-1 cm, mobile, soft, non-painful, inguinal lymphadenopathies of +/- 1.5 cm in diameter with similar characteristics to the previous ones. Respiratory system: vesicular murmur passes well in both hemithoraxes, rough breathing. Cardiovascular system: rhythmic heart sounds, not very intense, tachycardic, no murmurs. Abdomen: soft, depressible, diffuse pain on deep palpation, predominantly in the right hypochondrium, liver 6 cm below the right costal margin, liver spam 13 cm; spleen not palpable, positive Murphy's sign. Neurological system: Glasgow Glasgow score of 15 points. The rest of the physical examination was unaltered.

Laboratory tests on admission: Hb: 11.8 mg/dL, group: O+; glucose: 102 mg/dL; reticulocytes: 3%, negative direct Coombs' test. Hepatitis C antibodies not reactive. Non-reactive hepatitis B surface antigen. Coagulation profile normal. Serial electrolytes within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed right apical pleural thickening and reticular images in the right lung, predominantly in the apex (probably due to sequelae of a previous inflammatory process); subsequently, serial sputum smears for pulmonary tuberculosis were negative on three occasions.

In the first three days of hospitalisation, progressive deterioration of the general condition, generalised myalgias exacerbated by palpation, severe pallor and increasing jaundice were observed. Table 1 shows a marked and persistent drop in haemoglobin levels, reaching the level of severe anaemia (Hb: 6.7 g/dL), doubling of leukocyte levels in just one day (severe leukocytosis) with left shift and elevated C-reactive protein. Given that the patient presented fever, marked pallor and jaundice, a general infectious process was suspected and the differential diagnoses of Carrion's disease (he came from Ancash), viral hepatitis and acute cholangitis were suggested. Blood samples were sent to the laboratories of the "Daniel Alcides Carrion" Institute of Tropical Medicine of the UNMSM and the National Institute of Health, which were both positive for Bartonella bacilliformis in Giemsa staining; The results of the culture were subsequently positive for this agent. Given the torpid evolution and the persistence of fever and the clinical deterioration of the patient, over-aggregated infections were investigated with the following tests: agglutinations (typhoid, paratyphoid and brucella); blood cultures repeated on two occasions, urine culture and myeloculture, all negative, but microagglutination was positive in titre 1/600 for Leptospira pomona. These results led to the conclusion that the patient had severe Carrion's disease complicated by acute leptospirosis.

The evolution showed improvement in both clinical and biochemical patterns, with urea and creatinine levels gradually normalising. Two globular packets were transfused and specific antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin) was started according to current technical standards, and after 10 days, he was discharged from the service.
