Our case is a 73-year-old woman with a history of biliary lithiasis. She came to the emergency department with aphasia and decreased sensitivity and strength in all four limbs, of 24 hours' evolution. She had a fever of over 38oC with shivering for 10 days and a weight loss of 12 kg in the last 2 months, asthenia, generalised arthralgias, xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
On examination, the patient's vital signs were normal except for a temperature of 37.8oC. Neurologically, he presented with aphasia, including simple commands, effacement of the right nasolabial fold and a tendency to look to the left. He was able to move all four limbs with claudication of the right limbs.
Laboratory tests showed white blood cells 13,330 with 85.4% N, CRP 8.3 mg/dL, ESR 59, LDH 883, renal function, ions, coagulation, ECG and chest X-ray normal. Tumour markers, proteinogram, immunoglobulins, TSH, ACE, complement, blood and urine cultures were normal. Autoimmunity was positive with ANAs nucleolar pattern 1/320 and SS-A(RO) 53. Cranial CT scan showed multiple hypodense foci affecting the left lenticular nucleus, caudate nucleus and corona radiata. The study was completed with MRI, and the diagnosis was ischaemic stroke of the left MCA and silent infarcts in the right MCA territory. The CSF study and electroencephalogram were normal.
After an episode of dyspnoea, echocardiography ruled out endocarditis and CT angiography showed bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism. Given the hypercoagulable state, constitutional symptoms and fever, a special coagulation study was requested, which was normal, as well as a CT scan where the findings suggested vesicular carcinoma with contiguous hepatic infiltration with hilar adenopathies. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, where a 6 cm image was observed in segment VIII of the liver, from which samples were obtained for pathological anatomy and culture by percutaneous biopsy. The final diagnoses were cholangiocarcinoma and hepato-biliary abscess due to Clostridium perfringens.
The interest of this case lies in the differential diagnosis of hypercoagulable state and constitutional syndrome, as was the case in our patient, where the diagnosis of S. Sj√∂gren's disease was followed by a neoplasm with hidden associated infection.
