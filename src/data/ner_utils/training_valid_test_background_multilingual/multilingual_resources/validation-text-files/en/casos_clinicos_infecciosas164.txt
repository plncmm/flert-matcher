In August 2005, a seven-year-old peasant boy was admitted to the Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde, who started abruptly with fever, headache, pain in the hypogastrium and vomiting; the doctor prescribed penicillin 100,000 IU/kg every 12h, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 30 mg/kg every 12h, for three days. He went to hospital for abrupt onset of fever, confusion, petechiae and conjunctival haemorrhages. 
She also presented with retro sternal pain, facial oedema, arthralgia in the wrists and ankles, choluria and pruritic petechial rash on the chest and extremities. Five days prior to admission, he presented conjunctival haemorrhage, confusion, drowsiness, with headache and non-productive cough; he went to the Regional Hospital of Yahualica, Jalisco, and was referred to this institution.
History of hospitalisation of the father for fever and abdominal pain, diagnosed with typhoid fever. Two grandparents had recurrent fever. History of exposure to cattle infested with lice, fleas and ticks. His father was diagnosed with typhoid fever a few days before.
On physical examination the child was confused, with dry cough, no evidence of respiratory distress. Slight bipalpebral oedema and ecchymosis, bilateral conjunctival haemorrhage, normal funduscopy. Petechiae on face, chest, extremities, palms and soles; a systolic murmur in mitral focus II/VI; lung fields with presence of vesicular murmur present, liver 6 cm below the right costal border, spleen 2 cm below the left costal border.
Laboratory tests: initially with leucopenia and liver enzymes with the following results: GGT 109 (8-37), Fos Alc 241, total bilirubin 1.1 (0.2-1.0). Serologies were requested for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein Baar Virus, Cytomegalovirus, which were negative; Weil-Felix test with titres of typhus H, Huddleson, typhus A and B neg, typhus O (+) 1:80, Ox Proteus Positive 1: 640, ALT 81 IU (10-40) AST 90 IU (10-50) DHL 650 IU (91-90), Fos Alc 262 IU (42-98), Bil T 1. 1 gr/dl (0.2-1.0). Anti Rickettsial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence: Q Fever IgG phase I, Q Fever IgM phase I, Q Fever IgG phase II, Q Fever IgM phase II: all less than 1:16; Rocky Mountain Fever IgG and IgM: both less than 1:64; Typhoid IgG Positive 1:128, Typhoid IgM Positive 1:128.
Serology positive IgM for Rickettsia prowazekii.
The patient was started on doxycycline 25 mg/kg every 12 hr and fever disappeared on the third day.

The diagnosis was based on the result of a cross-reaction with Weil Felix: Proteus OX-19 titres 1:640. We suspected rickettsiosis in the patient and requested antigen determination for R. prowasekii which corroborated a case of epidemic typhoid.
Epidemic typhus should be evaluated in a population exposed to lice, as we do not know the real frequency in our environment, which should be considered as an emerging disease with high lethality.
