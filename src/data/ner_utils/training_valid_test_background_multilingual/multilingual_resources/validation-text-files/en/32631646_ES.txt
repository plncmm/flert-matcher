A 61-year-old woman from Equatorial Guinea, resident in Spain for years, diagnosed with arterial hypertension, on treatment with lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, hypertensive heart disease, with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, arthrosis, chikingunya and chronic venous disease as medical and surgical antecedents.
The patient was being monitored by the primary care team (EAP) for possible COVID-19, after being contacted by a COVID-19 patient, initially reporting mild gastrointestinal symptoms with nausea and diarrhoeal stools without pathological products. Given the absence of serious symptoms, periodic telephone monitoring was carried out by the EAP with symptomatic treatment, relative rest, abundant hydration and home isolation, with notification in the event of worsening and/or alarm symptoms that were explained.
In the telephone follow-up, on the 4th day after the onset of symptoms, she reported the appearance of a dry cough and odynophagia, accompanied, on the 9th day, by mild chest pain, not reporting fever or a feeling of dizziness or general malaise or associated dyspnoea, for which reason she was followed up by telephone.
In the third week after the onset of symptoms, she reported pain in the right lower limb (MID) with oedema, heat, flushing and an increase in circumference with respect to the contralateral limb, and was referred to the hospital emergency department for assessment of probable deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The rest of the physical examination, including cardiopulmonary auscultation, was unaltered. BP: 134/73mmHg; HR: 108lpm; HR: 12rpm; SatO2 99%.
A blood test was performed in the emergency department, showing glucose 149mg/dl, LDH 319U/l (135-214), D-dimer 2,050ng/ml (208-500), with the rest of the biochemical parameters analysed, blood count and coagulation within normal limits.
The chest X-ray showed an increase in the bronchovascular tract and a dubious infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
Doppler ultrasound showed patency of the common femoral, superficial, popliteal, tibioperoneal trunk and twin veins, ruling out DVT.
On suspicion of acute respiratory disease due to coronavirus (COVID-19), with unilobar pneumonia, hydroxychloroquine was prescribed.
Given the clinical symptoms suggestive of DVT and association with elevated D-dimer and symptoms compatible with COVID-19, it was decided, taking into account the patient's good condition, the absence of dyspnoea and the epidemiological situation at the time, following hospital protocol, to initiate LMWH at therapeutic doses and outpatient clinical follow-up, prescribing treatment with bemiparin at a dose of 10,000 IUI every 24h and recommendations to avoid venous stasis.
Doppler ultrasound was repeated after 15 days, showing 2cm superficial venous thrombosis in the distal third of the MID (not adjacent to the saphenous vein), with no evidence of bilateral DVT.
The patient improved progressively, with no incidents or complications, so that after a month of treatment with LMWH, and after confirming clinical improvement, being asymptomatic, it was decided to discontinue treatment with bemiparin, maintaining physical anti-oedema measures such as recommended weight reduction, daily exercise and compression stockings.
