A 4-year-old girl, with no history of interest, consulted for painful left cervical swelling and fever (38oC), of a few hours' evolution. The previous day, after complaining of pain at occipital level, the parents observed a tick on the scalp, which they removed manually. Three days earlier, the girl had been in a rural area in contact with animals.

Physical examination revealed an erythematous plaque 1 cm in diameter with a central eschar over the tick bite area in the left parietoccipital region, painful ipsilateral cervical swelling, no rash, and the rest of the examination was normal. Plaque 1 cm in diameter, with central necrotic eschar after tick bite.

CBC and biochemistry were normal, with no elevation of acute phase reactants, and cervical ultrasound showed inflammatory lymphadenopathies, predominantly in the left laterocervical region, not abcessed, the largest measuring 3.2 x 1.2 cm. Cervical ultrasound. Adenopathy measuring 3.2 x 1.2 cm, inflammatory and non-abcessed.

Tick-borne lymphadenopathy or TIBOLA (Tick-Borne Lymphadenopathy) was suspected. Treatment with oral doxycycline (5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours) was prescribed in a short 2-day regimen. Both patients were afebrile in the first 24 hours, with a progressive decrease in cervical adenitis until they were asymptomatic. Serology was performed at diagnosis and at 6 weeks, in both cases, against Rickettsia conorii and Borrelia burdorferi (the only serologies available in our area) with negative results.
