Clinical picture of about 7 days of evolution.

Anaemia study: thalassaemic trait with anaemia due to gestation and chronic disease.
False positive Coombs.
Serology: rubella IgG +, herpes IgG +, TXP IgG +, IgM -, AgHBs, antiHBs and antiHBc negative, CMV IgG and IgM positive, lúes: CLIA + (negative in December 2014), RPR negative (pending new sample). Serum CMV PCR: negative sputum culture: meningococcus isolated (antibiogram cannot be performed). Pneumococcal and Legionella antigenuria negative. Serial sputum smears negative.
Chest X-ray: right pulmonary base infiltrate right pulmonary base venous doppler imaging MMII: no signs of venous thrombosis.
Echocardiogram: dilatation of right chambers with pressure overload. Probable severe pulmonary hypertension (IT GPmax 70 mmHg + dilated IVC with inspiratory collapse <50%). Preserved LV systolic function. Mild to moderate pericardial effusion.
Cardiac catheterisation: non-dilated LV, without segmental abnormalities AND normal EF (81%). Coronary arteries without significant lesions. Right catheterisation: AD: 3 mmHg, AP: 89/30 (mean 53 mmHg), PCP 21 mmHg. Pulmonary hypertension.

EVOLUTION
Favourable pneumonia with empirical antibiotic treatment. Pvea ++ oedema and dyspnoea on slight exertion attributable to PHT persist. She was assessed on several occasions by Gynaecology-Obstetrics (she had an appointment for a high-risk consultation within 48 hours). The Pulmonary Hypertension Unit was contacted and the patient was monitored on an outpatient basis.

DIAGNOSIS
Stage C3 HIV infection
Acute respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.
Severe HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension
Lúes
Gestation 25 weeks
