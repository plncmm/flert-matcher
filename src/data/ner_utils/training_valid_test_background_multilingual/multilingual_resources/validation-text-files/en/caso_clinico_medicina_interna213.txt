An 89-year-old man came to the emergency department with disorientation, fever of 38o and headache. The patient had an allergy to pyrazolones, dyslipidaemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, non-revascularised coronary artery disease with preserved LVEF and a prostate adenocarcinoma in complete remission. She was independent for basic activities of daily living with an active life and no cognitive impairment.
Physical examination revealed a decreased level of consciousness with a tendency to somnolence, bradypilepsy and bradypsychia. A cranial computerised tomography (CT) scan showed no alterations, so empirical treatment was started with Acyclovir and Ceftriaxone. Admission was continued and lumbar puncture was postponed as the patient was anticoagulated. During his admission he developed skin lesions of approximately two millimetres, predominantly on the trunk, some of which were vesicular and in a pustular phase with similar lesions on the jugal mucosa.
Among the complementary tests performed, the blood analysis and X-ray showed no relevant alterations and the blood cultures were sterile. Subsequently, after withdrawal of anticoagulation, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) puncture was performed, obtaining xanthochromic fluid with 230 leukocytes/mcL (90% mononuclear), 40% glucose and 210 mg/dL protein. In view of the suspicion of viral meningitis, serology for HBV, HCV, HIV, EBV, CMV, HSV1, HSV2, HSV6, HSV8 and rickettsiae were negative. Serology and CSF PCR for VZV were positive. Samples were also taken from the skin lesions, which were also positive for VZV.
After diagnosis of VZV encephalitis, treatment with acyclovir was continued, initially with good evolution. However, on the seventh day, the patient began to show a decreased level of consciousness and agitation. An MRI scan showed multiple intraparenchymal haemorrhagic intraparenchymal lesions in the right temporal uncus and haemorrhagic lesions in the cortico-subcortical area. The diagnosis of haemorrhagic stroke secondary to VZV vasculitis was therefore established. During the course of a month of hospitalisation, the patient also presented a picture of incoercible vomiting of central origin which was treated with chlorpromazine. After clinical improvement, he was finally discharged to a rehabilitation centre where he continued to recover his functional status.
