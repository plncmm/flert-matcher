A 9-year-old boy from the town of Pozo Azul (San Pedro) suffered the accident in November 2014 while playing near an avocado plant. He was taken approximately 48 hours after the accident to the hospital in Puerto IguazÃº, after his mother observed bleeding gums (gingivorragia). He was admitted lucid, with vomiting and headache, showing burning pain in the area of contact (urticant dermatitis). He had haematomas on the left leg, heel of the right foot, left arm and wrist of the right hand. There was no oedema or necrosis on the affected limb, but regional lymphadenopathy was present. Laboratory tests showed the following values: red blood cells 3 600 000/mm3; leucocytes 9 000/mm3; platelets 190 000/mm3; haematocrit 32%; AP 25%; KPTT > 60 seconds. At the Laboratory of Entomology and Taxonomy of the INMeT (Argentina), the specimens of the causative animal brought by the patient at the time of consultation were identified as larvae of L. obliqua, and a diagnosis of Lonomia erucism was made. The administration of specific antivenom and adjuvant treatment with corticosteroids (hydrocortisone), anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen), antihistamines (diphenhydramine) and vitamin K was indicated. The day after admission, the following laboratory results were obtained: red blood cells 4 220 000/mm3; leukocytes 6 300/mm3; platelets 253 000/mm3; haematocrit 34%; haemoglobin 11 g/dl; AP 100% and KPTT 32 seconds. Thus, with the evident clinical and laboratory improvement, the patient was discharged from hospital after 3 days of hospitalisation.
