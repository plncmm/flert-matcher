Anamnesis
A 21-year-old male, with no past history of interest, presented to the emergency department of our centre with a 4-day history of fever, pharyngeal pain and odynophagia, together with the appearance of few painful skin lesions on the left hand and right leg. Two weeks earlier, he had presented an episode of fever, without other symptoms, self-limited in a few days. Also, a week before the current episode, he had already visited the emergency department for swelling and pain in the right ankle, without previous trauma, which had been diagnosed as a sprain by the orthopaedic surgeons, and which resolved spontaneously. The patient denied dysuria, urethral discharge, arthralgias other than those he presented with in the ankle, testicular pain or swelling. He reported sexual relations only with a stable partner in the last three months. The emergency department, which provisionally diagnosed the skin lesions as folliculitis, requested assessment by dermatology.

Physical examination
The patient had a temperature of 37.5oC. A pustule measuring 9 millimetres in diameter was observed on the volar aspect of the fifth finger of the left hand, with a purpuric base. There were also pustular lesions surrounded by an erythematous halo on the right leg, the largest of which was an indurated nodule measuring about 2 centimetres in the gemellar area, with a pustular centre. Mucosal examination revealed slight pharyngeal hyperemia. No other skin or nail lesions were detected. The rest of the physical examination was normal.

Complementary examinations
The blood test showed no abnormalities except for a C-reactive protein of 85 mg/L. As the skin lesions and history suggested a systemic infectious condition, echocardiography, cultures of blood, urine, pharynx and the contents of the digital pustule were requested, and a biopsy of the larger lesion on the right leg was performed. Echocardiography revealed no abnormalities. The biopsy showed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue, as well as oedema of the papillary dermis, with no signs of vasculitis or septic emboli. Cultures were negative, except for the pharyngeal culture, in which Neisseria gonorrhoeae grew.

Diagnosis
Disseminated gonococcal infection.

Treatment
Empirical treatment was initially started with intravenous ceftriaxone, with disappearance of fever after 24 hours. Once the aetiology was confirmed, and after clinical improvement, the patient was switched to oral cefixime 400 mg every 12 hours, until completing 10 days of treatment.

Evolution
Symptoms and skin lesions resolved completely with treatment.
