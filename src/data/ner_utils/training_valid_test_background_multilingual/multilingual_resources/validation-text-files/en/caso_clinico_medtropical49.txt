This is a 21-year-old male patient of mixed race, from the Centro Habana municipality in Havana City, with a history of being a carrier of coeliac disease for which he had a previous admission in 2009, and who had never left the country. He was admitted on 21 August 2009, because for 20 days, after eating breaded fish at a public sale in the municipality of Playa, he began to suffer from diarrhoea, which intensified as the days went by, with more than 15 diarrhoeal stools, abundant in quantity, without phlegm or blood, accompanied by malnutrition, with general symptoms of asthenia and intense anorexia. The patient was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department of the "Hermanos Ameijeiras" Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital, with a possible diagnosis of coeliac disease in acute crisis, and protein-energy malnutrition.

Jejunoscopy (18 September 2009).

- Jejunitis with atrophic appearance.
- Mild antral gastritis.

Results of jejunal biopsy:

- Severe partial villous atrophy with increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes compatible with intestinal malabsorption syndrome.

Parasitological diagnosis

On 14 September 2009, after telephone consultation, 2 samples of diarrhoeal faeces were sent to the Intestinal Parasitism Laboratory of the Parasitology Sub-Directorate of the "Pedro Kour√≠" Institute of Tropical Medicine (IPK), one of which had been taken the previous week and another fresh sample on the same day, because the hospital laboratory had observed some eggs similar to Ascaris, but not finally identified, as there were doubts about this diagnosis.

In the Parasitology Laboratory of the IPK, both diarrhoeal samples were observed with abundant helminth eggs, characterised by a thick, tenuously striated shell, with the presence of 2 somewhat prominent polar caps or terminals, which coincide with those of the genus Paracapillaria (Capillaria). These eggs were identified both by direct microscopic examination with eosin and lugol, and by brine flotation concentration (Willis) and cone-cup sedimentation techniques.

To verify the species, egg length and width measurements were made using an Olympus BH-2 microscope with a micrometer scale inserted in the ocular lens. Measurements were taken on 30 eggs.

This confirmed the presence of eggs of the species Paracapillaria philippinensis, because they were in the known length range, according to Chitwood's description of the parasite in 19683 and Moravec's redescription in 2001, in samples collected from infected patients in the Philippines.

Case follow-up

Given the initial suspicion of ascaridiasis by the laboratory, and taking into account the patient's poor general condition, treatment with mebendazole at 200 mg every 12 h was started on 12 September, but for only 3 d. When the new parasitological diagnosis was confirmed, the attending physicians decided to maintain the medication at the same dose, but for 21 d. A stool sample was taken from the patient's stool.

An evolving stool sample was taken on the fourth day of treatment, and was negative in the parasitological study, despite the use of concentration techniques (Willis and cone-cup sedimentation) in addition to direct examination. In addition, the patient's general condition improved from 15 diarrhoeal stools per day and a weight of 37 kg at admission to 4 diarrhoeal stools per day in the first few days of antiparasitic therapy and had increased to 44.7 kg by day 12 of treatment.
