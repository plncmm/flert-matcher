Anamnesis
Two-year-old girl, of healthy, non-consanguineous parents, with no obstetric complications or relevant medical or surgical history. Vaccination schedule correctly completed. She consulted the emergency department for mildly pruritic skin lesions, predominantly on the left side of the body. The parents describe an abrupt onset 20 days ago in the left axillary region with rapid unilateral extension, without any improvement with the application of medium strength topical corticosteroid recommended by the paediatrician. They report no prodromal symptoms or previous infectious focus and deny the use of new topical products in that area.

Physical examination
The most striking feature of this papular erythematous rash is the asymmetry in the distribution of the lesions. The axilla and left upper limb, ipsilateral side and thigh, palms and soles are affected. There are some isolated confluent papules on the right thigh.
The patient remains afebrile and in good general condition, with no pathological findings in the examination by apparatus and systems.

Complementary examinations
Blood tests, including biochemistry, haemogram and haemostasis, showed no significant alterations.
Viral serology was positive for IgM Herpes virus 6. The remaining serum antibodies (Herpes virus 7, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus, Adenovirus) were negative.

Diagnosis
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthema of infancy Treatment and evolution
Given that he had been treated with topical corticosteroids with no improvement and given the initial clinical suspicion of viral exanthema, pending serological confirmation, clinical surveillance and symptomatic treatment of pruritus with oral antihistamines were recommended. After two weeks the lesions had resolved, with no post-inflammatory desquamation or pigmentation.
