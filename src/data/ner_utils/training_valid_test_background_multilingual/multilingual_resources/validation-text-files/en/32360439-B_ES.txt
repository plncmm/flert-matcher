An 83-year-old woman with a history of frequent urinary tract infections, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and neuropathy presented to the emergency department with fever, facial paralysis, slurred speech and reduced oral intake. Initial vital signs were significant for temperature (38.6°C), pulse (94 bpm), blood pressure (172/64 mmHg) and room air saturation (94%). Physical examination revealed left facial paralysis and stammering, with no other neurological deficits. A value of 2 on the NIHSS scale was calculated. Blood test showed leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia. Urinalysis was within normal limits; chest X-ray showed bilateral peripheral opacities. Cranial CT revealed no acute alterations. A craniomaxillofacial angiography showed no major vascular occlusions, with moderate focal stenosis of the MCA, as well as bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities in the pulmonary vertices. Based on fever and radiological findings, COVID-19 was suspected. A PCR test detected the presence of the virus. D-dimer and other markers of inflammation were not found. Chest radiography progressively worsened with bilateral infiltrates. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. No arrhythmias were noted during hospitalisation. On day 3 of hospitalisation, the patient presented with left hemineglect and worsening left facial paralysis with left hemiparesis. Speech was normal. A value of 16 on the NIHSS scale was calculated. A new head CT scan showed a new moderate hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, indicative of acute infarction. The patient was considered too high risk for thrombolysis or neurosurgical intervention. A CT angiography was planned before starting Integrilin treatment; however, her respiratory status worsened and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Shortly thereafter, the family decided to terminate treatment.
