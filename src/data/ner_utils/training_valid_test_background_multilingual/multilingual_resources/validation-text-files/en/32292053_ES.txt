On February 3, 2020, a 2-month and 21-day-old boy, born on November 13, 2019, was admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit at the Mother and Child Hospital in Hubei Province (Wuhan China). He had been coughing and wheezing for three days, with dyspnoea for the past 12 hours, but no other symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. His mother took him to the emergency department.
The father, who had had a fever and cough for three days, was treated at another hospital for possible COVID-19. In addition, the father's chest CT scan, performed at another hospital, showed ground-glass opacities in the lung, indicating the possibility of viral pneumonia. The mother had no fever or cough, and they did not live with other family members. The neighbourhood of the patient's family is about 15 km from the Huanan wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, and there is no family history of contact with the market. However, 5 people in the patient's neighbourhood had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The infant was born at term and was given the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) on the first day. The patient had no relevant family history of asthma.

On the first day of admission (day 1), physical examination revealed the following data: temperature 37 °C, respiratory rate 52 bpm, pulse 170 bpm, blood pressure 89/46 mmHg, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) 89%, weight 6.4 kg. Cardiac examination was normal, but signs of dyspnoea were evident and wheezing and expectoration sounds were noted with the stethoscope. The abdomen was soft and depressible and no splenomegaly was detected on palpation but hepatomegaly was detected on palpation 2 cm below the costal margin.

Initial laboratory tests gave the following results: leucocyte count 8.81 (normal range = 4-10) × 109/L; lymphocytes 6.14 × 109/L (normal range = 1-3); neutrophils 1.41 × 109/L (normal range = 2-6); eosinophils 0.23 × 109/L (normal range = 0.02-0.52); thrombocytes 603 × 109/L (normal range = 100-300) and haemoglobin 108 g/L (normal range = 110-120). The serum immunoglobulin (Ig) profile was as follows: IgG 3.9 g/L (normal range = 2.6-6.9); IgM 0.37 g/L (normal range = 0.26-1) and IgA 0.11 g/L (normal range = 0.08-0.57); C3 0.96 g/L (normal range = 0.65-1.52) and C4 0.13 g/L (normal range = 0.16-0.38). Analysis of peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations, assessed by flow cytometry, yielded the following results: total T lymphocytes 66.2% (normal range = 55% to 78%); helper T lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+) 32.7% (normal range = 27% to 53%); suppressor T lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+) 27.4% (normal range = 19% to 34%); B lymphocytes (CD3? CD19+) 28.5% (normal range = 10% to 31%); natural killer lymphocytes 4.2% (normal range = 4% to 26%). In addition, the procalcitonin value was 2.0 ng/mL (normal value < 0.5). Liver function tests were normal. Analytical tests for respiratory viruses, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), including adenovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus and parainfluenza virus 1/2/3 were negative, but positive for respiratory syncytial virus. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral lung infection and consolidation in part of the lower lobe of the left lung. Arterial blood gases gave the following results: pH 7.33, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 65 mm Hg, PaCO2 38 mm Hg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) 91%, EB ?5.5 mmol/L, HCO3 ?20 mmol/L, glucose 5.3 mmol/L, lactate 5.4 mmol/L. Consequently, severe pneumonia was diagnosed and non-invasive continuous positive mechanical ventilation (CPV) was immediately applied on admission. Antibiotic treatment with ceftizoxime (50 mg/kg, i.v. twice daily) was started as bacterial pneumonia was suspected. Prior to antibacterial treatment, venous blood and sputum samples were sent for culture, but 5 days later, the results were negative. In addition, he was treated with i.v. gamma globulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg). (IVIG, 2 g/kg body weight, in 2 doses) and methylprednisolone (2 g/kg, twice daily for 3 days). Although the result of the pharyngeal swab qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was negative 26 hours after admission, he was given inhaled interferon (0.5 million U/kg, sterile solution, twice daily).

On day 5, due to improvement in the patient's condition, non-invasive CPP was withdrawn and he was switched to nasal cannula oxygen therapy. In addition, blood tests were repeated: leukocytes 4.60 × 109/L; lymphocytes 3.27 × 109/L; neutrophils 1.05 × 109/L; eosinophils 0.01 × 109/L; thrombocytes 416 × 109/L; haemoglobin 80 g/L. By telephone communication we obtained the information that the patient's parents' pharyngeal swab tests by qRT-PCR, obtained at another hospital, were negative and that the mother's chest CT scan was normal.
On day 10, the patient had a mild cough, no fever and no expectoration, and pulmonary signs had improved. However, a pharyngeal swab test by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, with a positive result. The patient continued with symptomatic treatment.
On day 17, the patient showed no fever or cough, pulmonary signs were normal and oxygen therapy was withdrawn. A pharyngeal swab test by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was then performed, with a negative result.

On day 19, a pharyngeal swab test by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was repeated with a negative result. On day 20, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the lung infection had almost completely absorbed. Accordingly, he was discharged from hospital and remained on home asylum with his mother for two weeks.
