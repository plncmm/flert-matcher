A 6-year-old girl with B-lymphoblastic lymphoma in the maintenance phase of treatment was admitted to hospital with fever and neutrocytopenia, according to the usual diagnostic procedure. Her history was relevant because of symptomatic relatives at the same address who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient had a one-day evolution of cough, but was otherwise asymptomatic on admission, remained afebrile throughout hospitalisation and reported no symptoms of cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, abdominal pain or diarrhoea.
She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab. Infectious disease specialists were consulted and recommended an initial chest X-ray and monitoring of inflammatory markers. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and interleukin 6 were not high and decreased during admission. Ferritin was somewhat elevated at 1098 ng/mL and decreased to 983 ng/mL on a second test. His chest X-ray was normal and his clinical status remained stable; no further X-ray was performed before discharge. Her oral chemotherapy was maintained while she was neutrocytopenic, according to the Children's Oncology Group AALL1131 guidelines and while she was infected with the virus. The patient was discharged after 10 days of hospitalisation. She was retested for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab by PCR three weeks after diagnosis and was negative. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG six weeks after diagnosis was positive, demonstrating that she had generated an immune response while immunosuppressed.
