A 30-year-old man, under psychiatric treatment for several previous suicide attempts, came to the emergency department after taking a Nerium oleander (oleander) shake for self-harm. On arrival one hour after ingestion of the shake, the patient reported vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and altered vision. Gastric lavage was performed and a gastric catheter was placed, which caused the patient to vomit food.
Physical examination: conscious and oriented, blood pressure 50/85 mmHg and heart rate 105 bpm. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. Electrocardiogram with no remarkable or pathological signs except for a slight tachycardia. Haemogram, platelets, coagulation and blood biochemistry normal. Nine hours after ingestion, a digoxin determination was performed at the request of the pharmacy service, the result of which was 0.64 ng/mL.
The patient was admitted for a second digoxin level 24 hours after the first one, with a result of 0.6 ng/mL. From these concentrations, an elimination half-life of 247 hours and a maximum theoretical concentration of 0.66 ng/mL was calculated. During his hospital stay, heart rate was normal as well as biochemistry, haemogram and coagulation. The patient was discharged 24 hours later.
