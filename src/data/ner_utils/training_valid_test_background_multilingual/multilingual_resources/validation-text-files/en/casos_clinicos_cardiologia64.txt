HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A 68-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension, ex-smoker, chronic bronchitis and pulmonary tuberculosis in his youth. He had undergone surgery two years earlier for epigastric hernia and gastric volvulus and one year earlier for abdominal eventration. Two months earlier, he was admitted to Cardiology with a diagnosis of possible acute idiopathic pericarditis, and a recurrence of pass-oesophageal hernia was discovered by chance. His usual treatment was dutasteride 0.5 mg/24h, tamsulosin 0.4/24h, olmesartan 4/12h, salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 mg/24h, diltiazem, clenbuterol and omeprazole.
He was admitted on a scheduled basis for corrective surgery for para-oesophageal hernia with reduction of the herniated stomach, closure of the diaphragmatic pillars, Nissen-type fundoplication and gastropexy.

In the days following surgery, the patient complained of chest pain radiating to the shoulder with dyspnoea and accompanying dysphagia, with no apparent cause. On the eighth postoperative day, the general condition deteriorated significantly, with marked hypotension, chest pain and severe dyspnoea, and the on-call cardiology team was notified.

Physical examination showed hypotension 90/65 mmHg, tachycardia (120 bpm), marked IY at 45o, muffled cardiac tones, crackles in the lung bases, subcutaneous emphysema of the right side and hemiabdomen, MMII oedema.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG: sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm. Axis -30o, BIRDHH. Diffuse ST elevation with AVR descent, PR descent with AVR ascent (compatible with acute pericarditis).
Chest X-ray: significant cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion. CBC: urea 110, Cr 1.78, normal ions, CRP > 9 mg/dl, Hb 10.4, leukocytosis (15300/ul, neutrophilia 88%), plateletopenia 67 000/ul. Coagulation normal. Myocardial damage markers negative. Cholesterol normal. Iron normal. Normal thyroid.
Urgent echocardiogram: circumferential pericardial effusion, 30 mm, collapse of right cavities and tendency to collapse of the left ventricle, alternating valve flows with respiration, compatible with echocardiographic tamponade.

EVOLUTION
He was transferred to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit where percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed, obtaining abundant purulent fluid, sending the corresponding samples for biochemical and microbiological analysis and initiation of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (meropenem + vancomycin). Given the recent history of digestive surgery, a relationship with the current process was suspected and a chest CT scan was requested to rule out the presence of a digestive-pericardial fistula.
CT scan: hydro-aerial level in severe pericardial effusion of about 3 cm circumferentially. After administering oral contrast, no data suggesting the presence of a digestive-pericardial fistula were observed. Bacterial pericarditis, pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema.
Pericardial fluid culture: purulent fluid, with abundant PMN, growth of several microorganisms: Str beta haemolytic group F, Str Viridans, aerobic BGP, BGN. Mycobacterial stains and cultures negative. Antibiogram: sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, resistant to vancomycin).
Control echocardiogram: pericardial constriction, parallel movement of both pericardial leaflets and thickening. Although initially after percutaneous pericardiocentesis there was a significant improvement, it was later observed that the pericardial effusion progressively increased and signs and symptoms of heart failure persisted, so subxiphoid pericardiotomy was performed, draining 200 cc of purulent fluid and fibrin.
Pathological anatomy: chronic fibrous pericarditis with necrohaemorrhagic and purulent internal surface. Large fibroblastic reaction and associated sclerosis. Improvement of the clinical situation and afebrile but in serial echocardiograms increased pericardial effusion in the lateral face progressive increase so cardiac surgery was performed and the pericardium was removed by interphrenic pericardiectomy and drainage of epicardial abscess in the lateral face of the left ventricle and in the right atrium.
Pericardial capsule culture negative. Quantiferon was negative, indicating minimal likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection.

The patient completed several weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment (initially: meropenem 1 g/8h, 3 weeks + vancomycin 1 day and subsequently: imipenem 0.5 g/8h + amikacin 800 mg/24h, 2 weeks). Good evolution and subsequent progressive improvement. In total he was admitted for more than two months. At present the patient is asymptomatic and is leading an active life. On follow-up echocardiograms the pericardial effusion has completely disappeared.

DIAGNOSIS
Recurrence of paraesophageal hernia with Nissen-type surgery.
Acute purulent pericarditis, severe pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
Effusive-constrictive pericarditis.
Evacuative and diagnostic pericardiocentesis.
Subxiphoid pericardiotomy.
Pericardiectomy and drainage of pericardial abscess.
