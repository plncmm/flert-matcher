Anamnesis
The patient was a 67-year-old male, with no relevant family history, no known drug allergies, ex-smoker and drinker of 1-2 glasses of wine a day, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic and had undergone spinal surgery after a traffic accident in his youth (lumbar arthrodesis L2-L3).
Since 2003, he had been under follow-up in urology due to a progressive increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and had up to eight negative biopsies. He was finally diagnosed in November 2013 with combined grade Gleason 6 (3 + 3) prostate adenocarcinoma with two minimal foci in the left lobe and transition zone, stage cT1c. An extension study was completed (thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography [CT] and bone scintigraphy) with no evidence of metastatic disease. He was referred to Radiation Oncology for brachytherapy, which was performed in May 2014 with insertion of 18 vector needles via transperineal route, under ultrasound control and with placement of 63 seeds of very low activity I-125 at prostate level to administer a dose of 145 Gy. Subsequent check-ups every 6 months showed no evidence of progression, with a PSA of less than 1 ng/dl. Prior to this admission, he had undergone a check-up in January 2017, with PSA levels of 0.14 ng/dl.
She came to the emergency department on 20 May 2017 for progressive back pain that had been present for 2 months. The pain was mechanical in nature, worsening with respiratory movements and dorsiflexion of the trunk, and did not radiate. She did not report previous trauma, exertion or any other trigger. There was no pain at other levels. He had no fever or infectious symptoms in the anamnesis by apparatus. He was assessed by Rehabilitation in outpatient consultations, and was awaiting physiotherapy at the time of admission.

Physical examination
"Haemodynamically stable, afebrile. Eupneic. Normal neurological examination, with no evidence of focality. Dorsal-lumbar region with no signs of trauma or haematomas, with scar from arthrodesis sequelae.
"Palpation of the dorsal and lumbar spinous processes was painless, as was palpation of the paravertebral musculature.
"The rest of the physical examination was normal.

Complementary tests
The tests performed during her stay in the emergency department were as follows:
"Blood tests: creatinine and ions normal, C-reactive protein (CRP) 12.3 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 92 mm/h, haemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, leukocytes 9,000 with 85% neutrophilia, platelets 324,000 and no coagulation abnormalities.
"Spinal X-ray: dorsal spondyloarthrosis with numerous osteophytes.
"Angiotomography with protocol for pulmonary thromboembolism: no data suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism. Degenerative changes in the dorsal spine with hypertrophy and flattening of the bodies of the lower dorsal spinous processes and L1, as well as sclerosis of their adjacent edges in relation to interspinous osteoarthritis.

Diagnosis
A diagnosis of dorsalgia was made on investigation.

Treatment
He was kept in observation beds and pain control was attempted with first step analgesics without improvement, so fentanyl patch 12 mcg/h was started, although with inadequate pain control.

Evolution
Finally, it was decided to admit the patient to Internal Medicine for an imaging study (magnetic resonance imaging), given the patient's medical history and the complexity of pain control. The MRI initially reported vertebral metastatic lesions due to prostate carcinoma after finding almost complete involvement of the T4, T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, with extension to the pedicles in T5, the right pedicle in T6 and the T4-T5 joint spine. In addition, there was a finding of a bilateral paravertebral (2 cm) and prevertebral (contacting the aorta and cava without infiltrating them) soft tissue mass. With these findings, an assessment by the Medical Oncology Service was requested.
In the absence of other clear signs of progression with data of absence of disease at the last check-up, a re-evaluation of the images was requested by the Radiology Department with suspicion at this time of probable infectious spondylodiscitis as a possibility in addition to the previous one. A diagnostic biopsy and complementary studies were requested. A bone scan was performed which did not identify metastatic disease and a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scan with no evidence of primary tumour or metastatic disease, both of which were reported as possible spondylodiscitis. PSA within the lower limits of normal.
Core needle biopsy was performed at the T4 level and a sample was sent for culture. The microbiological study was positive for Streptococcus intermedius (which was also isolated in 1‚ÅÑ4 bottles of the blood cultures taken) and with an anatomopathological result compatible with osteomyelitis, with no data of neoplastic disease. In view of these results, antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone according to the antibiogram.
Despite the antibiotic treatment, the clinical evolution was unfavourable, requiring a progressive increase in analgesia, and the patient was haemodynamically stable, afebrile, without leukocytosis and with a decreasing CRP. After 2 weeks of treatment, it was decided to repeat the dorsal MRI to assess the evolution with findings of radiological worsening, T5-T6 disc destruction and the appearance of a phlegmon with small abscesses in the posterior epidural space, causing a small mass effect on the medullary cord and contacting the phlegmon with the wall of the aorta, without affecting it. The patient is currently still in hospital pending evolution and surgical assessment.
