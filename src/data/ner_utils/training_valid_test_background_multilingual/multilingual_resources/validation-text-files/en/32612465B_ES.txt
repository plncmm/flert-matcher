A 58-year-old man with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 6.5%) attended the emergency department on 12 March with cough, dyspnoea and fever of 3 days' evolution. On examination, he presented with fever (39°C) and hypoxaemia, with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. A flu test was negative. A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities. A nasopharyngeal swab sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing by PCR was positive. The patient was admitted and started on ceftriaxone (1 g i.v. daily), azithromycin (500 mg i.v. daily) and hydroxychloroquine (initial dose 800 mg, then 400 mg daily). On 14 March (day 5 of symptomatology), his hypoxaemia worsened despite a reservoir mask, with oxygen saturation dropping to 70%. C-reactive protein was 142 mg/L; ferritin was 2,188 ng/mL. He was transferred to the ICU where he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient met the criteria for severe ARDS, with a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 98. On 22 March he presented with acute kidney injury (AKI), which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). A review of the clinical history revealed no history of chronic kidney disease. Because of the clogged dialysis circuit, the patient was treated with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin. On 23 March, he presented with bilateral pneumothorax, which required placement of a chest drain. His condition worsened despite the measures taken. The patient developed shock resistant to vasopressor therapy and died on 26 March.
