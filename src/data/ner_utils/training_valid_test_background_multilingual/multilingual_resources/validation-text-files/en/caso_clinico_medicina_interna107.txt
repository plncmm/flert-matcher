We present an 83-year-old male with a history of AHT of years of evolution controlled with 4 drugs; type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with oral antidiabetics; ischaemic heart disease (AMI with double bypass in 1986, angioplasty in 2000; and occluded bypass in 2011; anticoagulated atrial fibrillation and rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate and folic acid.
In October 2015, he was admitted for a distal penetrating aortic ulcer and a bifurcated AFX 22-60-40-15 stent was placed and subsequently in December 2015 an Endurant straight tube was implanted inside the previous one due to lack of sealing in the overlapping area.
With this history, she came to the emergency department with a fever of 39oC for a week without shivering, which subsided with antipyretics and anorexia. There were no apparent infectious symptoms. On examination, haemodynamic stability. Conscious and oriented in all 3 spheres. Cardiopulmonary auscultation with no pathological findings. No neck rigidity. Pedial pulse asymmetry with absent left, radial pulses symmetrical. No other findings. Analytically, chronic iron deficiency anaemia with Hb 11.3 g/dl; 8000 leukocytes. Renal function and ions normal. CRP 143 mg/L and PCT 6 ng/ml.
Urine culture was taken (negative) and the first round of blood cultures isolated group viridans streptococcus.
Given this history, PET-CT was requested to rule out infection of the endoprosthesis, which showed an increase in metabolism in the posterior region of the abdominal aortic endoprosthesis compatible with an infectious process. The study was completed with a transthoracic echocardiogram which ruled out infective endocarditis.
Vascular surgery after evaluating the case, given the patient's advanced age together with the rest of the previous comorbidity, ruled out further diagnostic tests and explant of the prosthesis. Thus, they indicated that the only valid treatment in this case was suppressive antibiotic therapy and monitoring in the outpatient department of Vascular Surgery.
In the Infectious Diseases Unit, intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with Piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) for 15 days together with vancomycin for 4 days, and the patient was discharged with home hospitalisation 10 days after admission. After 15 days of treatment with P/T, he was replaced by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg oral indefinitely.
