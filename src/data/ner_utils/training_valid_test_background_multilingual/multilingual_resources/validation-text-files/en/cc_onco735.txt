Oncological history
Male with a personal history at the time of oncological diagnosis of dyslipidaemia in treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg daily, active smoking with an accumulated consumption of 30 pack-years, hepatitis B virus infection in 1998 with no data of subsequent reactivation, gastric ulcer secondary to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and surgical resection of a pilonidal sinus.
His family history includes a mother with breast cancer.
He was diagnosed in October 2013 at the age of 51, following repeated episodes consisting of headache, dizziness and language blockages, of a left parietotemporal brain lesion with mass effect. A biopsy was performed and an anatomopathological diagnosis of grade II astrocytoma with a grade II oligodendroglioma component, negative for 1p/19q deletion, which, according to the latest WHO classification of primary tumours of the central nervous system (2016), is currently considered a grade II astrocytoma. Surgical removal of the lesion was rejected as it was located in an eloquent area and he received radiotherapy treatment, which was completed in January 2014, achieving clinical improvement and radiological stability of the disease, maintained in successive check-ups with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) until June 2017.
On this date, as the patient was asymptomatic, a new MRI scan of the brain was performed, which showed tumour progression at the level of the left frontal lobe, with radiological data suggesting an increase in grade. The case was presented to the neurological tumour committee and a biopsy was scheduled to confirm the grade and subsequent administration of systemic chemotherapy.

Anamnesis
A 55-year-old man with the previously described history came to the emergency department on 30 July 2017 with a speech disturbance of approximately three days' duration, together with deviation of the right oral commissure that had appeared in the last 24 hours.

Physical examination
The patient is haemodynamically stable. There is no jugular engorgement. Cardiopulmonary auscultation shows no alterations. Abdominal examination is normal. There is no oedema in the lower extremities or signs of deep vein thrombosis.
The neurological examination revealed motor aphasia and right central facial paresis, with no other alterations.

Complementary tests
An urgent non-contrast cranial CT scan was performed showing large left frontal vasogenic oedema, probably related to progression of the known lesion, with no other apparent complications.

Diagnosis
Clinical and radiological progression, with large left cerebral vasogenic oedema, of grade II cerebral astrocytoma.

Treatment
Given the clinical repercussions of tumour progression, with the presence of significant vasogenic oedema, intravenous corticosteroid treatment was started with dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg every 6 hours.

Evolution
The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Department for close clinical monitoring and a new MRI scan of the brain, which showed tumour progression at the left frontal subcortical level, with high-grade radiological data, and was accompanied by significant vasogenic oedema and mass effect on the convexity sulci and midline.
During admission, the patient's clinical evolution was favourable, with a gradual decrease in the dose of corticoids. At the time of discharge, he was in good functional condition, with an ECOG score of 0.
From the oncological point of view, given the radiological findings of progression with an increase in grade and the short interval neurological worsening, it was decided not to perform a brain biopsy and to start chemotherapy treatment with temozolamide at a dose of 150 mg/m2 orally for 5 days (total dose: 280 mg) every 28 days. On 07/08/2017 the first cycle was started with good tolerance.
The disease was re-evaluated after four cycles of treatment, with brain MRI showing the resolution of practically all the vasogenic oedema and disappearance of the frontal lesions present in the previous MRI. Given the favourable radiological response, treatment continued with temozolamide at the same dose, receiving a total of seven cycles, the last on 07/03/2018. During this period of time, the patient was clinically asymptomatic except for a slight episode of dizziness and no adverse reactions to temozolamide.
However, since the administration of the last course of temozolamide, the patient showed significant clinical deterioration, with impaired speech and handwriting. Treatment was started with dexamethasone 2 mg every 12 hours orally and a new MRI was requested (09/04/2018) which showed extensive tumour progression, mainly at the level of the inferior convexity and the sylvian opercular structures. Once the progression was confirmed, a second line of treatment with fotemustine was started, with the first cycle being received on 10/04/2018. The patient is currently asymptomatic and is awaiting consultation for clinical and toxicity monitoring.
