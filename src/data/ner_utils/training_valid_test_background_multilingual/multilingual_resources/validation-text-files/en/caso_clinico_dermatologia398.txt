Anamnesis
Poisoning by lionfish (Pterois volitans) is an exceptional reason for consultation in the Emergency Department in our country. However, its presence in domestic aquariums is becoming more and more common, so it is important to know the clinical picture and management of this poisoning in order to avoid potentially dangerous complications.
A 34-year-old man with no medical or surgical history of interest came to the emergency department after having punctured the third finger of his right hand with a lionfish spine one hour earlier. The puncture occurred while he was cleaning the home aquarium where the fish was kept. Immediately after the puncture, he began to experience intense pain and oedema at the level of this finger, which rapidly progressed to the distal third of the arm. He had no nausea, vomiting or other systemic symptoms, and was haemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed significant oedema of the right hand, as well as the presence of a poorly demarcated cyanotic area on the thumb of the third finger of the right hand. No remnants of spines, active bleeding or other puncture sites were observed. There was no other evidence of local infection. Pulses were palpable at all levels and the patient retained both active and passive mobility of the hand joints.

Additional tests
An urgent blood count, haemogram, haemostasis and basic biochemistry were normal.

Diagnosis
Lionfish poisoning.

Treatment
Analgesia was prescribed with pethidine 50 mg subcutaneously and washings in water at 50oC with povidone iodine soap. As the patient could not remember whether he had completed the correct tetanus prophylaxis, a booster dose was administered.

Evolution
After intermittent immersion in warm water for 120 minutes the patient reported great improvement in pain. As he had remained stable during observation in the ED, discharge with recommendations and symptomatic treatment was decided. One week later, the patient was re-evaluated and showed only a superficial scab on the thumb of the third finger, with no associated areas of necrosis or loss of substance.
