Anamnesis
A 41-year-old man with no history of interest or previous headaches consulted for acute headache of five days' evolution. He described it as predominantly bitemporal, intense, pulsating, non-explosive and associated with cervical pain, which mainly appeared when standing upright, with the addition of presyncopal symptoms and vomiting, with clear improvement when lying down. The previous days he had presented a catarrhal condition, and the patient reported that the only possible trigger for the headache was having been performing forced nasal cleansing manoeuvres moments before the onset of the clinical picture.

Physical examination
The patient was afebrile and the general examination was unremarkable, except for a slight final nuchal rigidity, with no other signs of meningeal irritation. The neurological examination showed no findings of interest. The patient's intolerance to sitting and standing was striking, such that a few minutes after leaving the decubitus position, a sensation of dizziness with intense vaso-vagal symptoms accompanied the headache described.

Complementary tests
- A basic blood test and an electrocardiogram were ordered in the emergency department, as well as a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed no alterations.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angio-MRI performed during admission only showed sphenoidal and left maxillary sinusitis.
- Given the clear relationship between the clinical picture and the orthostatism, liquor hypotension syndrome was suspected, and a lumbar puncture was performed which showed severe hypotension of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which did not flow except after Valsalva manoeuvres.
- At the same time, the study was completed with an isotopic cisternography, which finally confirmed the presence of several fistulous tracts of cerebrospinal cerebrospinal fluid at the upper thoracic and lower cervical levels, with marked delay in the progression of the tracer, all congruent with a severe liquor hypotension syndrome secondary to multiple dural fistula.

Treatment and evolution
Given the diagnosis of severe liquor hypotension syndrome, symptomatic measures were adopted consisting of absolute bed rest and analgesic therapy. Serum therapy with hyperosmolar solutions was started and caffeine was added to the diet to treat the hypotension. The patient showed a very good clinical evolution, progressively tolerating sitting and standing, with gradual disappearance of the headache and vegetative symptoms, which is why it was decided to continue with conservative measures at home after discharge from hospital.

Diagnosis
Severe cerebrospinal fluid hypotension syndrome, secondary to spontaneous cervico-dorsal dural fistula, triggered by the Valsalva manoeuvre.
