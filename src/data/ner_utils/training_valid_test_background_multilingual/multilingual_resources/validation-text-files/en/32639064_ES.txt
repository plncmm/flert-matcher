A 65-year-old Malaysian man presented to the emergency department with acute lethargy during the last week, which he initially attributed to Ramadan fasting. For the past two days, he was nauseated and vomited small amounts of non-bilious, non-hemorrhagic gastric contents twice daily during the fast, but reported no diarrhoea or abdominal pain. She reported no fever or respiratory symptoms. 
His family doctor found leukocytopenia in his blood tests and referred him to the emergency department. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was in good health and working full time. His only medication was allopurinol 100 mg per day orally for gout prevention. 
Otherwise, he had no relevant medical or family history. He did not take supplements, was a teetotaller and had never smoked. On examination, he was afebrile and haemodynamically stable, with no need for oxygen, but his oral mucosa was dry. Neurological, respiratory and abdominal examination were normal and the patient was clinically euthyroid. Laboratory tests revealed severe hyponatraemia (sodium concentration 115 mmol/L), increased markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, 29.5 mg/L) and leukocytopenia (total leukocyte count, 1.8x109/L). Serum creatinine, urea, potassium and bicarbonate concentrations were null, and the patient was neither anaemic nor thrombocytopenic. The elevated C-reactive protein value and leukocytopenia prompted a search for the source of infection and, consequently, a chest X-ray was performed which revealed patchy alveolar opacities in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung, indicative of community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, he was isolated on the pulmonology ward and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was positive. In contrast, PCR for atypical organisms, such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Bordetella, was negative. As the patient had no cough, we were unable to collect sputum for testing. 
 Additional tests were performed to determine the cause of the severe hyponatraemia. A thyroid function test revealed a low thyroid stimulating hormone concentration at 0.221 mIU/L, a normal free T4 value at 12.86 pmol/L and an undetectable free T3 value (< 2.0 mcg/dL). A rapid tetracosactrin (Synacthen) test performed at 08:00 showed an adequate adrenal response (299 nmol/L at 0 min; 630 nmol/L at 30 min; 834 nmol/L at 60 min). Blood and urine tests gave no indication of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIHAD, serum osmolarity 256 mOsm/kg; urine osmolarity 83 mOsm/kg; natriuria, < 20 mmol/mL). The patient was seen by an endocrinologist, who diagnosed severe hypovolaemic hyponatraemia and euthyroid patient syndrome. Diagnosed with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, the patient was transferred to the COVID-19 isolation ward. The patient received an interim treatment of oral amoxicillin (875 mg) with clavulanate (125 mg, Augmentine) twice daily and doxycycline (100 mg) twice daily for seven days. To treat severe hypovolaemic hyponatraemia, the patient was hydrated with an i.v. isotonic saline infusion and serum sodium concentration increased from 115 to 127 mmol/L in one day and then to 132 mmol/L in four days. Subsequently, his lethargy, vomiting and nausea subsided. As the patient remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable, with no need for oxygen, he was not treated with antivirals. On the eighth day after admission, the patient was discharged and transferred to a quarantine facility.
