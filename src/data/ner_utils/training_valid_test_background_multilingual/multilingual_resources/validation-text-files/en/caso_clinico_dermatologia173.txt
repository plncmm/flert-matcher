Anamnesis
Patient aged 46 years, from Morocco, with no known drug allergies or relevant pathological history.
She was seen in the emergency department for symptoms compatible with cellulitis in the left lower limb which, according to the patient, started 5 days after being bitten by a spider. She had been assessed by the primary care physician who prescribed treatment with oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and clindamycin), despite which the lesion followed a torpid course with progressive enlargement and the appearance of a central necrotic area, associated with an increase in the volume of the limb and marked pain and functional impotence.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed enlargement of the left thigh and an intensely inflammatory plaque approximately 15 cm in diameter with a central necrotic eschar measuring 3 x 2 cm. Smaller inflammatory plaques were also seen proximally following a lymphatic pathway.

Complementary examinations
Emergency laboratory tests showed: C-reactive protein 12.6 mg/dL, leukocyte count 12,000/ml, neutrophil count 11,000/ml, platelet count 283,000/ml and haemoglobin 12.6 g/dL. All other analytical parameters including creatinemia, LDH, creatine kinase, electrolytes and coagulation were normal. Microbiological culture of the ulcerated area of the lesion was negative.

Diagnosis
Cutaneous loxoscelism due to the bite of a spider of the genus Loxosceles rufescens.

Treatment
An uncomplicated scarectomy was performed and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with intravenous ertapenem.

Evolution
During her admission the patient remained afebrile and in good general condition, although the skin lesion evolved torpidly with central ulceration and the presence of abundant purulent exudation. After two weeks, the lesion began to evolve favourably, with a significant decrease in inflammation and exudate, and she was discharged from the hospital. Repeated microbiological cultures were performed during admission, which were always negative. The patient followed periodic dressings for 6 weeks with complete resolution of the lesion.
