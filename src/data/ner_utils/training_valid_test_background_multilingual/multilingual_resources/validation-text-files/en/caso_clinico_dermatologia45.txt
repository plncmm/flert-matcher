We present the case of a 38-year-old woman, with no personal or family history of interest, who had been a fishmonger since the age of 17. She came to the emergency department with generalised pruritus and confluent haemorrhagic lesions all over the body, requiring high doses of corticosteroids and antihistamines to stop them. One month later, the same symptoms recurred, this time accompanied by polyarthralgia and stiffness, especially in the knees and ankles, with a good response to indomethacin. In the anamnesis, the patient reported occasional consumption of undercooked fish, with no history of abdominal pain. Blood tests were performed to determine haemogram, glucose, renal function, ions, transaminases, bilirubin, CRP, rheumatoid factor and autoimmunity study, all with values within the normal range. The skin test for various foods (dairy products, fish and nuts) was negative, but positive for Anisakis, with Anisakis-specific IgE of 99.2 IUI/ml (normal value: 0-0.35 IUI/ml). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed with no notable pathological findings, and no parasites were visualised.

She was advised not to eat any type of fish, despite which the clinical picture recurred every time she handled fish or even the clothes and equipment used in the fishmonger's, with the symptoms improving dramatically when exposure ceased. The patient was placed on temporary incapacity for work, which was eventually converted to total permanent incapacity, and has not shown any new episodes since the cessation of exposure to fish.

Anisakis simplex is a nematode, described to parasitise fish, with man being an intermediate host, showing a worldwide distribution.

In the case presented, exposure to Anisakis manifested itself in an atypical way, with severe and extensive skin involvement, with habonosis and vasculitic lesions, as well as polyarthralgias with involvement of the knees and ankles, with no relation to fish intake, the latter aspect being the main reason for the delay in diagnosis.
