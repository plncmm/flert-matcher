A 51 year old patient, with no past history of interest, who had started to progressively develop in the last few days with decline, instability and dysarthria. An urgent CT scan was performed which revealed a lesion in the left thalamus with perilesional oedema. Clinical and analytical data were reviewed and only discrete neutrophilia was observed, and an MRI was completed. The MRI showed a thalamic lesion of irregular contours with ring-shaped contrast uptake and significant diffusion restriction, which suggested the diagnosis of intracranial abscess. The absence of infectious symptoms, the practically nondescript laboratory tests and the fact that the patient was immunocompetent with no history of brain surgery led the clinicians to doubt the diagnosis, and they were more inclined towards a tumour lesion. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed and two days later the CT scan was repeated, showing a significant increase in size. The patient underwent surgery and the presence of purulent material was confirmed, with a negative AP result and the origin was not found.
