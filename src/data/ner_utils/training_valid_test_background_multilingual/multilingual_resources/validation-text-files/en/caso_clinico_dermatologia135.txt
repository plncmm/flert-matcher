Anamnesis
A 32-year-old woman with no personal history of interest consulted for a rash in the pubic region of one month's evolution that was initially pruritic and had become painful with occasional suppuration. She had no other systemic symptoms except for an occasional dystrophic sensation. She did not relate the process to previous triggers, although in the anamnesis she mentioned that a month before the onset of the symptoms she had given birth vaginally, at which time she was shaved.
She had no animals at home or contact with them, although her husband did. She denied risky sexual relations.
She had been treated empirically with a combination of topical betamethasone and fusidic acid, acyclovir cream and topical ciclopirox, without any improvement.

Physical examination
Congestive erythematous oedematous plaque, indurated, hot, with nodules and follicular pustules inside, covering the entire mons pubis to the vulvar fork, extending to the left inguinal region and hypogastrium. On the buttocks there were annular plaques of 2.5 cm (right) and 1 cm (left) in diameter with raised peripheral papules and desquamation. Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies were palpable, reddish, painful, small in size.
On being informed of the suspected diagnosis, the husband showed circinate, scaly plaques on the dorsum of the right hand, forearm and side, as well as some papules in the pubic region, which did not coalesce into a plaque.

Additional examinations
A culture of hair from the patient's pubic plaque and a culture of scales from the dorsum of her husband's hand were requested. Microscopic examination of the colonies revealed numerous thin-walled spherical microconidia grouped in clusters, spherical chlamydospores, spiral hyphae and thin-walled multi-tabulate macroconidia, and the species Trichophyton mentagrophytes was identified as responsible for the picture. A punch biopsy of a pustule on the mons pubis showed a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate forming granulomas located in the reticular dermis and hypodermis, with occasional neutrophils and eosinophils, but no evidence of fungal structures.

Diagnosis
Majocchi's granuloma (and tinea corporis in her husband).

Treatment
Treatment was started with oral terbinafine 250 mg daily and ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours for both. Treatment was also associated with topical ciclopirox olamine.

Evolution
After 4 weeks of treatment, the plaque on the mons pubis had significantly reduced in size and showed a residual appearance, while the gluteal plaques had completely resolved. It was decided to extend treatment for up to 8 weeks with complete resolution of the condition, although a 2.5 cm area of residual alopecia persisted.
The husband's lesions had resolved after 4 weeks, at which point it was decided to end treatment.
