We present the case of a 5-year-old girl from Guinea, resident in Spain for 9 months, who came to the emergency department for progressive pain in the left thigh with swelling, oedema and functional impotence of 10 days' evolution. He was associated with asthenia, unquantified weight loss and non-thermometric febrile sensation for the last 2 weeks. Physical examination revealed a painful, non-fluctuating inflammatory swelling measuring 6 x 6 cm in diameter on the anterior aspect of the left thigh, painful bilateral inguinal lymph nodes measuring 2 x 2 cm in diameter, and a painless, fluctuating subcutaneous nodule measuring 3 x 3 cm in diameter in the left hemiabdomen. A basic blood test was performed in the emergency department and the haemogram showed: red blood cells, 4,900,000/μl; haemoglobin, 11.6 g/dl; haematocrit, 35.2 %; leukocytes, 13,300/μl (neutrophils, 54.8 %; monocytes, 6.4 %; lymphocytes, 32.6 %; eosinophils, 4.8 %); platelets, 494. 000/μl; normal biochemical study (CPK, 59 I/l) and a blood culture was performed, which was reported as sterile, and an ultrasound scan of the left thigh showed destructured muscle fibres. Given the suspicion of tropical pyomyositis, it was decided to admit the patient to hospital. Antibiotic treatment was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid intravenously for 15 days, and then oral treatment was completed on an outpatient basis for a further 10 days. During his admission, a microbiological study was completed, determining positive serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV), positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Plasmodium falciparum, and Trichiuris trichura and Ascaris lumbricoides were isolated in stool culture. Surgical drainage of the abscess in the left hemiabdomen was necessary, and S. aureus was isolated. The patient evolved favourably, the fever subsided after 48 h and the inflammatory signs progressively decreased until the patient fully recovered the functional capacity of the affected limb.

As occurred in our patient, and although the aetiopathogenesis of tropical pyomyositis is not perfectly established, according to many authors there is an initially localised infection which, if not adequately treated, would spread via haematogenous or lymphatic routes, forming metastatic septic abscesses. The cause of this possible dissemination is not clearly defined, but it has been related to tropical diseases such as filariasis, malaria, Dracunculus medinensis, etc., which could cause an imbalance in the immune system with a local immunoglobulin E response to certain parasitic infections with a polarisation of the immune system towards Th2.
