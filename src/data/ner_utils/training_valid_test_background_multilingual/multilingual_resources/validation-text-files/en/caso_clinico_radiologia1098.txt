A 6-year-old male patient with no history of morbidity, up to date immunisations, with adequate weight gain and psychomotor development. He presented with upper respiratory symptoms of 3 weeks' evolution, without fever. Three days prior to consultation, there was a history of moderate periumbilical abdominal pain, repeated vomiting, and the day before consultation, vertigo, diplopia and gait ataxia. Neurological examination revealed slow speech, multidirectional nystagmus, symmetrically diminished tone and reflexes, with normal strength, positive Romberg and ataxic gait. Lesions compatible with chickenpox were found, some of which were crusting on the face and scalp.

Diagnosis

Acute post-infectious cerebellitis (CAPI).

A CT scan of the brain was performed on admission, which showed a hypodense lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with a slight mass effect on the fourth ventricle. It was complemented with MRI which identified the same lesion with hyperintensity in sequences with long TR (especially in FLAIR) and significantly reinforced with the use of intravenous gadolinium.

Given physical examination findings with lesions compatible with chickenpox, intravenous treatment was started with Acyclovir 500 mg/m2 every 8 hours. The patient's clinical course was favourable and symptoms resolved. He was discharged on the ninth day of hospitalisation, completing nine days of intravenous treatment with Acyclovir, with indication to complete 14 days of oral treatment with 500 mg every 12 hours on the remaining days. A follow-up MRI scan was performed 10 days after discharge, which showed persistence of the lesion described, with a slight decrease in the inflammatory pattern. A new outpatient check-up was performed one month after discharge, with MRI showing significant regression of the lesion.

MRI of the brain performed 10 and 30 days after the onset of cerebellar symptoms. In the first check-up, a slight decrease in the size of the lesion was observed, which was barely perceptible in the later check-up. This evolution supports the diagnosis of acute post-infectious cerebellitis.
