A 20-year-old male, referred in December 2017 to the Internal Medicine department for vasculitic skin lesions on both lower limbs and generalised arthromyalgia, without fever. He had asthenia, without hyporexia or weight loss. Physical education student, sporadic contact with young children, denies other epidemiological history of interest. On physical examination, there were petechial purpuric lesions between 1 mm and 5 mm in size, which did not blanch on pressure in both lower extremities, both on the anterior and posterior face, and also in the tenar region of the right hand, with no palmo-plantar involvement or other lesions; no signs of arthritis. The rest of the examination was normal. General laboratory tests, including hepatobiliary profile and urine, were normal, except for CPK 334 with normal LDH and aldolase. TSH, ACE, ASLO, RF, autoimmunity (ANAs, ANCAs, ANOEs) and cryoglobulins were negative, Proteinogram, immunoglobulins and complement were normal. Serologies: EBV, CMV, Toxoplasma. HIV and HCV negative, AgHBs neg, AcHBc neg, AcAntiHBs + 112.3 (vaccinated hepatitis B with adequate immunity). Brucella, Borrelia, Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia conori negative, Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and IgM negative, Parvovirus B19 IgM +, IgG negative. A skin biopsy showed mild non-specific chronic superficial dermatitis without associated vascular damage, with superficial haematic extravasation, which could be compatible with a vasculitic process in the process of resolution. With symptomatic treatment, relative rest and NSAIDs, the evolution was good. Awaiting clinical and serological evolution. No other familial cases have been detected.
