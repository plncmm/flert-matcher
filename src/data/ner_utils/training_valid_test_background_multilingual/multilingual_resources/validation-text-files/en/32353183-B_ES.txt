A 75-year-old man with no concomitant diseases presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting of two days' duration, together with a worsening of the cough and dyspnoea he had been suffering from for two weeks. On admission, his oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, but all other manifestations were within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without ischaemic alterations. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (18.1 x 109/L), lymphocytopenia (0.9 x 109/L) and mild thrombocytosis (497 x 109/L). The D-dimer value was high (3.2 mg/L), but troponin T and renal and hepatic functional indicators were normal. Chest X-ray indicated the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CT angiography showed an intravascular thrombus in the descending aorta with embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, but no signs of atherosclerosis.
Catheter thrombolysis was started, but the patient showed worsening abdominal symptoms and a laparotomy was performed, with resection of 150 cm of ischaemic small bowel.
