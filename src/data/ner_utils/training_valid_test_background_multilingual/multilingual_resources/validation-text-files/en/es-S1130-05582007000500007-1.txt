The patient is a 38 year old male who came to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, referred from another centre, due to a mandibular tumour that had been present for 1 year.

His pathological history included being a former injecting drug addict, HCV positive and HIV positive on antiretroviral treatment. Examination revealed a right mandibular tumour approximately 5 cm in size, fixed and hard in consistency, with the oral mucosa remaining intact. The orthopantomography showed a mixed lesion with calcifications in its interior affecting the right hemimandible.

The CT scan showed an expansive mixed lesion in the body of the right mandible that destroyed the cortices measuring 4.5x3x3.3 cm.

The biopsy performed showed a calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour.
The patient underwent a right hemimandibulectomy with microsurgical fibula reconstruction.

Pathological anatomy revealed a mass measuring 4 x 2.5 cm with an irregular surface, heterogeneous appearance, congestive areas and remnants of teeth, which confirmed the diagnosis of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour of the mandible infiltrating periosteal soft tissues. The mentonian nerve did not show invasion and the intraoperative biopsy of the left facial chain ganglion did not show metastasis.

The postoperative evolution was favourable and he was discharged tolerating diet and with wound control in the outpatient department.
