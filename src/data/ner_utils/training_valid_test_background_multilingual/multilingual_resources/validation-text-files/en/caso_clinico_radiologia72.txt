A 24-year-old woman with a history of bicuspid aortic valve with aortic stenosis operated on in childhood who underwent a new operation at the age of 22 to replace the aortic valve with a mechanical prosthesis and a Dacron tube. She came to the emergency department one year later due to febrile peaks and epigastric pain. Angio-CT was performed, showing small images suggestive of thrombi adhering to the aortic wall, affecting the segment occupied by the supracoronary tube (Fig.1). Three days later, despite anticoagulant treatment, there was a worsening of the condition and two new CT angiograms were performed, showing an increase in the size and number of thrombotic material adhering to the wall (Fig.2). It was decided to perform urgent surgery, and the patient died during the operation. The biological material present inside the prosthesis was sent to Microbiology, and Aspergillus Flavus was isolated.
