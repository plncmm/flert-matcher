Anamnesis
A 30-year-old woman with a history of uncomplicated right renal colic 5 years previously. She had no other medical or surgical history. Allergic to ciprofloxacin.
She was referred to our clinic for the study of recurrent episodes of voiding syndrome during the last 6 months. The patient describes the symptoms as pollakiuria, dysuria and urgency, sometimes accompanied by fever and pain in the right renal fossa. The symptoms improve only partially with anti-inflammatory treatment. She provided several urine cultures, all of which were negative. Five years earlier, an intravenous urography had been performed in the context of right renal colic, with no findings.

Physical examination
Good general condition. Afebrile. Blood pressure 128/85 mmHg. Abdomen soft and depressible, without masses or megaliths. Body mass index 26. Some discomfort to the right renal fist percussion. Rest of the examination with no findings.

Complementary tests
- Haemogram and biochemistry: no alterations.
- Urine sediment: pH: 6. Isolated leucocyturia without haematuria or bacteriuria.
- Serial urine cultures: negative.
- Bacilloscopy with BAAR staining: negative.
- Chest-abdomen X-ray: no findings.
- Urological ultrasound: grade I ureterohydronephrosis in the right urinary tract. The situation, size and echostructure of both kidneys are normal. No space-occupying lesions were observed. Bladder of good capacity with no findings. Normal internal genitalia.
- Urine cytology: intense inflammatory signs, with no cellularity suggestive of malignancy.
- Intravenous urography: when compared with the previous one, from 5 years earlier, the complete functional annulment of the right kidney with no objective cause was observed. The left kidney was normal.
- Diuretic renogram: total absence of right renal function and normal left renal function.
- Cystoscopy: normal bladder mucosa. No space-occupying lesions. Orthotopic ureteral meatus.
- Right ascending pyelography: normal pyeloureteral morphology with no signs suggesting obstruction.

Diagnosis
The patient was a young woman with chronic voiding syndrome, negative urine cultures and functional annulment of the right kidney with no objective cause. Given the sediment findings (sterile pyuria), and despite negative BAAR staining, a specific urine culture for mycobacteria in Lowestein-Jensen medium was requested. At 6 weeks, we were informed of the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Although more sensitive than smear microscopy, culture on tubercle bacillus specific medium has the disadvantage of very slow growth (6-8 weeks).

Treatment
The treatment regimen for respiratory tuberculosis is superimposable for genitourinary disease. There is no ideal treatment regimen and depending on the patient's symptoms, co-morbidity and adherence to treatment, one treatment regimen or another may be chosen1 . According to the bacteriological basis, the recommended treatment regimen in Spain is 6 months, with four first-line drugs for the first 2 months (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) and two drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin) for the remaining 4 months (2HRZE/4HR). The indication to add ethambutol to all patients is established to cover possible resistance. However, the same regimen without ethambutol is still valid for most TB patients born in Spain1. For this reason, and due to its potential nephrotoxicity, it was decided to prescribe the ethambutol-free regimen in our patient, starting with a combined preparation of isoniazid 120 mg, pyrazinamide 300 mg and rifampicin 50 mg divided into three daily doses (2-2-1) for 2 months (2HRZ induction phase). After this period, the maintenance phase was continued for 4 months with daily single doses of another combination of isoniazid 300 mg, rifampicin 600 mg (4HR) and vitamin B6 50 mg (the latter is included in the same preparation as prophylaxis against the potential neurotoxicity of isoniazid).

Evolution
During antituberculosis treatment, it is essential to establish regular controls with a triple objective: to check the efficacy of the medication, to stimulate correct compliance and to discover drug toxicity early on. The most frequent and dangerous side effect of treatment is liver toxicity. In our case, we scheduled controls every 2 months, which included liver enzyme and renal function tests, and the collection of two urine samples from the first morning urination (for smear microscopy and culture, respectively). Microbiological monitoring was continued until completion of one year of follow-up. The result of all controls was negative and tolerance and adherence to treatment were optimal.
Despite an adequate response to medical treatment, the pain in the right renal fossa persisted recurrently with moderate intensity. Therefore, and given the lack of functionality of this renal unit, laparoscopic nephrectomy was proposed. Ureteral exeresis is not mandatory and it is accepted that medical therapy is capable of sterilising the residual ureter. During the operation, the marked adhesions of the perirenal tissues, frequently described in these cases, were striking, although they did not pose major surgical problems. The anatomopathological study of the specimen confirmed renal atrophy compatible with previous tuberculous infection.
Four years after nephrectomy, the patient is asymptomatic, maintains good renal function with creatinine levels of 0.9 mg/dl and has had a full-term pregnancy without problems.
