Anamnesis
A 57-year-old male, previously healthy, came for urgent consultation due to a painful lesion on the dorsum of the nose of five days' evolution. He denied trauma or bites in the area. The initial lesion was a pink, inflammatory and painful plaque that later developed small pustules, some of them with whitish exudation. He also reported bilateral frontotemporal headache. He maintained a good general condition with no fever at all times.

Physical examination
Good general condition, afebrile and normotensive. Examination of the lesion showed an erythematous oedematous plaque with the appearance of orange peel extensively occupying the nasal dorsum, and over it multiple monomorphous pustules of 1 mm not grouped together and an irregular area of 10 mm eroded with blackish crust adherent. There were no similar lesions on the rest of the face and no locoregional lymphadenopathies were palpable.

Complementary examinations
Blood tests showed normal haemogram, biochemistry, coagulation and acute phase reactants and negative antinuclear antibodies. Bacterial culture and smear microscopy of a skin biopsy were negative. Histopathological examination showed a diffuse mixed dermal interstitial and follicular inflammatory infiltrate (A) with massive exocytosis of the follicular epithelium (C) and extension into the subcutaneous cellular tissue, keratinocyte mass necrosis and small vessel vasculitis with leukocytoclasia and fibrinoid necrosis. Herpes virus-like cytopathic changes were observed in the keratinocytes of the follicular epithelium (B, D) with extension into the sebaceous glands (B). Cytopathic changes consisted of intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions, multinucleated keratinocytes, ground-glass cytoplasm and necrotic remnants of keratinocytes.
Finally, PCR for herpes virus was positive for Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). In addition, blood serology was positive for VZV compatible with ongoing infection and negative for HSV, HIV, hepatotropic virus and syphilis.

Diagnosis
Necrotizing herpetic folliculitis due to VZV.

Treatment
Initially, empirical treatment with topical mupirocin together with intravenous cefazolin and ceftriaxone was performed with a slight decrease in inflammation. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, treatment was started with oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times a day at 4-hour intervals, omitting the night dose, for 7 days.

Evolution
The patient showed an excellent evolution with complete resolution of the skin lesions after two weeks of follow-up. However, the patient reported more or less persistent headache, sometimes pulsating, without alarm data and with poor response to paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She is currently being monitored by the neurology department with a diagnosis of postherpetic cranial neuralgia. She has improved with the administration of amitriptyline 10-20mg daily at night and eslicarbamacepine 200mg daily in the mornings. In addition, a curious finding was that her adolescent daughter developed classic chickenpox a week after the diagnosis of herpetic folliculitis, probably due to paternal transmission.
