63-year-old man from Iquique, administrative worker in a mining company, with a history of hypertension, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia, on treatment with valsartan and metformin. He was a non-smoker.

He initially consulted for cough, odynophagia and myalgias, which was treated as acute bronchitis, with good clinical response. Five weeks later, plasma creatinine (Cr) of 3.07 mg/dL and microscopic haematuria were detected, so RPGN was suspected and he was referred for hospitalisation.

He was admitted with normal vital signs, no oxygen requirements, no oedema and no findings on pulmonary examination. Laboratory tests reported haemoglobin (Hb) 14 g/dL, leucocytes 7620/uL, platelets 373000/uL, Cr 2.5 mg/dL, BUN 29 mg/dL, sodium (Na) 143 mEq/L, potassium (K) 5.4 mEq/L, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) by ELISA (-), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (-), anti-streptolysin antibodies (ASO) (-), normal complement C3 and C4, hepatitis B and C virus (-), HIV (-). Urine examination showed 40-50 red blood cells/field with 40% acanthocytes and proteinuria/creatininuria index (PCI) 0.6g/g. Renal function deteriorated slightly to a maximum Cr 3.09 mg/dL, without requiring dialysis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed peribronchial ground-glass opacities and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 88% macrophages with 98% haemosiderophages, compatible with alveolar haemorrhage. The infectious study of the BAL was negative. Anti-GBM antibodies were measured by ELISA in blood and were positive at 60.2 AU/mL (normal value < 12 AU/mL). Renal biopsy was performed and reported predominantly cellular crescentic lesions with weak linear and focal reactivity for IgG1 and IgG3 (negative for IgA, IgG4 and C3) on immunofluorescence, compatible with GBAMD. He was treated with 11 sessions of plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone 3.0 g, and then maintenance therapy with cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone, achieving negativation of anti-GBM antibodies, good clinical response and improvement of renal function until Cr at discharge of 1.87 mg/dL.

Subsequently, she was kept under monthly clinical control where adequate clinical evolution was observed, progressively decreasing corticosteroids and improving renal function with Cr up to 1.5 mg/dL, Hb 12.3 g/dL and maintaining negative anti-GBM antibodies until one week after the end of treatment with cyclophosphamide.

Two weeks after completing treatment with cyclophosphamide for 3 months, while on prednisone and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci, a one-week course of myalgias, fever, haemoptotic cough and progressive dyspnoea began. The following tests were ordered: Hb 11 g/dL, leukocytes 12,720/uL, platelets 366,000/uL, Cr 2.27 mg/dL, Na 142 mEq/L and K 4.4 mEq/L, and chest X-ray: bilateral multifocal alveolar filling. He was hospitalised and treated as multilobar pneumonia with ceftazidime 1g c/12 h and vancomycin 1 g c/72 h. However, in 48 h he evolved. However, within 48 h he progressed with ventilatory deterioration, increased cough and acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Cotrimoxazole was added and he was transferred with invasive mechanical ventilation by ambulance to our hospital due to suspicion of recurrence.

He was admitted with severe hypoxaemia with PaFI < 200, with the following exams: lactate 0.8 mmol/L, Hb 7.7 g/dL, Cr 2.9 mg/dL, BUN 32 mg/dL, normal plasma electrolytes, calcium 7.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 7 mg/dL, albumin 2.8 g/dL. Fibrobronchoscopy with LBA showed blood in the airway, 40% macrophages with 36% haemosiderophages, with negative microbiological study. Prior to plasmapheresis, anti-GBM antibodies were requested by ELISA techniques in blood and by multiple flow immunoassay, which were negative. The same sample was negative by immunoassay at the Mayo Clinic.

Due to the suspected recurrence of GBAMD, it was decided to treat empirically with 9 sessions of plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone 3 g, 2 doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (800 mg), associated with immunoglobulin supplementation and cryoprecipitate (due to hypofibrinogenemia secondary to plasmapheresis), and haemodialysis sessions due to oliguric renal failure with maximum Cr 6.6 mg/dL. Subsequently, oral therapy with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day and high-dose prednisone was continued.

During hospitalisation, anti-GBM antibodies were measured repeatedly by ELISA and were always negative. In addition, ANA, ANCA, anti-myeloperoxidase and anti-myeloperoxidase 3 antibodies by ELISA and anti-scl70 were requested and all were negative.

The patient responded favourably to therapy, without new episodes of haemoptysis, achieving extubation and suspension of oxygen therapy, with progressive improvement in renal function until reaching Cr 2.0 mg/dL, with haemodialysis being suspended prior to discharge.

Currently, 9 months later, he remains in good general condition, on treatment with prednisone and azathioprine. Latest tests (August 2018): Cr 1.58 mg/dL, urine test with IPC 283 mg/g, 2-4 erythrocytes/field with 2% acanthocytes, and anti-GBM antibodies < 3.0 AU/mL.
