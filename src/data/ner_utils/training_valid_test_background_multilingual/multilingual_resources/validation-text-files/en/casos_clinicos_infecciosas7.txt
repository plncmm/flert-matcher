We present the case of a 63-year-old woman who came to the emergency department with a fever of 5 days' evolution in the form of fever peaks, 2 to 3 per day, reaching temperatures of up to 40oC, associated with general malaise, nausea with vomiting coinciding with ingestion and diarrhoeal stools without pathological products.

Her medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone 5mg/24h and azathioprine 50mg/12h, at the present time, and no recent history of outbreaks, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. The patient was specifically asked about any epidemiological history of interest, denying contact with animals, recent travel and risky sexual practices. On examination the patient was drowsy, although conscious and oriented, with dry skin and mucous membranes, hypotensive (70/40 mmHg), tachypnoea at 36 rpm maintaining SpO2 98% baseline, rhythmic at 75 bpm with normal cardiorespiratory auscultation.

Examination by apparatus and systems revealed pain on palpation in the right hypochondrium, with no defence or peritonism and no palpable megaliths, as well as minimal bimalleolar oedema in the lower limbs.

Initial laboratory studies revealed renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.1 mg/dl, urea 92 mg/dl, sodium 126 mmol/l), liver dysfunction (GOT 125U/l, GPT 80 U/l), elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 285.7 mg/l, fibrinogen 743 mg/dl, procalcitonin 17.42 ng/ml), anaemia 9.4 g/dl and neutrophilia (9930/microL, 91.6%). Other parameters (glycaemia, bilirubin, amylase, coagulation and venous gases) were normal. Urinalysis showed haematuria and leucocyturia, with negative nitrites. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram showed no alterations of interest. An urgent abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing at least 4 space-occupying lesions (LOEs) in the liver with a hypoechogenic appearance (abdominal ultrasound: multiple hepatic abscesses), some of which were reinforced, with septations and echogenic content, the largest of which was 2 cm and located in segment IV. The radiological history of the patient was assessed and a thoracic CT scan performed 5 months earlier showed a normal liver. The radiological conclusion, taking into account the clinical context of the patient and the relative new appearance of the lesions, was that the first possibility was infectious aetiology (abscesses). In view of the patient's clinical situation and the findings of the complementary tests, it was decided to admit her, initiating antibiotic therapy and requesting a complete blood analysis, blood cultures, stool culture and an abdominal CT scan to complete the imaging study.

Differential diagnosis
Liver abscess is a localised collection in the liver parenchyma resulting from an infectious process caused by bacteria (most common), amoebae or fungi. The liver can be contaminated via haematogenous, biliary or direct contact routes, and knowing the aetiopathogenesis allows us to suspect the micro-organism responsible in most cases. Among the most frequent microorganisms to be taken into account when making the differential diagnosis are the following:
- Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. or Pseudomonas spp. which are implicated in up to 60% of cases.
- Anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Clostridium spp which are detected in 35-45% of cases.
- Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and group D streptococci: these are rare, but should be considered in immunocompromised patients.
- Mycobacteria, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may cause culture-negative abscesses. - Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Yersinia spp and Brucella spp, especially implicated in infections in immunocompromised patients.
- Fungi, especially Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp, Histoplasma spp, Cryptosporidium spp and Sporothrix spp, frequently occur in an immunocompromised patient or after a trip abroad in the case of histoplasmosis.
- Entamoeba histolytica should be considered in case of a history of travel to an endemic area, presence of dysentery and presence of multiple abscesses.

Clinical course
During admission, multiple liver abscesses were confirmed by abdominal CT scan, which showed countless LOEs in both lobes with low attenuation in all phases and no central enhancement in relation to the liquid content, with some of them showing minimal peripheral enhancement in the portal and later phases (CT abdomen w/c: multiple liver abscesses). All these findings were compatible with multiple liver abscesses caused by unusual pyogenic germs. Forty-eight hours after admission, the microbiology department reported growth of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in blood cultures taken in the emergency department. In view of this result, in which a germ compatible with the patient's condition was isolated, it was decided not to perform an image-guided puncture, which would have been the diagnostic procedure of choice in this case, given that it was not without risk. Antimicrobial treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin was decided, maintaining the treatment started with metronidazole on admission, although it is controversial to maintain metronidazole as an aerobic germ responsible for the symptoms has been isolated. The patient's evolution was slowly favourable, with haemodynamic stabilisation, fever control and progressive improvement in blood tests, although renal deterioration and oedema in the lower limbs persisted. Given the history of lupus disease, a complete study of autoimmunity and renal function was decided, ruling out a new outbreak of the disease. Hydration and adequate volemia were boosted until renal function was controlled, which returned to normal on discharge. Based on the antibiogram, it was decided to sequence oral treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the duration of which was guided by the clinical, analytical and radiological response. The patient was reviewed in the outpatient clinic one month after discharge from hospital, and a control abdominal ultrasound scan was performed, confirming a decrease in the size of the abscesses, which finally disappeared completely in a new control ultrasound scan two weeks later. Clinically, the patient did not present any further symptoms.

Final diagnosis
Bacteraemia and liver abscesses due to Listeria monocytogenes in an immunosuppressed patient.
