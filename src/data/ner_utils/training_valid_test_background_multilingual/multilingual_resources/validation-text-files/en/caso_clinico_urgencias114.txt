A 65-year-old patient with a history of type 2 DM and dyslipidaemia with febrile symptoms of one week's evolution treated with antipyretics due to viral symptoms. In view of the poor evolution, he went to the emergency department. On examination, the patient was bradypsychic and tachypneic, with blood pressure of 140/70 and temperature of 40o. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. The blood count showed no leukocytosis with neutrophilia and a haemoglobin of 10 g/dl, LDH (486), GOT (92), GPT (60), alkaline phosphatase (610), GGT (54), ESR (99) and CRP (18). All other parameters and tumour markers were unaltered. Chest and abdominal X-ray were normal. In search of a probable abdominal focus, an abdominal ultrasound was requested in which multiple echogenic images with descending ring artefact were observed in the left hepatic lobe, suggesting the presence of gas. In view of the suspicion of abscess, an abdominal CT scan was performed which confirmed the diagnosis and showed a large collection measuring 9x10 cm in the left hepatic lobe with multiple gas bubbles. Intravenous treatment was started with Tazocel and Metonidazole with drainage by eographic control for extraction of purulent material. Streptococcus viridans and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated in blood cultures. Given the radiological increase in the abscess, it was decided to perform a surgical intervention by means of laparotomy, locating a chicken bone in the duodenal frame that went through the pylorus.
