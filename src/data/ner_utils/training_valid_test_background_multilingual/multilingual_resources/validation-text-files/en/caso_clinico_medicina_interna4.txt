PERSONAL HISTORY AND CURRENT MEDICAL HISTORY
A 49-year-old male patient with no medical or surgical history of interest, except for chronic active ethylism. He is a farm worker. He came to the emergency department of our hospital referred from Motril for assessment by Psychiatry. Two weeks earlier he had suffered an accidental fall with cranioencephalic traumatism and an uncomplicated linear occipital fracture. Subsequently, he stopped drinking alcohol, and days later attempted self-harm and began to behave aggressively towards his relatives, agitation, insomnia and visual and auditory hallucinations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Normal findings. Good general condition, conscious, alert, disoriented in space and time. Strength and sensitivity preserved and symmetrical in both hemispheres. Bilateral symmetrical +++/+++ reflexes. Gait not evaluable. Normal cranial nerves. Dysmetria in upper limbs. No meningeal signs.  Desquamative dermal lesions on hands and face, symmetrical, non-specific. Rest of the examination with no alterations of interest.

INITIAL EVOLUTION
The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine after assessment by Psychiatry. Treatment was started with benzodiazepines, thiamine and pyridoxine. After several weeks of treatment, there was no improvement, and the neurological alterations persisted, including: confusion, disorientation, agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, marked extrapyramidal rigidity, unintelligible language and fluctuations in the level of consciousness. In addition, there are various complications, among which we highlight the following:
- Diarrhoea, without pathological products. Persistence despite antidiarrhoeal treatment and empirical antibiotic treatment. Some improvement with the start of parenteral nutrition.
- Fever, with no apparent source. Central venous catheter placed for parenteral nutrition was removed and S. epidermidis was isolated in both blood cultures and catheter culture. No antibiotic treatment was required.
- Dermal lesions, present since admission, self-limited.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
* Analytically, there was a slight elevation of CK and macrocytic anaemia with normal folic acid and vitamin B12. Analytical parameters characteristic of malnutrition.
* Cranial CT scan: left frontal hypodensity, related to infarction or old trauma. Mild cerebral cortical atrophy. Linear image suggestive of non-displaced left occipital fracture. MRI: Small hyperintense lesions in the white matter of non-specific appearance, although suggestive of vascular origin. Focal cortical atrophy, suggestive of probable old contusions Increased subarachnoid spaces and lateral ventricles suggestive of atrophy.
* CSF: protein 19.8mg/dl, glucose 54mg/dl, ADA 9U/L, leukocytes 1/mm3, red blood cells 1/mm3. Culture and staining negative* Stool culture, C.difficile toxin, hepatitis B and C serology, LUES, and CMV viral load: normal * Echocardiogram, ECG, chest X-ray with no significant alterations. Abdominal ultrasound: evidence of chronic liver disease.
* Colonoscopy: colitis with ulcers suggesting ischaemic process as a first possibility. Colon biopsy: regenerative glandular changes and acute focal inflammation (microabscesses) that could be secondary to a previous infectious process.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
We must consider the neurological alterations that may appear in an alcoholic patient. At first it was thought to be withdrawal syndrome with delirium tremens, but the absence of signs of autonomic hyperactivity and the lack of improvement despite treatment with benzodiazepines, tiapride and support measures, despite the passage of days, did not agree with this diagnosis. For the same reason, alcoholic hallucinosis was ruled out. Another possible diagnosis could have been a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but the typical clinical findings, such as eye and gait disturbances in the former, or marked disturbances of retrograde and anterograde memory in the latter, were not found. In addition, the pathognomonic Wernicke's images were absent in the cranial MRI. Other vitamin deficiencies could also explain the clinical picture, such as pellagra due to vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency.

FINAL EVOLUTION:
The lack of improvement despite the time of evolution with marked fluctuations in the neurological alterations, the null response to treatment, the appearance of diarrhoea and the absence of relevant data in the complementary tests, was what finally made it the clinic that led us to the diagnosis.
 
DIAGNOSIS
In our case, the diagnosis was delayed as the cutaneous manifestations were not very florid, but went almost unnoticed, and could be included in this section. It should be noted that the appearance of the classic triad is quite rare. There are currently no tests or laboratory data for diagnosis, even if there are supporting data, it is based solely on the clinical picture. This disease should be considered above all in malnourished patients: alcoholics (the most important factor in our environment), dietary transgressions, intestinal malabsorption, HIV... Treatment is based on the administration of niacinamide, 100 mg/6 hours initially and then 50 mg/8 hours with an early and very satisfactory response. Pellagra, although infrequent nowadays, still occurs in our environment.
Our patient responded very favourably and rapidly to niacinamide administration. He was reviewed several months later in the clinic having stopped drinking alcohol and being completely asymptomatic.
