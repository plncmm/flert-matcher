A 3-week-old baby boy arrived with nasal congestion, tachypnoea and reduced lactation of 2 days' duration. He was born at 36 weeks to a 21-year-old woman, a primiparous tercigesta, who had received prenatal treatment for streptococcus B carrier. He had previously received a 48-hour course of antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis due to fever (temperature 38.5 °C), but blood tests were negative and he was discharged.

On admission to the ED, the patient had a temperature of 36.1°C, pulse 166 bpm, blood pressure 89/63 mm Hg, respiratory rate 40 bpm and oxygen saturation 87% on room air. A chest X-ray showed bilateral linear opacities and consolidation in the right upper lobe. Oxygen and antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) were administered and the patient was transferred to a paediatric hospital.

On transfer, the patient developed hypotension, tachycardia, hypothermia and tachypnoea. Droplet and contact precautions were applied and the patient was transferred to a negative pressure room in the paediatric intensive care unit, where he was intubated and received a crystalloid solution at a dose of 60 ml per kg body weight, followed by vasopressors. Nasal swabs were obtained for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing and a respiratory viral panel. Chest X-ray after intubation showed bilateral infiltrates and partial collapse of the right upper lobe. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal anatomical and functional cardiac features. The white blood cell count was 4000 per cubic mm, with 55% lymphocytes; inflammatory marker values were high.

Mechanical ventilation was started with positive end-expiratory pressure of 7 cm of water, inspired oxygen fraction of 0.6 and mean airway pressure of 22 cm of water, for an arterial oxygen partial pressure of 49 mm Hg and an arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure of 80 mm Hg. Treatment was changed to vancomycin, cefepime and amplicillin and withdrawn 48 hours later when cultures were negative. Treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for suspected COVID-19.

Hypotension disappeared on day 2 after admission. A right-sided pneumothorax was successfully treated with chest drainage. The patient was extubated on day 5 and discharged from the paediatric ICU. Results of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 on admission were positive on day 7; the patient completed the 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 9, the patient was discharged without oxygen therapy. Of the patient's eight household contacts, one (a 49-year-old woman) was symptomatic; however, none of the contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
