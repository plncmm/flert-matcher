An 18-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypothyroidism and mild persistent asthma was brought to the emergency department by his mother because of altered consciousness. His mother also reported that he had a fever, nasal congestion and cough of seven days' duration. His current medication was 450 mg lithium twice daily, 100 mg clozapine daily and levothyroxine. On examination, he was drowsy but awake. He had no acute complaints, could answer simple questions and was oriented. His vital signs were: respiratory rate 18 r.p.m., temperature 38.5 oC, pulse 120 l.p.m., pressure 120/60 and SpO2 98% on room air. Pulmonary examination was normal.
Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 11.79 x 103/mm3 with 17% lymphocytes, high creatinine 1.81 mg/dl (reference 1 mg/dl) and lithium concentration 2.60 mmol/L. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a pulse rate of 107 bpm. A chest X-ray was normal. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested by RT-PCR was positive.
He was admitted to the paediatric ICU because of COVID-19 infection, acute kidney injury and lithium intoxication. An aggressive dose of i.v. saline was administered to treat the lithium intoxication and acute kidney injury. He did not undergo haemodialysis. His mental status improved. He received symptomatic treatment for COVID-19 infection. His condition improved and he was discharged without further complications on the 11th day of hospitalisation. During his hospital stay he never developed hypoxaemia. Lithium treatment was discontinued, with the intention to reintroduce it at a follow-up visit.
