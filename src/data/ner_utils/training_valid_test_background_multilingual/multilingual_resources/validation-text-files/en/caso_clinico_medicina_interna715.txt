A 61-year-old woman with morbid obesity, intrinsic asthma, idiopathic right phrenic paresis and hypoventilation-obesity syndrome, as well as Sj√∂gren's syndrome, hypertensive heart disease and latent tuberculosis infection, among others. For two years she had suffered progressive deterioration of her functional capacity due to an arterial embolism in the right lower limb, with compartment syndrome after the embolectomy, which left femoral mononeuritis with difficulty walking as a sequela.
He attended the emergency department of our centre with dyspnoea, fever of 38.2oC and dry cough of acute onset in the last 24 hours. Physical examination revealed wheezing and lengthening of expiratory time, so bronchodilators, corticotherapy and levofloxacin were started on suspicion of infectious asthma exacerbation. A few days later, meropenem, aztreonam and vancomycin were administered due to the isolation of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, and a thoracic CT scan was performed without relevant alterations.
When there was no improvement, corticosteroid doses were increased, nebulised colistin was added and antibiotics were rotated to linezolid and cotrimoxazole, although progressive pancytopenia with the appearance of oral aphthae made it necessary to return to the previous regimen, in an admission that had already lasted more than a month.
A new thoracic CT scan showed the de novo appearance of multiple bilateral nodular lesions. The CMV PCR of the oral ulcers was positive. In view of the suspicion of significant immunosuppression, a gamma globulin study was also requested, showing a deficit of IgG and IgM and a galactomannan that was positive at very high titres.
Treatment with ganciclovir, voriconazole and anidulafungin was started, but the patient progressed unfavourably to exitus a few days later. Clinical autopsy revealed invasive aspergillosis as the cause of death.
