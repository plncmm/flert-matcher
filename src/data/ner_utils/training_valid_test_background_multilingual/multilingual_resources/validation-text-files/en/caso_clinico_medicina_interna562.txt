A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our centre for hallucinations and behavioural alterations. Her medical history includes allergy to penicillin, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to the current admission, the patient was on home treatment with intravenous ertapenem, at a dose of 1g/24h, indicated 13 days earlier for acute cholecystitis and bacteraemia due to multidrug-resistant Escherichica coli and Streptococcus anginosus. He consulted for confusional symptoms that began on the 5th day after discharge from hospital and started treatment with ertapenem. Initial examination revealed a temperature of 38.5oC, poor general condition, inattention, presence of mannerisms, sensory aphasia and paraphasia with preserved comprehension. The rest of the vital signs and the examination by apparatus did not show any valuable findings. Prior to admission, she was an autonomous patient with preserved higher functions, with only two episodes of disorientation, self-limited, occurring in relation to the infection. On admission, home treatment with anticholinergics and benzodiazepines was withdrawn and an extensive aetiological study was completed, ruling out toxic-metabolic, infectious and vasculocerebral causes (including basic laboratory tests, thyroid study, ammonium, lumbar puncture, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal tomography). Considering ertapenem as a possible cause of the neurological symptoms, in the absence of signs of infection, it was decided to withdraw antibiotic treatment. The patient showed progressive clinical improvement until resolution of the neurological symptoms on the 5th day after antibiotic withdrawal.
