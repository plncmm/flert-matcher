Anamnesis
An 81-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 DM, ischaemic heart disease and intermittent claudication who came to the dermatology department for incessant itching of the left ankle and foot for 1 year. He reported having applied ointment with a combination of bacitracin, neomycin and polymyxin without improvement. She denies changes in her usual medication (bisoprolol, metformin, pioglitazone, pravastatin, acetylsalicylic acid and cilostazol) or worsening of her baseline condition. His main concern is the pruritus, which causes continuous scratching, with crusty lesions that do not heal, which is the reason for his consultation.

Physical examination
Erythema and desquamation are observed from the dorsum of the foot to the lower third of the leg with an erythematous geographic border. In addition, several subcentimetric papules with a central crust adhering to the dorsum of the foot were observed. Distal pulses were normal with mildly decreased capillary refill.

Complementary examinations
Suspicion of possible dermatophytosis led to a positive result for Trichophytum rubrum and a biopsy was performed which revealed a sample lacking lining epithelium, with a central depression and extrusion of collagen fibres intermingled with cellular detritus. The underlying dermis showed areas of basophilic collagen degeneration and interstitial inflammatory aggregates with a predominance of neutrophils, these findings being compatible with perforating collagenosis.

Diagnosis
Tinea ignota and acquired perforating collagenosis secondary to continuous scratching.

Treatment
After 8 weeks of treatment with betamethasone dipropionate-clotrimazole ointment twice daily, there is complete resolution of the Trichophyton rubrum ringworm. With the cessation of the triggering cause of the scratching, in this case the fungal infection, the perforating lesions begin to progressively subside.
