Male, 44 years old. History of ulcerative colitis treated with pentasa. Seen in the emergency department on 3 occasions until hospital admission. 1st visit: fever of 4 days evolution, migratory joint pain, generalised myalgias and a pruritic internal supramalleolar lesion which the patient attributed to a bite. Examination: BP 169/78, HR 78, Ta 36.4, oxygen saturation 98%. Complete normal physical examination. No adenopathies. On the left lower limb: 1 cm pustular lesion with reddened edges, neither painful nor suppurative with erythema in the perilesional area, with no other lesions. Complementary tests: leucocytes 11,890, rest normal (haemogram, blood-urine biochemistry and chest X-ray). Diagnosis: cellulitis. Initial treatment: amoxicillin-ac clavulanic acid. 2nd visit: On the 3rd day after starting treatment, she returned to the emergency department due to persistent fever, appearance of skin lesions on the trunk and proximal extremities with painful inguinal and submaxillary lymphadenopathies. Examination: BP 158/75, HR 82, Ta 38.5, oxygen saturation 99%. Physical examination with no changes except for the progression of the skin lesions. Complementary tests: normal. Serology and cultures were requested from the emergency department. The patient works regularly in the countryside, in contact with water from canals and marshes, so zoonosis is suspected. Dexketoprofen was added and the patient was discharged home. 3rd visit: 8 days after onset, progression of the skin lesions and persistent fever. Physical examination was normal with abscessed inguinal and submandibular lymphadenopathy with traces of suppuration and ulceration on the surface. Laboratory tests: ESR 120, 14,400 leukocytes; negative serology and microbiological cultures. Differential diagnosis in the ED Initially infectious pathology: folliculitis, furunculosis, ecthyma or complicated cellulitis; ulcers caused by leishmaniasis, mycobacteria or deep mycosis. Less common: late syphilis or herpetic infections, which may produce suppurative ulcers. Cutaneous neoplasms or vascular ulcers. Evolution: clinical progression and therapeutic failure: admission is decided. On the ward, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid was maintained, with fever disappearing and no progression of the skin lesions. New febrile peak during admission and extension of skin lesions, so intravenous corticosteroids were started and dermatology was consulted on suspicion of pyoderma gangrenosum. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of pyoderma and the systemic symptoms disappeared.
