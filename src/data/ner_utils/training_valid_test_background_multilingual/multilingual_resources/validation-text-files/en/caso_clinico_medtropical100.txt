This is a 38-year-old man from Senegal, who had been in Spain for only 20 days, with no medical history of interest, and who came to the clinic due to the appearance of asymptomatic skin lesions on the right wrist, of one and a half months' evolution (the symptoms began in Senegal), which had gradually grown and had ulcerated. He had undergone various treatments with topical and systemic antibiotics without any response.

Physical examination revealed two ulcerated nodules on the dorsum and volar aspect of the right wrist, 5 cm in the longest axis, with a necrotic and friable centre and raised and infiltrated edges. The rest of the physical examination was normal, including the absence of adenopathies.

The differential diagnosis was mainly bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial infections, malignant tumours and tropical ulcer. A 6 mm punch biopsy of the edges of the lesion was performed and culture for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria was negative.

The biopsy result showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial and deep dermis, accompanied by numerous oval bodies of about 6 microns, both inside and outside macrophages, corresponding to amastigotes (intracellular form adopted by Leishmania in the host, as opposed to the promastigote form adopted in the mosquito vector).

The microbiological diagnosis was cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. major, based on clinical-epidemiological criteria.

Since our patient's lesions were multiple, large and highly inflammatory, systemic treatment with glucantime (meglumine antimoniate) 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days intramuscularly was chosen. One month after treatment the lesions showed clear signs of regression, in the form of hypopigmented scars, somewhat depressed and somewhat unsightly.
