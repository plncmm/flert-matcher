A 53-year-old man from Wenzhou (Zhejiang, China) was admitted to the First Associated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical School on 1 February 2020 with fever, dizziness, cough and expectoration of 9 days' duration. On initial consultation his temperature was 38.6°C. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein concentration of 70.5 mg/L (normal range: 0.00 - 10.00 mg/L). Complete blood count showed elevated leukocytes (14.9 x 109/L [normal range 3.5-9.5 x 109/L]), neutrophils (14.2 x 109/L [1.8-6.3 x 109/L]) and monocytes (0.42 x 109/L [0.1-0.6 x 109/L]). The D-dimer value was 0.68 mg/L (0.00-0.5 mg/L) and the thrombocyte count was 163 x 109/L, while the lymphocyte count was low (0.25; normal range: 1.0-3.2 x 109/L). A chest CT scan showed multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidation and bilateral lung involvement. The patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on RT-PCR analysis of sputum samples. The patient developed complications, including septic shock, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and catheter-associated infections. The patient was treated with antibacterials, antivirals and corticosteroids, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During hospitalisation, peripheral ischaemia developed in the right fingers and toes, which progressed to gangrene. From 29 February, the fingertips of the right hand began to show slight cyanosis; on 7 March, the cyanosis continued to progress, with clear demarcation. From 10 March onwards, the patient started to show black gangrenous manifestations on the fingertips.
