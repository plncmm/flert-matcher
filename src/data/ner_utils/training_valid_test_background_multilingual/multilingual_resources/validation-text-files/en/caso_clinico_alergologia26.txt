A 3-month-old infant presented immediately after the second bottle of adapted milk with vomiting, generalised urticaria, palpebral and auricular angioedema, possible apnoea and no reaction except to painful stimuli. The symptoms subsided rapidly with intravenous treatment. Tryptase 31.3 cg/L (baseline 8.8mcg/L).

Results:
Initial allergological study: positive skin tests to cow's milk, alpha-lactoalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin; total IgE 2U/mL and milk-specific IgE 0.27KU/L, beta-lactoglobulin 0.39kU/L, casein and alpha-lactoalbumin negative.
At 16 months of age, after ingesting a small amount of biscuit (containing milk), he developed a wheal in the right corner of the mouth.
At 26 months of age, after eating a yoghurt at nursery, he presented with angioedema of the eyelids, lips and uvula, accompanied by vomiting.
In successive allergological studies there were persistent positive skin tests against cow's milk and alpha-lactoalbumin, mainly total IgE (29-47U/mL) and specific IgE to cow's milk (12.5kU/L-21.3kU/L) with very low figures (<2kU/L) for fractions (beta-lactoglobulin, casein and alpha-lactoalbumin).
At 3 years of age, he tolerated foods containing milk such as chocolates, bechamel or biscuits.

In view of the test results, specific IgE to boiled cow's milk (1.77kU/L) was requested and subsequently a microarray was performed (ImmunoCAP ISAC 112), which only showed sensitisation to serum albumin from mammalian milk and meat. A prick by prick test was performed against fresh meat, with positive results for raw lamb, veal and pork.

The patient has always tolerated well-done meats.
