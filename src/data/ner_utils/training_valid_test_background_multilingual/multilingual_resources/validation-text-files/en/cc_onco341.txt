She consulted the emergency department in October 2015 for low back pain of months of evolution, with pain throughout the spine, mainly in the upper lumbar area, dull, continuous, with mechanical characteristics (VAS 6), with peaks of exacerbation (VAS 10) in relation to movements and no improvement with rest or NSAIDs, interfering with her daily activity in the last few weeks. He also presents with dyspnoea on moderate exertion and pleuritic pain on the left side.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed an 8 cm mass, of about 6 months' evolution, ulcerated, at the level of the left breast CSD, with no signs of infection, no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy, nor in other lymph node chains. There was also pain on palpation of the spinous process at the level of D12, L1 and L2; the rest of the examination was unaltered.

Complementary tests
The following complementary tests were performed in the emergency department:
- Chest X-ray: spiculated nodule of approximately 1.5 cm in LII.
- X-ray of the spine: blastic lesions at L1 and L2.
- Laboratory tests: Hb 8.6: Hb 8.6; GPT 89; LDH 620; Alkaline phosphatase 160.

In view of these findings, the patient was admitted to hospital and an urgent MRI of the spine and breast MRI were requested.
The MRI of the spine showed an infiltrative lesion at a posterior level in the vertebral body D12 with extension to the pedicle, both transverse processes and spinous process with bony expansion. Greater involvement of the L1 vertebral body with signs of bony expansion and involvement of all the posterior elements. Conjunctival foramina stenosis being severe in D12-L1, moderate in L1-L2 and mild-moderate in D11-D12, and radicular involvement of D12 and L1. Involvement of the spinous process of L2 and two nodular foci in D11 suggestive of metastasis.
Breast MRI showed an 8x8x5 mass in the left breast CSE, with exophytic growth, poorly defined contours and signs of skin involvement.

BAG was performed which was positive for Nottingham Grade II Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, ER 100%, RP 90%, Her 2 +++, Ki 67 60%. Luminal B Her 2+.
In the extension study the CT scan also showed a right paratracheal adenopathic conglomerate of 3.5 cm and pulmonary nodules, the largest of 15 mm in the apical segment of LII and in LSI of 5 mm.
The GGO showed multiple lesions with lytic predominance in the chondro-sternal junction of the 3rd right costal arch, in posterior segments of the 5th right costal arch and fracture of the 2nd left costal arch.

Diagnosis
Finally, with the diagnosis of Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast cT4NxM1 luminal B Her 2 positive, she was discharged from hospital on 10/10/2015 and the case was evaluated in the Multidisciplinary Committee, proposing systemic treatment.

Treatment
After being assessed in medical oncology consultations, it was decided to start antialgic RT on the spine, due to poor analgesic control.
Subsequently, she started first-line chemotherapy treatment with Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab-Docetaxel, with no notable toxicity.
When the patient attended the consultation for the 2nd cycle, she continued with lumbar pain with functional limitation despite third-stage analgesia and even reported greater weakness in the lower limbs, although without loss of strength on examination.

Evolution
Given the suspicion of spinal cord compression, hospital admission was decided, high-dose steroid treatment was started and an MRI of the spine was performed which, compared with the previous one, showed spinal cord involvement at the level of the T12 vertebral body and the upper vertebral plateau of L1 in relation to kyphosis secondary to fracture/crushing, without demonstrating myelopathy.
Relative rest was indicated, with no neurological symptoms at the time of evaluation, and orthotic support options were assessed and, after consultation with the Rehabilitation Service, dorsolumbar orthosis was performed.

With good initial evolution, on 16/12/2915 a second cycle of QMT Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab- Docetaxel was prescribed with the addition of zolendronic acid. Forty-eight hours into the cycle she presented fever with no apparent focus (except for tumour lesion in the breast), for which she started empirical therapy with Augmentine (later the culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to amoxicillin). Aureus sensitive to amoxicillin).
Good initial evolution, for which she received 3rd cycle of QMT on 7/1/2016. However, he presented febrile peaks, so in the absence of a clear focus, a CT scan was requested to re-evaluate the tumour and study persistent febrile syndrome.
The CT scan showed a clear tumour response, but an abdominal lesion suggestive of abscess secondary to covert intestinal perforation at the level of the sigma was observed.
She underwent emergency surgery on 8/1/16 and Hartmann type resection with a torpid evolution (paralytic ileus requiring NGUS and febrile symptoms in the context of post-chemotherapy neutropenia and superinfection by E. Coli, Eneterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella producing BLEAs).
In the anatomopathological study of the abdominal surgery, peritoneal implants were reported that were not consistent with a known primary breast tumour. After extensive immunohistochemical study (cellular positivity for CK-AE1-AE3 , oestrogen receptors, WT1 and PAX8, negativity for GATA3, HER-2, GCDFP15 and progesterone) it was concluded that the most probable origin was papillary serous carcinoma of ovarian origin.
Retrospective review of the CT scan revealed a right adnexal mass of about 6 cm and multiple peritoneal implants.
The case was re-evaluated at the Clinical Session and with the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, chemotherapy treatment was modified with the intention of maintaining the response achieved in breast cancer with adequate coverage of the second ovarian neoplasm.
Chemotherapy with Carboplatin-Paclitaxel and maintenance of Her-2 blockade was therefore indicated and, after resolution of post-surgery complications and withdrawal of isolation, she was discharged.

Received on 11/2/2016, 1st cycle (at 80% dose), without notable toxicity, received the following cycles with 100% dose with PR by CT after 4 cycles, pending evaluation after 6 cycles.
She was referred to the Genetic Counselling consultation with molecular results 5382insC in BRCA1, confirming that the patient is therefore a carrier of this mutation, indicating follow-up for her and her descendants in this genetic counselling unit.
