HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A 56-year-old man, with no known allergies, with a history of arterial hypertension, moderate obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with sintrom and gout. He was a bus driver by profession. He came to the emergency department with a single episode of oppressive central chest pain that woke him up in the early hours of the morning, of approximately one hour's duration, non-radiating and without associated vegetative cortex, with no other concomitant symptoms (dyspnoea, palpitations, syncope, etc.). The chest pain subsided during her stay in the emergency department after starting intravenous solinitrin infusion and controlling her blood pressure.
On arrival, he was in good general condition. Blood pressure was 200/121 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiopulmonary auscultation and the rest of the physical examination were normal. A patient with an episode of chest pain at rest and troponin elevation in the context of very high blood pressure was admitted to Cardiology with the initial diagnosis of hypertensive emergency.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG on admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Narrow QRS. Q in III and VF with ST elevation of less than 1mm. V3-V6 and negative T in aVL. Poor progression of R in precordial leads. No changes in serial ECG, all without pain. Laboratory tests in the emergency department: haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation normal. Myocardial necrosis markers slightly elevated (maximum US TnT 16 ng/ml being the limit 14, without typical curve of acute coronary syndrome). Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly. Aortic elongation. Hilar thickening.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated left ventricle with moderate concentric hypertrophy (14-14 mm), without alterations of segmental contractility. Dilatation of the ascending aorta. Stress cardiac MRI with dipyridamole: hypertensive heart disease with normal LVEF. Absence of inducible ischaemia or myocardial necrosis. Image of slight thickening of the thoracic aorta at the ascending and descending levels compatible with intramural haematoma.
Angio-CT scan: intramural haematoma affecting the aortic arch and extending to the descending thoracic aorta without reaching the abdominal aorta. No images of penetrating ulcer or signs of dissection were identified. No aneurysmal dilatations were observed. The rest of the aorta had no significant findings. Central laboratory: urea 38 mg/dl, creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, uric acid 10.6 mg/dl. uric acid 10.6 mg/dl, sodium 139 mmol/l, potassium 4.4 mmol/l, chlorine 102 mmol/l, cholesterol 273 mg/dl, triglycerides 341 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 44 mg/dl, direct LDL cholesterol 190 mg/dl, leukocytes 9100 /mm3, haemoglobin 13.6 g/dl, OHT 41%, platelets 250000/mm3, INR 1.08, HbA1c 7%, TSH 0.7 Î¼U/ml.

EVOLUTION
During his stay in the cardiology ward, the patient remained clinically stable and asymptomatic, without new episodes of chest pain, with good control of blood pressure under treatment with beta-blockers, oral nitrates and ACE inhibitors. After performing a transthoracic echocardiogram on the first day of hospital admission, and finding dilatation of the ascending aorta, a stress MRI with dipyridamole was requested to evaluate the aorta and rule out both acute aortic syndrome and ischaemic heart disease. Following the diagnosis of intramural haematoma with the imaging tests, successive angio-CT scans were performed to assess the evolution, given that the patient remained clinically stable. Given the absence of haematoma growth on imaging tests and as the ascending aorta was not compromised, expectant management was decided, with discharge from hospital and preferential follow-up in the Cardiovascular Surgery outpatient department. Twenty-five days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with a new episode of sudden and intense pain in the lumbar region accompanied by paraesthesia in the right lower limb. Examination revealed an absence of femoral pulses bilaterally. An emergency angio-CT scan was performed, revealing a type A dissection with extension from the ascending aorta to both iliac arteries, as well as thrombosis of the false lumen in the ascending aorta, highlighting the significant increase in the diameter of the ascending aorta with respect to the previous study. In view of these findings, urgent surgery was decided. During the surgical procedure, it was not possible to detect the entrance door at the level of the ascending aorta or the arch, so a diagnosis of a type B dissection with retrograde progression was finally made, and the ascending aorta was replaced with a 32 mm Dacron graft. Subsequently, the patient had a torpid evolution during his stay in the ICU, requiring vasoactive drugs and daily haemofiltration in the immediate postoperative period. After clinical stabilisation, the patient was extubated and discharged from the intensive care unit. During his stay in the ward, the patient evolved adequately without further complications and was discharged and referred to outpatients for follow-up with an intensive rehabilitation programme. Currently, 3 months after admission for hypertensive emergency, the patient is clinically stable.


DIAGNOSIS
The cardiac MRI, which was negative for ischaemia, showed an image compatible with intramural haematoma in the thoracic aorta, without affecting the ascending aorta, so CT angiography was requested and confirmed the findings previously described.
