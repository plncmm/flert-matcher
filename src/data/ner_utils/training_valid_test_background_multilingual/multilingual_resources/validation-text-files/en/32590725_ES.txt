A 27-year-old woman, G2P1, 33 weeks gestation with short intergestational period, was admitted with COVID-19 to a local 166-bed hospital. She was admitted to the labour and delivery ward for continuous fetal monitoring; the internal medicine service was consulted for joint care. The mother's condition progressively worsened and she was transferred to the ICU, where she was intubated. The patient presented with worsening anaemia and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells and prophylactic treatment with low-dose heparin was started. On day 5 of hospitalisation, ventilation requirements had to be increased. The ICU team considered placing the patient in prone position or transferring her to another centre for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, complicated by her pregnancy. It was decided to proceed with delivery to improve the mother's oxygenation. The empty room adjacent to the patient in the ICU was used to store material and equipment for a vaginal delivery and a caesarean delivery. Thus, in case of maternal or foetal signs of urgent delivery, the delivery could be performed in the same ICU. The patient was receiving prophylactic anticoagulants with a low dose of subcutaneous heparin, which was withdrawn during induction of labour. It was considered that heparin would have a minimal effect on bleeding, which could be reversed if necessary. No corticosteroids were administered for fetal lung maturity. With the viral pneumonia, the medical team considered that the risks to the mother outweighed the benefits to the fetus at 33 5/7 weeks gestation. The evidence at that time for this case indicated that steroids are not recommended for a gestational age above 32 weeks. Although the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, she was considered an acceptable candidate for induction of labour. The decision was made based on the patient's history of uncomplicated term vaginal delivery 11 months earlier and the fact that she was having contractions and had dilated to 0-3 cm. On the morning of induction, an ultrasound confirmed a cephalic vertex presentation and 25 micrograms of misoprostol was administered intravaginally. Five hours later, dinoprostone was administered because the patient had developed tachysysystole with misoprostol without cervical changes. The ability to withdraw dinoprostone in case of recurrent tachysysystole or fetal intolerance to labour was considered an advantage. During the latent phase of labour, fetal tachycardia occurred, with variable decelerations over 11 minutes. Fetal heart tones returned to normal with accelerations with repositioning.

During labour, the patient was deeply sedated with propofol, midazolam and fentanyl and did not require additional sedation. Seven hours after dinoprostone administration, an amniotomy was performed when the patient was 5 cm dilated and the effacement was 80%. An internal pressure catheter was placed. No fetal scalp electrode was necessary because the fetus could be easily monitored. The patient progressed without the need for oxytocin; 3.5 hours later she was 9 cm dilated, 90% effaced and station 0, with variable fetal decelerations. The foetus presented another variable, with a minimum of 60 l.p.m. and return to baseline after 90 seconds. With the next contraction, the variables persisted, with a minimum of 70 bpm. A cervical scan revealed that the cervix was fully dilated and effaced, with the occiput between station +1 and +2. The fetal pulse showed repetitive variable decelerations. The patient was placed in frog leg position. A wedge pillow was available in the delivery room, but it was considered that there was sufficient space for manoeuvres due to the maternal position. Prior to forceps placement, the patient received a bolus of fentanyl. The foetus was anterior occiput and a 12-inch Simpson's forceps could be easily applied. The baby was delivered easily with a single thrust and with the perineum intact. The neonatology and intensive care staff attending the delivery indicated that the patient responded to the forceps delivery by raising her hand and briefly opening her eyes. The delivery showed a tight turn of the umbilical cord. The newborn was transferred to the waiting neonatal team. Apgar scores were 3 at 1 minute, 5 at 5 minutes and 5 at 10 and 15 minutes; the newborn's weight was 2430 grams. Only one venous cord blood gas was obtained, with a pH of 7.39. The total time between induction and delivery was 14.5 hours. The patient's husband was not allowed to attend the delivery in the ICU because of hospital restrictions due to COVID-19.

The newborn was intubated after birth for about 24 hours. No surfactant administration was needed. Neonatal testing for coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed.
(SARS-CoV-2) were negative at 24 and 48 hours of life. The results of a chest radiograph were normal. Amniotic fluid, placental surface and breast milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patient's husband was able to visit the NICU after both he and the newborn were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Our institution required the mother to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 in successive tests 24 hours apart before she could be in contact with the newborn in the NICU. This occurred 22 days after her initial positive test. The newborn was discharged at 36 2/7 weeks postmenstrual age. It should be noted that the patient's assisted breathing was stable during dilatation and delivery, with values between 45% and 50% FIO2. The condition improved within one hour after delivery, with an FIO2 of 35%. The patient spent 4 more days on assisted ventilation, for a total of 9 days on mechanical ventilation. She was discharged on hospital day 16 with enoxaparin prophylaxis for 4 weeks.
