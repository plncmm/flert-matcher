This is a 65-year-old white male patient on continuous peritoneal dialysis with cycler (CCPD) for 5 years, who came to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea of 8 hours' duration, with cloudy peritoneal fluid and no fever. During the 5 years that the patient was on PD, he had presented 5 previous episodes of peritonitis, 3 with negative culture, 1 due to Enterobacter cloacae and the last one, 2 months before the current episode, due to Streptococcus anginosus, all of them with evolution to cure and 1 year before an infection of the exit orifice of the peritoneal catheter due to Staphylococcus capitis.

On arrival the patient was normotensive, afebrile and the peritoneal catheter exit site showed signs of infection. The peritoneal fluid was cloudy and the blood count showed 6,080 leukocytes/mm3 (N 80%, L 20%). Gram stain was negative for germs. Blood analysis revealed 10,600 leukocytes/mm3 (N 87.9%, L 6.4%, M 4.5%) and CRP 40.3mg/l. After extracting samples for peritoneal fluid culture, treatment was started with vancomycin and intraperitoneal gentamicin according to the unit's protocol, but due to persistent cloudy fluid and intense abdominal pain, the peritoneal catheter was removed and the patient started haemodialysis through a functioning AVF. Subsequently, the results of the peritoneal fluid cultures were received, showing gram-negative cocci, later identified as Pasteurella canis, resistant to vancomycin. The patient was questioned about his pets, stating that he had 2 dogs living outside the house, with no previous bites or scratches. The culture of the exit wound shows growth of gram-positive bacilli sensitive to vancomycin.
