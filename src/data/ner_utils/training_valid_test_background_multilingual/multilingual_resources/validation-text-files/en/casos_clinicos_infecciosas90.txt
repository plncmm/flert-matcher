We present the case of a 37-year-old male worker in a strawberry cooperative alongside immigrants, with no known drug allergies or toxic habits. His medical history included episodes of intermittent hemicranial headache of more than ten years' duration. She did not report any risky sexual relations. She consulted the emergency department for severe holocranial headache and gait instability of four days' duration.
The anamnesis included a fever and vomiting of non-food content the previous night (up to three times), intermittent paraesthesia in both hands for three days, and catarrhal symptoms with cough and whitish expectoration for a week.

On physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented. He was cooperative, although bradypsychic. Glasgow 15/15. Eupneic and without increased respiratory work. Blood pressure was 120/63 mmHg, heart rate 52 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. He was afebrile. On cardiopulmonary auscultation the heart sounds were rhythmic and without audible murmurs; the vesicular murmur was preserved. The abdomen was soft and depressible, no masses or megaliths were palpable. No skin lesions were observed.

The neurological examination revealed pain on passive mobilisation of the neck, without stiffness, paresis of the right sixth nerve and ataxia on walking with a fall to the right. The ED analysis showed: haemoglobin 14.4 g/dL; leukocytes 11,240/mm3 with 84% segmented; CRP 44.5 mg/L; urine sediment showed no evidence of infection and antigenuria for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella sp were negative. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without alterations of the QRS or repolarisation. Chest X-ray was normal and non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the skull showed no pathological findings. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) extraction at a pressure of 28 cm H2O with a cloudy appearance. CSF analysis revealed 1649 leukocytes; 88% polymorphonuclear; 12% monocytes; 35 mg/dL glucose (blood glucose 130mg/dL); 189.3 mg/dL protein; 14.7 U/L adenosine deaminase (ADA); negative xanthochromia. Gram stain was negative. Bacterial antigens of N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were requested in CSF and samples were sent for culture. Given the clinical suspicion and CSF biochemistry compatible with bacterial meningitis, samples were taken for blood culture and empirical antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone 2 g/12h intravenous (i.v.) and vancomycin 1 g/12h i.v. Given the presence of elevated CSF pressure and the atypical symptoms of ataxia and paresis of the VI pair, ampicillin 2 g/4h i.v. was added to the treatment to cover Listeria monocytogenes as a possible causative organism. We requested emergency HIV serology, which was negative; serology for syphilis, tuberculin test (PPD or Mantoux) and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Differential diagnosis
Given the patient's clinical presentation of acute meningoencephalitis and the negative Gram stain and bacterial antigens in CSF, we include in the differential diagnosis those processes that may cause meningoencephalic involvement and CSF with neutrophilic pleocytosis, glucose consumption and hyperproteinorrachia.
- Acute bacterial meningitis: The most frequent cause in adults of all ages is Streptococcus pneumoniae. In young adults, Neisseria meningitidis is the next most frequent cause. In our patient, the cloudy appearance of the CSF, the presence of more than 1,000 leukocytes with a neutrophil percentage of 83%, and the glucose intake suggest a high suspicion of bacterial meningitis. However, although neck pain and severe headache are common manifestations, it is rare for acute bacterial meningitis to present with normal temperature. Furthermore, the negativity of the Gram stain and bacterial antigens of N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the patient's CSF should lead us to doubt these three microorganisms as possibly responsible for the patient's symptoms. The involvement of the VI pair and the clinical manifestations of ataxia led us to think of meningitis due to Listeria monocytogenes, as it is common for it to present with focal neurological manifestations and rhomboencephalic involvement1. 1 However, it usually affects neonates, the elderly or immunocompromised patients. In our case, the patient was a young, healthy male with no factors that could be compromising his immune system, including negative HIV serology. Moreover, no gram-positive bacilli were identified in CSF.
- Syphilitic meningitis: After primary infection, Treponema padillum can spread to the central nervous system and cause meningitis with manifestations similar to acute bacterial meningitis, often involving the optic, auditory and facial nerves. It usually occurs in secondary syphilis and is accompanied by other peripheral manifestations such as skin rash. Lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein concentration may be found in the CSF. Glucose levels are usually decreased. Our patient did not report risky sexual relations or a history of previous syphilis. He also had no skin lesions suggestive of secondary syphilis. CSF analysis showed elevated protein levels and glucose intake, features that are shared with syphilitic meningitis. However, what stood out in the CSF analysis was the predominance of neutrophils which would argue against this diagnosis. CSF treponemal tests are in most cases positive in syphilitic meningitis, although, given the low clinical suspicion, they were not requested at first. We did request serology for Treponema padillum in plasma in order to rule out this entity.
- Viral encephalitis and viral meningitis: Behavioural alterations, motor and sensory deficits, as well as personality changes are frequent alterations of encephalitis. However, it is common to find patients with parenchymal and meningeal involvement. In both processes the CSF characteristics are similar; normal glucose levels; elevated protein concentration; elevated leukocytes with a predominance of neutrophils in early stages, and lymphocytes in later stages. Glucose levels are usually normal. The most common cause of viral meningitis is enteroviruses. Other viruses responsible include HIV, West Nile virus (WNV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), mumps virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). A common cause of sporadic encephalitis is herpes simplex virus type 1. Although the clinical picture of meningoencephalic involvement in our patient could fit the diagnosis of viral meningoencephalitis, the characteristics of the CSF with neutrophilic pleocytosis and glucose consumption would argue against this diagnosis.
- Tuberculous meningitis: Clinical manifestations vary in the course of the disease; headache and personality changes are common in early stages, while positive meningeal signs and motor or sensory deficits usually appear later. In later stages, multiple nerves may be affected and result in severe neurological deficits, including coma. It usually affects adults with some involvement of the immune system, through reactivation of chronic forms and haematogenous spread. CSF usually shows mononuclear pleocytosis, although sometimes the cellular reaction is atypical in early stages with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells. Protein levels are usually elevated and glucose levels are decreased. Measurement of ADA in CSF is useful in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, although high concentrations may be found in some bacterial infections2. In our case, the patient was young, healthy and HIV-negative, although the epidemiological context (working alongside immigrants) could have favoured infection. The atypical clinical features of the patient, together with the characteristics of the CSF with glucose consumption, relatively high levels of ADA and increased protein, could point to this entity. Although neutrophilic CSF pleocytosis is not common in tuberculous meningitis, this diagnosis cannot be ruled out.
- Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis: It usually affects immunocompromised patients due to HIV infection, glucocorticoid treatment or transplant recipients, among others. In most cases it manifests as subacute meningoencephalitis, often without fever. CSF outflow pressure is usually elevated and CSF analysis usually shows increased leukocytes with a predominance of monocytes, glucose consumption and elevated protein. It is now possible to detect cryptococcal antigen in CSF and serum early,3 although definitive diagnosis is made by CSF culture. In our patient, HIV serology was negative, and in principle he did not present any factor that could be compromising his immune system. However, there are cases in the literature of patients with Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis without any apparent risk factor. The atypical clinical presentation of meningoencephalic involvement without fever, increased CSF outflow pressure, and CSF analysis with elevated glucose and protein levels led us to include this entity in the differential diagnosis.

Evolution
After three days of empirical treatment, the patient experienced no improvement. He presented repeated episodes of agitation and confusion, and a new clinical manifestation was diplopia. Given the lack of response to treatment and the negativity of CSF bacterial antigens as well as bacterial cultures (blood and CSF cultures) at 72 hours, it was decided to withdraw vancomycin from treatment. The PPD was negative at 48 hours and the MRI of the skull showed a small focus of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity, with a dubious focal area of associated enhancement, which was reported as a focus compatible with encephalitis. In view of these findings, and pending CSF cultures, we added acyclovir to the treatment. The lues serology was negative.
On the third day of admission, Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in CSF culture and treatment was started with liposomal amphotericin B 350 mg/24h i.v. and flucytosine 2 g/6h i.v. Antibacterial and antiviral treatment was discontinued. At this point, and in search of any factor that might be compromising our patient's immune system, we requested a new HIV serology, HIV viral load and lymphocyte subpopulation study. The patient evolved favourably with antifungal treatment. However, it was necessary to perform two evacuating LPs, in the first and second week of admission, to maintain CSF outflow pressure below 20 cm H2O. The control MRI performed in the second week of admission showed a focus of hyperintensity in the left thalamus compatible with cryptococcoma. In view of this new finding, and despite the fact that the CSF Cryptococcus antigen and the control CSF culture at 15 days were negative, it was decided to prolong the induction phase with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine for two weeks longer than usual, up to a total of 4 weeks. As an adverse effect of liposomal amphotericin B, the patient developed asymptomatic hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia which were corrected with good control. While HIV serology was again negative and HIV viral load undetectable, the CD4 lymphocyte count was 162 x/microL with a percentage of 19% of total lymphocytes. These data led us to consider idiopathic CD4+ lymphocyte deficiency (ICL) as the entity responsible for our patient's lymphopenia. After completing the induction phase of treatment (4 weeks) and having observed a reduction in the size of the cryptococcomas in the control MRI, the patient was discharged with home treatment to continue the consolidation phase with fluconazole 800 mg/24h orally for 10 weeks, and the maintenance phase with fluconazole at 200 mg/24h for 6 months. In view of the CD4+ lymphocyte deficit, and having ensured good control of potassium levels, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was started with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 160/800 mg every other day.
Primary immunodeficiency testing was performed on an outpatient basis. Two months after discharge, the CD4+ lymphocyte count was still below 300 leukocytes per cubic centimetre with a percentage of less than 20% of the total lymphocytes. In the study of lymphocyte subpopulations, decreased levels of B cells were also observed. Complement and immunoglobulin levels and their subclasses were normal.

Definitive diagnosis
Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis complicated by cryptococcoma located in the left thalamus. Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocyte deficiency as underlying cause of immunosuppression.
