A 34-year-old man from Argentina with no known drug allergies, who only refers to occasional episodes of rhinoconjunctivitis triggered by environmental allergens. He is not currently taking any medication. He comes for consultation (April 2004) for advice on an unorganised tourist trip to South Asia, lasting 180 days. He will travel in June and will stay in hotels, guesthouses and private homes. He will visit both urban and rural areas of Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia, including a stay in the jungle for two or three weeks. He intends to spend the last two weeks in Australia to visit a friend. His epidemiological history includes trips to Morocco, Egypt, India and Nepal. He is currently vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria, typhoid fever, hepatitis A+B, polio and rabies.
Due to the geographical area that this traveller will be travelling through, as well as the type of trip: unorganised, long duration and with prolonged stays in rural areas, we consider it very important, in addition to the advice given in the consultation - hygiene of water and food, barrier measures to avoid insect bites, risk of sexually transmitted diseases, etc. - to vaccinate against Japanese encephalitis.
