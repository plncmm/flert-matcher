A 46-year-old woman was referred with clinical data of febrile fever, pain in the right renal fossa (FRD) and positive fist percussion. Suspicion of complicated renal colic. Complementary tests: urine leucocyturia with positive nitrites and haematuria. In blood, slight leukocytosis with neutrophilia and CRP of 168 mg/L. An urgent abdominal ultrasound was performed and we completed the study with MDCT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast. The findings were compatible with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). As an incidental finding, morphological alterations were observed in relation to the aortomesenteric clamp (having to clinically assess the possibility of nutcracker syndrome, whether or not associated with Wilkie syndrome).
