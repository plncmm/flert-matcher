A 38 year old bisexual patient, diagnosed with HIV infection in 1992, currently in stage C3 (CD 4 291 cells/μl, viral load 4,400 copies/ml) came to the emergency department with a red left eye (OI) and a decrease in visual acuity over three days. The condition was accompanied by a rash affecting the palms and soles and general malaise of one month's duration.

The ophthalmological examination showed hand movement visual acuity in the left eye, with moderate conjunctival injection, intense cellularity and abundant fibrin in the anterior chamber and posterior synechiae. The fundus was unexplorable. The following day the fundus could be explored after intensive therapy with corticosteroids and topical mydriatics, showing intense vitritis and inferior vitreous condensation. Skin examination revealed an erythematous-violaceous maculo-papular rash with small oval plaque-like lesions that also affected the palms and soles. Serology was performed and the results were positive with positive RPR 1/32, IgG and TPHA. Lumbar puncture was performed to study the cerebrospinal fluid, obtaining a cell count of 2 leukocytes/μl and some haemocytes, total protein 295 mg/dl, glucose 65 mg/dl (simultaneous glycaemia 104 mg/dl), VDRL and syphilis IgG negative, anti-HIV positive and increased intrathecal production of immunoglobulins with IgM 2.1, IgG 47, IgG/albumin 0.32.

Topical treatment was started with corticosteroids and mydriatics, and systemic treatment with penicillin G sodium at a dose of 4 million units every 4 hours for 15 days. The evolution was satisfactory with recovery of visual acuity to 0.9, resolution of inflammation and vitritis and disappearance of the rash.
