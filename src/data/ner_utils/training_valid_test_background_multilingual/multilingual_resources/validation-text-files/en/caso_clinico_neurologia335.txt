Anamnesis
A 46-year-old woman, of high intellectual level, with no pathological history, was brought to the Emergency Department for the first time presenting with two seizures. According to her husband, the seizures began with disconnection, facial gestures, subsequent generalised rigidity and clonic movements of the four limbs and a post-critical period of about 15 minutes in each episode. The previous four days she had presented a self-limited influenza episode without fever, with asthenia and increased daytime somnolence but no behavioural changes. On arrival at the emergency department, he presented a coma crisis, this time with decreased level of consciousness and hypotension, which required orotracheal intubation and inotropic support. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where bitemporal status epilepticus was confirmed in the electroencephalographic recording. Phenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam, midazolam, pentothal and propofol were administered, without achieving electrical control of the seizures during 8 days of barbiturate coma. Empirical antibiotic and antiviral treatment was started after a lumbar puncture. Intravenous corticosteroid and immunoglobulins were administered without response. After the addition of lacosamide to the antiepileptic treatment on day 8, the electrical status was controlled and the patient was extubated, showing no seizures. She was admitted to the Neurology ward for further examination.

Physical examination
The patient was alert, partially oriented in person (she only remembered her name), disoriented in time and space. No aphasia. Marked anxiety and emotional lability. Significant impairment of anterograde memory. Severe impairment of explicit retrograde memory (both semantic and episodic): unable to remember names, dates, places, faces, etc., related to her own life or historical events. Moderate impairment of implicit retrograde memory: unable to remember gait patterns and coordinated movements such as combing hair, dressing or brushing teeth without evidence of dysmetria. Immediate and fixation memory preserved. Unaltered judgement and reasoning. The rest of the neurological examination was unaltered.

Complementary tests
- Serial video-electroencephalograms: during the first 8 days there was evidence of unstructured and slowed background activity, with frequent discharges originating in the bilateral temporo-frontal region and cortical myoclonias with their corresponding electroclinical correlation. On the eighth day of admission, the same diffuse cerebral involvement was recorded, with epileptiform anomalies but without discharges. On day 10, pseudoperiodic complexes began to appear in the temporal regions, which progressively disappeared in the control electroencephalograms.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): on the third day of status epilepticus showed hyperintensity in FLAIR and diffusion and hypointensity in ADC map in both hippocampuses without gadolinium enhancement. Shows hyperintensity in diffusion. Diffusion restriction in the bilateral hippocampus on day 3 of limbic status. A control at one month showed a decrease in the size of the hippocampi with respect to the initial MRI, with persistence of hyperintensity in FLAIR, hyperintensity in bilateral hippocampal FLAIR similar to that observed in the hippocampi, disappearance of diffusion restriction and slight development of periventricular parenchymal retraction. The image shows the size of the hippocampi on the third day of the status shows the reduction of the size of the hippocampi 3 months after the acute process. Control MRI after one year showed only hippocampal atrophy.
- Cerebrospinal fluid study: glucose 99 mg/dl, protein 43 mg/dl, leukocytes 6 cells/mm3. Bacterial, fungal and viral cultures were negative. ADA negative. PCR negative for: enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes virus 6, West Nile virus, Toscana virus, varicella zoster virus, JC virus, BK virus and Borrelia.
- Special laboratory tests: lactate 1.4 IU/l, negative tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 125 antigen, CA 15-3 antigen, beta-2-microglobulin protein). Antinuclear antibodies positive 1/160 non-specific. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies and ANCA negative. Negative serum onconeuronal antibodies including anti-Hu, anti-NMDa, anti-NMDAR, anti-GABAR, anti-AMPAR, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2 and anti-potassium channel VGKC.
- Serologies: all negative (HIV 1/2, syphilis, Brucella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, hepatitis A, B and C virus).
- Cultures: negative blood cultures, urine cultures, tracheal and rectal exudate cultures.
- CT body scan: no pathological findings.

Diagnosis
- Limbic encephalitis secondary to refractory limbic status.
- Secondary Korsakoff's syndrome.

Treatment
Levetiracetam 1,500 mg/12 h, lacosamide 200 mg/12 h and rehabilitation treatment in a brain damage centre focused on the recovery of memory skills.

Evolution
One year later, the patient presented simple sporadic partial seizures of temporal semiology. Mild temporal-spatial disorientation persists, the memory deficit persists, although with slight improvement in explicit retrograde memory (she sometimes remembers an event but does not place it in the correct time; she remembers and recognises her close relatives), complete recovery of implicit retrograde memory which facilitates daily tasks. Anterograde memory deficit persists with inability to acquire new knowledge.
