On 28 February, a 50-year-old man with IgA nephropathy, recipient in 2016 of a third kidney from a deceased donor, with serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60 mL/min attended the emergency department; he reported fever (38.2 oC) and vomiting of 24 hours' evolution. He reported no other symptoms and had no history of foreign travel or exposure to COVID-19 infected or suspected patients.
His medical history indicated a scheduled splenectomy in 2003, caused by thrombocytopenia, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PLD) associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), treated with rituximab and withdrawal of immunosuppression, which led to complete remission of the PLD, but resulted in rejection and failure of the second renal graft. After remission of PVL and a negative EBV viral load, she received a third kidney transplant with induction of immunosuppression (IS) with thymoglobulin, trachrolimus, everolimus and steroids, and maintenance IS treatment with tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone 5 mg daily. He was also being treated for hypertension with losartan 50 mg twice daily.
On initial evaluation in the emergency department, the patient showed signs of mild dehydration. Physical examination was otherwise irrelevant, including breath sounds on auscultation. Clinical tests for acute phase proteins were normal, including C-reactive protein < 0.50 mg/dL (normal value < 1.0 mg/dL) and leukocyte count of 8.58 x 109/L, but mild renal dysfunction (Cr 1.6 mg/dL, eGFR 50 mL/min). He was discharged with a provisional diagnosis of non-severe viral gastroenteritis and was prescribed oral hydration and acetaminophen on demand.
Five days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with persistent fever but this time with a productive cough. He no longer had gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination showed a temperature of 37.4°C, blood pressure 180/100 mmHg, pulse 66 bpm, respiratory rate 16 bpm and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He had signs of mucosal dehydration and crackles in the lower right lung, as well as signs of conjunctivitis in the left eye. Cardiac examination showed no murmurs, friction rubs or gallops. The abdomen was soft, painless and depressible and the neurological examination was normal.
The peripheral blood leucocyte count was 10.15 x 109/L (total lymphocyte count 1.8 x 109 U/L), with a thrombocyte count of 126 x 109/L, a C-reactive protein of 13.2 mg/dL and a procalcitonin value of 0-18 ng/mL (normal value < 0.50 ng/mL). Mild persistent renal dysfunction (Cr 1.6 mg/dL) and hyponatraemia (129 mEq/L) were also observed. Liver transaminases and coagulation were within normal reference values. Anteroposterior radiograph showed consolidation in the middle lobe. Accordingly, a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was assumed and an interim treatment of ceftriaxone (1 g per day) and azithromycin (500 mg per day) was started. A nasopharyngeal swab and a rapid nucleic acid amplification test for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus were performed and were negative.
Subsequently, although the patient had no history of travel or known contacts with infected or infectious persons, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for COVID-19 testing, following an update of the local authority screening protocol for pneumonias of undetermined origin. Real-time RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 of both smears was positive (as of this point in time considered as reference day: D0).
The local protocol for COVID-19 was activated, the patient was hospitalised in isolation and on day D+1 treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 twice daily orally was started. Because of the interaction of ritonavir with calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus was withdrawn, as was everomylus because of the reported risk of mTOR inhibitor-induced pneumonitis. An interim course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftaroline and meronepem) was initiated and maintained, despite negative culture results for viral, bacterial or fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, pneumocystosis or mycobacteria. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed orally (400 mg twice daily for 24 hours; then 200 mg twice daily).

After 10 days from initial symptoms and 72 h of symptomatic and antiviral treatment, the patient showed worsening respiratory symptoms, with hypoxia, despite high-flow nasal oxygen support, and progression to bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest CT. At this point he was started on interferon ß. The patient was intubated (D+6), with assisted ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressure (12 cmH2O). Serum creatinine was increased to 2.1 mg/dL (eGFR 30 ml/min), with tacrolimus, maintained 10 days after withdrawal at 5.1 ng/mL. As of today (D+12), the patient is still on assisted ventilation in the ICU, haemodynamically stable and continues with treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (oral solution, pending change to remdesivir when available in the hospital), interferon ß (250 mcg every 48 h, subcutaneous) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily orally). Serum creatinine values of 3.0 mg/dL, leukocytes 14.5 x 109 U/L, lymphocytes 0.9 x 109 U/L, haemoglobin 9.3 g/DL, thrombocytes 410 x 109 U/L, D-dimer 8900 ng/mL (normal value < 500) and procalcitonin 0.54 ng/mL, without worsening respiratory failure.
