A 65-year-old woman with hypertension, autoimmune hypothyroidism and known exposure to COVID-19 presented to the emergency department with fatigue, fever, dry cough and abdominal discomfort, with a course of 4 days. On admission he was afebrile, with a respiratory rate of 28 r.p.m. and an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air; bilateral decreased breath sounds and bibasal rales were observed. Abdominal examination was normal.
Laboratory tests showed normal white blood cell count, haemoglobin (14.2 g/dl) and thrombocytes (183,000 per cubic mm). The C-reactive protein value was high at 55 mg/l and liver function tests revealed cholestasis. An oropharyngeal smear test for COVID-19 was positive. A chest CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower areas.
The patient was admitted and started on i.v. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, low molecular weight heparin and oxygen. On day 4, purpura and epistaxis appeared in the lower extremities. Isolated thrombocytopenia was noted (thrombocytes: 66,000 per cubic mm); this result led to withdrawal of heparin and antibiotics. On day 5, the thrombocyte count was 16,000 per cubic mm and on day 7, 8,000 per cubic mm.
Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times were normal; fibrinogen concentration was 5 g per litre (normal range: 2 to 4). A peripheral blood smear showed less than 1% schistocytes. The thyroid peroxidase antibody value was 245 U per millilitre (normal value < 35); no antinuclear antibodies, antithrombocytic antibodies or antithrombocytic factor 4 were detected.
Immunoglobulin was administered i.v. at a dose of 1 g per kg body weight. After 48 hours, the thrombocyte count decreased to 1,000 per cubic mm and purpuric lesions progressed; this prompted a second administration of immunoglobulin at a dose of 1g per kg. 
A bone marrow aspirate showed normal cellularity with an increase in polymorphous megakaryocytes. Erythroblastic and granulocytic cell lines were normal, with no evidence of haemophagocytosis.
On day 9, the patient reported right frontal headache, without fever, vomiting or neurological focality. A cranial CT scan showed a subarachnoid microhaemorrhage in the right frontal lobe. The thrombocyte count was 2,000 per cubic mm and a thrombocyte transfusion with 100 mg prednisolone was performed; eltrombopag (75 mg per day) was started. 
On day 10, the headache had disappeared, there were no new neurological manifestations and the thrombocyte count had increased to 10,000 per cubic mm. All other laboratory tests had normalised except for fibrinogen, which remained high (3.5 g per litre). On day 13, the thrombocyte count was 139,000 per cubic mm and the purpura had disappeared.
