Anamnesis
Male, 57 years old, with no known drug allergies. Relevant medical and surgical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure with several hospital admissions for decompensation and depression. Follow-up by Internal Medicine due to PAN with idiopathic mononeuritis multiplex. He underwent surgery for perianal fistula years ago. On chronic treatment with beta-blockers, antidepressants and oral corticosteroids.
The patient consulted Primary Care in June 2013 due to asthenia of several weeks' evolution, as well as occasional dyspepsia, with no other accompanying symptoms.

Physical examination
The general physical examination revealed no findings of interest: good general condition, normal colour, hydrated and perfused. Vital signs were in range and afebrile. No peripheral lymph nodes were palpable. Cardiopulmonary auscultation without alterations, abdominal examination was unremarkable. Lower limbs without oedema.

Complementary tests
Blood tests (10/06/2013) showed anaemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dl) with an iron deficiency profile, with no other significant alterations. Gastroscopy (26/06/2013) revealed a 3-4 cm ulcerated vegetating lesion at cardial level, and samples were taken for anatomopathological analysis.
Given the above findings, an abdominal CT scan was performed (08/07/2013) which confirmed a subcardial mass of approximately 4 cm in relation to probable gastric neoplasia without extension to the fat and at least one adenopathy in the gastrohepatic ligament.

Diagnosis
Biopsy reveals moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma of intestinal type.

Treatment
Blood tests (10/06/2013) showed anaemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dl) with an iron deficiency profile, with no other significant alterations, so gastroscopy was performed (26/06/2013), which revealed a 3-4 cm ulcerated vegetating lesion at the cardial level, from which samples were taken. Given the previous finding, an abdominal CT scan was performed (08/07/2013) which confirmed a subcardial mass of approximately 4 cm in relation to probable gastric neoplasia without extension to the fat and at least one adenopathy in the gastrohepatic ligament.

Evolution
In December 2013, asymptomatic elevation of tumour markers Ca 19.9 and Ca 72.4 was detected and PET was performed (02/01/2014), revealing a hypermetabolic lesion in the dome of the liver, segment VIII, of approximately 2.4 cm, suspicious of tumoural vs. infectious aetiology. MRI (24/01/2014) confirms nodular lesion in segment VIII, with ring enhancement, suggestive of necrotic/abscessed metastasis.
Given the anatomical difficulty in performing FNA, the patient was assessed by a multidisciplinary committee and, given the need for histological diagnosis, liver surgery was performed (finally revealing 3 lesions) with biopsies that showed hepatic infiltration by adenocarcinoma in 2/3 of the lesions. Given the progression to this level, HER-2 was requested in order to plan oncospecific treatment, which was positive (+++).
The study was completed with an echocardiogram which was normal and abdominal CT scan (27/03/2018) which showed the 3 hepatic LOE previously described. The first line of cisplatin-capecitabine-trastuzumab was started in April 2018 with a response greater than 50% after 4 cycles, with relevant toxicities including CMV infection requiring hospital admission and water and electrolyte disorders refractory to outpatient management. Given the persistence of these alterations, it was decided to continue with trastuzumab monotherapy from the 5th cycle onwards.
After 7 cycles, the patient continued to respond to CT scans, with only a 1 cm liver lesion persisting.
The case was re-evaluated by the committee and a PET-CT scan was requested to assess surgical salvage, which was finally rejected as the PET-CT scan revealed a peritoneal implant in the mesogastrium, as well as two lymphadenopathies in the pulmonary hilum of dubious aetiology. Trastuzumab monotherapy was continued with stable disease after 12 and 18 cycles. After 22 cycles, there was evidence of complete response by PET-CT and normalisation of tumour markers, so treatment was stopped in July 2015.
In May 2016 (ILP of 10 months), blood tests showed elevated Ca 19.9, with no data of disease in CT, but with evidence in PET-CT of a lesion at the level of the hepatic dome. Second line with 5-FU + trastuzumab was started, with good tolerance and a new complete radiological response after 8 cycles. However, the PET scan continued to show a focus of hypermetabolism (although with a decrease in glucose activity compared to the previous one) at the level of the hepatic dome, so the case was again taken to the multidisciplinary committee and surgery with curative intent was decided.
On 01/03/2017, segment VIII hepatic mastectomy was performed.
The patient is currently undergoing check-ups in outpatient clinics with no data on recurrence.
