A 53-year-old female patient with no relevant history, one sibling with pulmonary tuberculosis. Her illness started five months before admission to the hospital, she presented with general malaise, dyspnoea mMRC 2, cough in attacks, without expectoration, oppressive pain in the anterior chest. Oxygen saturation of 80% on room air, respiratory sounds with crackling rales, predominantly in the infrascapular regions, in both hemithorax. Acropaquia and oedema of the lower limbs ++. Chest X-ray with reticulonodular infiltrates predominantly in the basal regions, with some areas of consolidation. CT scan showed areas of superimposed ground glass with inter- and intra-lobular reticular thickening, basal, parahilar, bilateral. A lung biopsy was performed with a diagnosis of alveolar proteinosis, probably congenital, finding acellular eosinophilic material in alveolar spaces with H/E staining (figure 5A) and PAS-positive material. Treatment with BAL was started on average every four months, with a decrease in symptoms. Two and a half years after diagnosis the patient is stable.
