A 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital whose main symptoms were fever and cough with a course of 9 days. His clinical symptoms did not improve despite anti-inflammatory treatment. Physical examination showed fever with a temperature of 38.6Â°C and the patient had a history of untreated hyperglycaemia. On admission, physical examination revealed pharyngeal congestion and mild bilateral tonsillar swelling. His breath sounds were coarse with no rales. The other physical and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

As for epidemiological information, he had been working at a place a few hundred metres away from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan City, China. He went to that market to buy fruit 11 days before admission. Laboratory tests on the second day of admission showed a low oxygen saturation (60%), a normal pH blood gas (7.446), a normal white blood cell count (6.66x109/L), a high percentage of neutrophils (88.1%) and a low percentage of lymphocytes (6.4%). Serum biochemistry showed low values of total protein (57.6 g/L) and serum albumin (27.4 g/L), high values of glycohaemoglobin (14.1%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (24 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (> 160.0 mg/L) and normal values of interleukin 6 (7.48 pg/mL). All standard microbiological tests, including viral antibody tests, were negative. Chest X-rays and CT scans showed ground-glass opacities and bilateral lung consolidations.

Accordingly, based on epidemiological data, clinical signs and symptoms, analytical and radiological tests, 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed, according to the criteria published by the WHO. During hospitalisation, in addition to symptomatic treatment, the patient was treated with antibiotics (meropenem, linezolid) and antiviral drugs (ganciclovir, oseltamivir). All laboratory tests gradually improved or became normal. The patient recovered and was discharged on day 15 after admission.
