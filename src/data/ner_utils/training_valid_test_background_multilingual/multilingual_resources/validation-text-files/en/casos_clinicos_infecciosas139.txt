A 42-year-old man with stage C3 HIV-1 infection due to previous Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, with poor adherence to treatment. He had undergone several lines of antiretroviral treatment: initially efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, then darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and finally elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. A native of the Czech Republic, he had been living in Spain continuously for the past 15 years. He worked as a keeper of horses and other domestic animals (dogs). He smoked 11 packs/year and drank 40 g of alcohol per day. He reported no drug allergies. He presented to the Emergency Department for a month of progressive onset fever of up to 39oC, associated with dyspnoea on moderate exertion, pleuritic chest pain and brownish expectoration with bloody traces.
Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.2oC, BP 90/50 mmHg, SatO2 92%, breathing room air and a clear sensation of illness, being well perfused and hydrated, and eupneic at rest. No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymph nodes were palpable. He had multiple verrucous lesions on the upper and lower limbs, and lesions compatible with thrush in the oropharynx. He was conscious, oriented, with normal language and cranial nerves, without meningeal signs and with normal muscle balance and osteotendinous reflexes. The cardiac tones were rhythmic with no murmurs and the vesicular murmur was preserved, with no added noises. The abdomen was soft, without masses, visceromegaly or signs of peritoneal irritation. There was no oedema and pulses were symmetrical.
Complementary tests performed in the ED showed haemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, 9,160 leukocytes/mm3 with lymphopenia (230 lymphocytes/mm3) and 316,300 platelets/mm3. The biochemical study was normal, except for C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.26 mg/dl (normal up to 0.5 mg/dl). Urinary sediment showed no abnormalities. Chest X-ray showed a right upper lobe cavitated condensing lesion (LSD). The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 98 beats per minute without repolarisation alterations. Given the complementary tests, the patient was diagnosed with cavitary pneumonia in LSD, with a score of 42 on the FINE scale. He was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward for treatment and diagnostic study, in respiratory isolation.
A microbiological study was performed, requesting blood cultures, Legionella spp and pneumococcus antigenuria, serial smear microscopy and sputum culture (culture of conventional and long incubation bacteria), as well as immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii. The study was completed with serologies for Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., Brucella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, hepatotropic viruses (HAV, HBV and HCV), cytomegalovirus and syphilis. Lymphocyte subpopulations and HIV viral load were also requested. Empirical antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours and clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours, pending microbiological results.


Differential diagnosis
In the case presented, some important aspects must be taken into account in order to establish a correct differential diagnosis. Firstly, this is a patient with HIV infection whose immunovirological status is unknown, as he is a patient with irregular follow-up at the clinic and poor compliance with treatment; secondly, he has a relevant epidemiological history, as he lives with animals (dogs) and works in close contact with other animals, especially horses. The reason for the patient's consultation and the analytical and radiographic findings suggest an infectious aetiology as the first diagnostic hypothesis. Several pathogens should be considered. P. jirovecii. The clinical presentation is very diverse, ranging from a normal chest X-ray to diffuse, interstitial, asymmetric and irregular alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the upper lobes. The most important risk factor is immunosuppression with less than 200 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes.
Bacterial pneumonia. Several microorganisms may be involved, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhodococcus equi and Nocardia asteroides. In relation to cavitated pneumonias, mainly R. equi and N. asteroides should be considered, especially if the course is subacute or chronic and with a very low CD4 lymphocyte count, and especially in this patient, given his epidemiological history as well as the extrapulmonary clinical manifestations. P. aeruginosa cavitated pneumonia can be fulminant, especially if associated with bacteraemia. Other agents involved could be Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis. Tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the most common opportunistic agents affecting patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Apical infiltrates and cavitated disease may be seen, as well as atypical infiltrates, pleural effusions, miliary disease or normal chest radiographs. Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, especially Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) and Mycobacterium kansasii. Active infection with these pathogens should be suspected when the patient is severely immunosuppressed (less than 50 CD4 cells/mm3). Diffuse and local infiltrates, cavitated lesions, nodules, etc. may be seen on chest X-ray. Fungal infection. Agents that may cause cavitary pneumonia include Cryptococcus neoforms, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Penicillium marneffei, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus, among others. Parasitic infection. Highlight T. gondii as an opportunistic agent in patients with less than 100 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes.

Evolution
Study results included negative pneumococcal and Legionella antigenuria, negative serology for Brucella, T. gondii, HAV, HBV, HCV and syphilis, and negative immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a lesion compatible with abscessed pneumonia in LSD, consistent with the image seen in the previous chest X-ray. The immunovirological study showed 217 total lymphocytes/mm3, representing 13 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3 (6%) and 80 CD8 lymphocytes/mm3, with an HIV viral load of 113,526 copies/ml. In view of the immunosuppressed state, prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 160/800 mg three times a week was started.
After five days of hospitalisation, the provisional result of the sputum culture was received, showing abundant growth of R. equi. Serial smears were negative. Antimicrobial treatment was modified according to the antibiogram to imipenem 500 mg every 6 hours, clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours and rifampicin 600 mg per day, and the patient remained afebrile for the next 48 hours. The final sputum culture report showed simultaneous isolation of Serratia plymuthica, so clarithromycin was replaced by levofloxacin. Following this change in antimicrobial therapy, the patient again developed a high fever, which disappeared when clarithromycin was restarted. After one week of antibiotic treatment, antiretroviral therapy, which the patient had voluntarily discontinued for the previous seven months, was restarted with emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and raltegravir. Ten days after starting antibiotic treatment, the patient began with generalised itching and redness of the face, neck and lower limbs, as well as worsening of his skin lesions. Laboratory tests showed progressive eosinophilia, so imipenem, TMP/SMX and clarithromycin were discontinued and antihistamine treatment with hydroxyzine 25 mg per day was started. Subsequently, TMP/SMX and clarithromycin were reintroduced without incident, and oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours was added. The patient had no new episodes of exanthema and the absolute count and percentage of eosinophils normalised.
A biopsy of one of the previously described skin lesions was performed, with negative culture and smear microscopy, and an anatomopathological diagnosis of psoriasiform dermatitis. He was assessed by dermatology, considering the lesions compatible with nodular prurigo and prescribed topical steroids. After three weeks of parenteral treatment, the patient showed significant clinical improvement and was discharged from hospital with clarithromycin and rifampicin until the next consultation.

Final diagnosis
Right upper lobe cavitary pneumonia due to Rhodococcus equi. Stage C3 HIV infection. Oral candidiasis. Psoriasiform dermatitis.
