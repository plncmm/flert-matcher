Anamnesis
A 61-year-old male patient from Peru, with no known drug allergies. His medical and surgical history included HIV stage A2 in treatment with Eviplera, a latent tuberculosis infection treated with isoniazid, syphilis in 2001 treated in Peru, hyperlipidaemia with hepatic steatosis and cutaneous rosacea. She came to the emergency department of our centre with skin lesions of one week's evolution, slightly pruritic, distributed over the thoracic region and subsequently over the upper and lower limbs and penis. He reported a history of pharyngitis two weeks earlier, for which he took amoxicillin and ibuprofen, and diarrhoea one week earlier, which he treated with loperamide. He denies fever or general malaise. One month earlier he had stopped antiretroviral treatment for one week.

Physical examination
Patient in good general condition, afebrile. He has small circular or oval erythematous-violaceous plaques with a darker centre and lighter periphery on both inguinal regions, axillae, shoulders, base of the neck, lumbar region and isolated plaques on the back of the hands, right palm and dorsum of the foot. Some of the plaques are eroded. In the middle region of the balanopreputial sulcus and the base of the glans penis, there is an erythematopardual plaque. In the oral cavity there was erythema of the pharyngeal pillars and small erosion on the left pharyngeal pillar. In the left labial commissure there was a small erosion with an erythematous-violaceous base.

Complementary examinations
Blood tests with haemogram and biochemistry: no significant alterations. Syphilis serology and Mycoplasma IgM negative.
Biopsy with 4mm punch of a lesion in the inguinal region: an epidermis with orthokeratotic and parakeratotic keratinisation, necrotic keratinocytes in the basal layer and foci of vacuolar degeneration. In the superficial dermis there is a slight perivascular and lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of lymphocytes with some eosinophils and areas of epidermal exocytosis, as well as colloid bodies and melanophages. The mid dermis shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with a lymphocyte predominance and some eosinophilic granulocytes. The deep dermis shows no significant histological alterations. Conclusion: Histology compatible with fixed drug-induced exanthema.

Diagnosis
Based on the data from the anamnesis and physical examination, as well as the compatible skin biopsy, the diagnostic suspicion of multiple fixed drug exanthem is established.

Treatment
It is recommended to avoid drugs suspected of triggering the symptoms and antihistamine treatment is prescribed with cetirizine 10mg every 24 hours for as long as the pruritus persists.

Evolution
The lesions resolved with residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
The patient was referred to the Allergology Department to determine the drug causing the symptoms. A patch test was performed with the potentially suspect drugs (amoxicillin, ibuprofen and loperamide), and was negative for all three drugs. However, given the low sensitivity of this test with some drugs, its negativity is not indicative of misdiagnosis.
