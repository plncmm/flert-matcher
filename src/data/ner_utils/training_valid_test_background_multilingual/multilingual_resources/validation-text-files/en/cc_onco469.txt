Anamnesis
Personal history
Male, 51 years old, with no medical or surgical history of interest. ECOG 0. Not receiving chronic treatment. Adequate social and family support.

Oncological history
Diagnosed in April 2018 (50 years old) of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma (8th edition AJJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 2017), PD-L1 60%, with no evidence of molecular alterations in EGFR, ALK and ROS-1.
Initiated first-line treatment with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks), achieving partial response after the 4th cycle. She received a total of 10 cycles until December 2018, maintaining response.

Current history
In January 2019, after the 11th cycle, she consulted the emergency department for febrile fever, with no clinical signs of infectious focus. Laboratory tests showed mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.60 mg/dl). Complicated infection/obstructive cause was ruled out (abdominal ultrasound) and, on observing a slight initial improvement with parenteral hydration, given the suspicion of lower urinary tract infection with associated pre-renal failure, outpatient management with broad-spectrum antibiotherapy was decided (negative urine cultures), after which the febrile fever subsided and renal function improved.
Subsequently, he received 2 additional cycles of pembrolizumab. Then the febrile fever reappeared and, in March 2019, she consulted the emergency department again, in this case for a fever peak of up to 38Â°C. In the previous days-weeks, he also presented with acute left-sided gonalgia with inflammatory features and polyuria (estimated diuresis of approximately 3 l of urine), with no clear nocturnal predominance or evident pharmacological cause.

Physical examination
On examination, he was febrile (38oC). There were signs of mucocutaneous dehydration and monoarthritis of the left knee, with marked inflammation and functional impotence.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests showed severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 2.60 mg/dl) with no response to fluid therapy and no evidence of obstruction (abdominal ultrasound); together with profound uncompensated hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis (pH 7.19; HCO3- 14.5 mEq/l; pCO2 30 mm Hg; chloride 110 mEq/l) and potassium levels at the lower limit of normality (K+ 3.5 mEq/l). Urine examination confirmed polyuria (24-hour urine volume: 4.5 l) and showed inadequate acid-base and ionic compensation (urinary pH > 6.5; urinary GAP anion 22), as well as aseptic leukocyturia (nitrates, bacteria and cultures negative). Renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis study revealed hyperaldosteronism (aldosterone: 336 pg/ml; renin activity 22.8 ng/ml/h). Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out. Overall, the findings were compatible with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and proximal renal tubular acidosis/type II.
The study of the synovial fluid extracted from the inflamed joint (left knee) showed a very marked inflammatory pattern (opaque appearance, decreased philance, glucose consumption, increased protein, leukocytes 50,000/ul). Microcrystalline and infectious arthritis was ruled out. The haemogram showed normocytic-normochromic (inflammatory) anaemia and leukocytosis with neutrophilia and absolute monocytosis, as well as reactive thrombocytosis. Acute phase reactants (CRP, ESR) were elevated. Subsequent autoimmune testing showed positive antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) at a high titre (1/160), as well as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (aCCP) values more than 2 times the upper limit of normal (RF: 25 IU/mL, aCCP: 147.4 IU/mL). Serological criteria were compatible with rheumatoid arthritis.
Since both complications were immune-mediated (common aetiologies were ruled out: infectious, pharmacological), coincided in time and had an unequivocal temporal sequence with pembrolizumab, they were attributed to the anti-PD-1 antibody.

Diagnosis
Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis, proximal renal tubular acidosis/type II and inflammatory monoarthritis with serological criteria for rheumatoid arthritis secondary to pembrolizumab.

Treatment
High-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) were initiated, along with vigorous hydroelectrolyte and acid-base support to replenish renal fluid, potassium and bicarbonate losses (> 1 mEq/kg/day), as well as non-nephrotoxic analgesia for joint pain control.

Evolution
During the first days of treatment, the evolution was favourable. Laboratory tests showed the beginning of recovery of creatinine clearance, as well as a significant decrease in parenteral bicarbonate and potassium requirements, to levels that allowed the patient to switch to oral supplementation. There was also normalisation of the haemogram and a generalised decrease in all inflammatory markers. Clinically, the patient remained afebrile with remission of gonarthrosis.
Given the substantial improvement, follow-up continued on an outpatient basis, with a slowly progressive decrease in the corticosteroid dose and continuous improvement in the analytical parameters. Coinciding with a decrease in the corticosteroid dose (prednisone < 10 mg/day), he again presented another episode of severe metabolic acidosis that required further hospital admission. At this point, it was decided not to restart pembrolizumab treatment definitively, given the unresolved grade 2 immune-mediated toxicity.
At his last re-evaluation in June 2019, on treatment with low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 10 mg/day), the patient has a creatinine level of around 0.80 mg/dl, a pH above 7.20 and adequate serum bicarbonate and potassium levels with oral supplementation. The oncological disease remains in a maintained partial response without requiring the initiation of a second line of treatment.
