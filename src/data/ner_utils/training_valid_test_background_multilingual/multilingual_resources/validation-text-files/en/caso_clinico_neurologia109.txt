Anamnesis
A 36-year-old man with a history of recurrent rhinosinusitis and spontaneous pneumothorax. He was an active smoker, occasional cannabis user and former cocaine user (nasal and smoked). He came to the emergency department for a 7-day history of severe, continuous headache (also nocturnal), located in the right periocular region. In the last few days the pain had intensified, becoming holocranial and associated with tearing of the right eye, evening shivering and fever with peaks of 40°C. She had nausea and some nausea and vomiting. He had experienced nausea and some vomiting, which the patient associated with taking ibuprofen. He did not report flu-like symptoms, myalgias or symptoms at other levels. Apparently, 2 months earlier he had suffered a similar picture, with right ocular headache, in the evening, with the same characteristics as the current episode but without fever, which had subsided spontaneously in about 10 days.

Physical examination
The general physical examination revealed a febrile, asthenic patient, although in good general condition. Neurological examination revealed end nuchal rigidity and bilateral positive Lassègue manoeuvre. There was pain on palpation of the right eye and paranasal sinuses, and pain with eye movements. The rest of the neurological and apparatus examination showed no alterations at any level, except for a septic mouth with the presence of caries.

Complementary tests
- Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (21,000/mcl) with a left shift, CRP and procalcitonin significantly elevated, and significant coagulation abnormalities. A Rose Bengal test was requested, which was negative.
- A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, in which only the presence of small, sparse extracerebral air bubbles in the right frontal region was notable.
- A lumbar puncture revealed the presence of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (220 leukocytes/field) with a predominance of segmented (95%), protein of 86 mg/dl and glucose in the normal range. Gram stain was negative. With the diagnosis of acute meningitis due to an unaffiliated germ, empirical broad-spectrum treatment (ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin) was prescribed.

Diagnosis
Frontal subdural empyema and aseptic meningitis related to parameningeal focus, secondary to pansinusitis.

Treatment
24 hours after admission, and due to a clinical worsening with a tendency to somnolence, a new CT scan centred on the sinuses was requested, which showed right pansinusitis associated with right frontal subdural empyema of 5 mm, with air in its interior due to a connection with the right frontal sinus. An assessment by Otorhinolaryngology was requested, and he underwent urgent surgery with opening and drainage of the right maxillary, ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, the Neurosurgery Department deciding to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. Due to a new clinical worsening and an epileptic seizure, a new cranial CT scan was performed, which showed persistent occupation of the right paranasal sinuses and an increase in the size of the empyema (13 mm) with a deviation of the cerebral midline of approximately 6 mm, as well as two frontal cortical hypodense foci compatible with cerebral infarcts. After urgent drainage of the empyema, successive CT scans showed extension of the empyema to the right temporal level, insinuating itself into the parietal convexity, which necessitated reoperation and a very wide craniectomy.
The culture of CSF and purulent material extracted from both the empyema and the drained sinuses was negative, but the patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 8 weeks, with good clinical evolution. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed substantial reduction of the empyema at the temporal level.

Evolution
Subsequent follow-up MRI showed radiological improvement of the empyema, but the pansinusitis persisted. He was discharged pending reoperation for the placement of a cranial vault implant. As a sequel to the episode he suffers from symptomatic epilepsy which is being treated.
