A 63-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension under treatment, consulted for a back lesion of 4 days' evolution, very pruritic.

On physical examination, there was an erythematous plaque of 6 cm in a major axis on the back, with two eccentric crusty lesions. Erythematous plaque 6 cm long on the back, with two eccentric crusty lesions. Dermoscopy revealed the presence of a tick in one of the crusted lesions.

The parasite was completely removed and oral doxycycline and topical clobetasol were prescribed, with complete resolution of the symptoms.

Ticks are haematophagous arthropods of the class Arachnida and subclass Acarina, and can be taxonomically divided into 2 families: Ixodidae and Argasidae. The family Ixodidae includes the hard ticks, named after the thickening of their cuticle like a sclerotised cuticle, and comprises the genera Ixodes, Amblyomma, Hemaphisalys, Hyalomma, Dermacentor, Boophilus and Rhipicephalus. The family Argasidae includes the soft ticks, characterised by their soft coraceous integument, and includes the genera Ornithodoros, Argas, and Otobius. In Chile, the species Rhiphicephalus sanguineus, also known as the brown dog tick, is the most prevalent species.

Diagnosis
Tick infestation should be suspected when there are characteristic skin lesions, associated with an epidemiological history of contact with infested animals or travel to endemic areas.

Treatment
The treatment of choice is removal of the tick with tweezers, taking special care not to compress the body of the parasite too much. The use of a single application of permethrin 5% at night is also described.
