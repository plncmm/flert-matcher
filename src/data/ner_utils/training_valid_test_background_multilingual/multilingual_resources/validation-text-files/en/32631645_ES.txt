Two of her three caregiver children had started with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, so we performed a PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in this patient, as she was the most vulnerable and most likely to be transferred to a social health centre if the PCR was negative, in order to ensure proper isolation of the main caregivers. The PCR in nasopharyngeal exudate was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 1 April 2020. On questioning the family regarding symptoms, the children informed us that our patient only presented with febrile fever (maximum temperature 37.5°C) on 23 March 2020, with no other accompanying symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection.
Home isolation measures were indicated, we decided to discontinue treatment with methotrexate due to its immunosuppressive effects, and we began outpatient follow-up of the patient, so that telephone interviews were conducted with caregivers every 48 hours during the first week after diagnosis and every 24 hours during the second week. Throughout the follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, afebrile and with no changes in her baseline condition.
