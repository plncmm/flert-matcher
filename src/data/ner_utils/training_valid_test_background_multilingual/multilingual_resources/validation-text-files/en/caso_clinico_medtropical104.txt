The first case of anisakiasis in Colombia is described and the available medical literature is summarised. A 52-year-old woman consulted for acute epigastric pain with abrupt onset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and urticaria after consuming fish.
Physical examination revealed moderate tenderness in the epigastrium. Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis, while plain radiography and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The diagnosis was made by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed thickening of the gastric wall and a moving parasite. An Anisakis larva was found and removed endoscopically, which relieved the patient's pain.
Clinically, anisakiasis can present as a gastric, intestinal, other systemic or allergic disease. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the patient's dietary history and direct visualisation of the larvae; the only effective treatment is their endoscopic removal.
Anisakiasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish or shellfish infected with nematodes of the genera Anisakis, Pseudoterranova and Contracaecum.
