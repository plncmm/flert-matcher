Anamnesis
A 29-year-old male patient with no previous family or medical-surgical history of interest, nor relevant medication at home, presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back, progressive increase in abdominal perimeter and weight loss of about 9 kg over three months of evolution. During this time, he visited the emergency department twice and was discharged after finding no signs of alarm or analytical alterations. In December 2017, he again presented with further clinical deterioration and tension ascites. He was then admitted to the Digestive Department.

Physical examination
On examination, the patient was in good general condition, although his marked thinness and appearance of illness was striking. On abdominal palpation, ascitic swelling was evident, with tension ascites and pain on diffuse palpation without peritoneal irritation, masses or megaliths. No lymph node level lymphadenopathy was palpable, nor were there any other relevant findings on physical examination.

Complementary tests
Serial laboratory tests performed during admission showed no abnormalities other than slightly elevated CRP and LDH. The proteinogram and all viral serologies performed (including HIV, hepatotropic, CMV, EBV, herpesvirus and parvovirus) were also normal.
Ascitic fluid after paracentesis showed no tumour cells or other significant findings.
A thoracoabdominal pelvic examination was performed, which revealed a notable right pleural effusion, pleural thickening, multiple axillary, mediastinal, pulmonary hilar, intra-abdominal adenopathies (with a 5 cm celiac-periportal adenopathic conglomerate), gastric, spleen and spleen adenopathic conglomerate, gastric, splenic, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric areas that offered radiological suspicion of extensive lymphoproliferative syndrome, and osteosclerotic foci in dorsal vertebrae D1-D11-D12, sternal manubrium and at costal level. A marked thickening with increased multinodular density of the greater omentum was also observed, so an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EDA) was also requested, in which a rounded, ulcerated lesion of about 4 cm, suspicious of neoplasia, was visualised in the gastric body. During colonoscopy, along the course of the endoscope, several areas of extrinsic compression of the mucosa were found, which looked as if they might correspond to peritoneal implants.
Biopsy samples were taken from the EDA and colonoscopy findings, both of which were negative for malignancy. In this case, the diagnosis was obtained by biopsy of an axillary lymph node.

Diagnosis
The anatomopathological study concluded: lymph node with infiltration by malignant neoplasia suggestive of desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSCLC) supported by immunohistochemical study with positive expression for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CKAE1/AE3, vimentin, neuronal specific enolase and with focal positivity in dot like pattern for desmin, as well as the presence of fusion of the EWSR1/WT1 gene.
Based on these data, the patient was finally diagnosed with stage IV intra-abdominal CRPD due to pleural, polyadenopathic, peritoneal and bone involvement.

Treatment
After discharge, the patient was evaluated in an oncology consultation, and it was decided to refer the patient to our Sarcoma Reference Unit at the hospital for assessment and treatment.
Palliative chemotherapy with a combination of vincristine-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide-cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide-etoposide for six cycles according to tolerance was proposed as the first therapeutic strategy.

Evolution
The patient started the above treatment in January 2018. To date, he has received four cycles with good tolerance, without relevant toxicities (only grade 2 nausea), or analytical alterations that have led to a delay in the cycles or dose reduction. After the second cycle, she went to the emergency department with an increase in cough, sudden dyspnoea and general malaise, and the condition was classified as an infectious process, having previously ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). To date, she has required four evacuating paracentesis, with extraction of about 8 litres in each of them, achieving subsequent clinical improvement. She maintains an ECOG PS of 1.
A re-evaluation CT scan was performed, showing a partial response to the disease. She is still waiting to receive the remaining two cycles to complete six.
