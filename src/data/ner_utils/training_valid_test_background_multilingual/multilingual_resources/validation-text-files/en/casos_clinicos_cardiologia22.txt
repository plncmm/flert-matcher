A 9-year-old girl was hospitalised with fever and headache for two days. She was being followed up for a small congenital VSD (diameter 3 mm). She had no history of dental or surgical procedures. On physical examination, body temperature: 38.5°C, respiratory rate: 20/min, pulse: 110/min, blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg. An intense holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and signs of nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig's signs were also noted. The child had no other relevant features. She had no subungual haemorrhages, no splenomegaly and no obvious focal neurological impairment. Laboratory data were as follows: leucocyte count 17 000/mm3; neutrophils 93 %; lymphocytes 5 %; haemoglobin 12.7 g/dl; thrombocytes 225 000/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 40 mm/h and C-reactive protein 10 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) count was 22 neutrophils/mm3, 66 lymphocytes/mm3, protein content 26 mg/dl and glucose 61 mg/dl. MRI was unremarkable. Ceftriaxone was started due to suspicion of meningitis after a lumbar puncture. By day 3 of hospitalisation, symptoms had completely resolved. Once negative results were obtained on CSF Gram stain, PCR panel for bacterial/viral meningitis, blood culture and urine culture, ceftriaxone was discontinued and the patient was discharged on day 7. Two days later, she was readmitted with fever (39.5°C) and stiff neck. Laboratory tests showed the following: leucocytes 25 000/mm3 (92 % neutrophils with toxic granulations), haemoglobin 11 g/dl, thrombocytes 216 000/mm3, ESR 55 mm/h and C-reactive protein 16 mg/dl. On physical examination, no obvious source of fever was found. The family refused CSF examination. An echocardiogram was performed to detect the origin of the fever and found tricuspid valve endocarditis with vegetation (10.7 mm x 6.6 mm) and VSD (diameter 3 mm) with left to right shunt. Cranial CT scan was normal. On follow-up, the nuchal rigidity resolved within 24 hours. Two consecutive blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and teicoplanin and gentamicin were started. Vegetation on the tricuspid valve caused valvular insufficiency and was removed by heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, including tricuspid valvuloplasty four weeks later. Antibiotics were discontinued after six weeks, after blood cultures were negative for two weeks. The patient was discharged with residual mild tricuspid regurgitation. She was symptom-free during the one-year follow-up.
