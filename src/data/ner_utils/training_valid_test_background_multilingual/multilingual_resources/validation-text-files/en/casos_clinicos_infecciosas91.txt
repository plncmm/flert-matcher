We present the case of a 71-year-old patient who came to the Emergency Department for altered speech accompanied by oppressive headache, altered sensitivity in the peribuccal region and loss of strength in the left hemibody, with no other symptoms or signs. The patient was active and independent in basic activities of daily living and had an excellent cognitive level. His medical history includes arterial hypertension with good control with an antihypertensive drug, heavy smoking until the age of 35 (ICAT 50 packs/year) without an alcohol habit and pulmonary lesions due to direct contact with asbestos from his work as an electrician, for which he is being monitored by Pneumology. He underwent surgery for basal cell carcinoma of the scalp and left inguinal hernia. The patient was specifically questioned about symptoms related to possible constitutional symptoms that he had not presented, and epidemiological history of interest, denying contact with animals, recent travel, transfusions and risky sexual practices.

On examination the patient was in good general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative, well hydrated and perfused. Normotensive (BP 130/65 mmHg), eupneic at rest at 12 rpm maintaining oxygen saturation of 98%, breathing on room air, rhythmic at 70 bpm with normal cardiorespiratory auscultation except for fine crackles in the bases already known from his history. Examination by apparatus and systems revealed no findings in the head and neck, depressible abdomen, not painful on palpation, no defence or peritonism, palpation of discrete hepatosplenomegaly of 1-2 fingers, no findings in the lower limbs or skin lesions.
The neurological examination revealed bradylinearity but no dysphasia or dysarthria; left supranuclear facial paralysis, with the rest of the cranial nerves unaltered; and a 4/5 decrease in muscle strength in the left upper limb, with no loss of sensation or gait alterations. Initial laboratory studies revealed a slight elevation of transaminases (GOT 61 U/l, GPT 41 U/l) with all other parameters within normal limits (glycaemia, creatinine, urea, ions, bilirubin, haemogram, coagulation and venous gases).
The chest X-ray showed signs compatible with chronic bronchopathy and the electrocardiogram showed no alterations of interest. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the skull showed a space-occupying lesion (LOE) in the right frontal region, round and hypodense, measuring 12 mm with annular enhancement after contrast administration, surrounded by a hypodense digitiform area related to oedema, with no other lesions or alterations in the bone structures. In view of the clinical and radiological findings, it was decided to admit the patient to Internal Medicine to complete the study.


Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of cerebral LOE with contrast uptake in the ring should include a series of conditions that can be grouped mainly into 4 aetiological groups:

1. tumoural: both primary neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) and metastases of other primary tumours.
- Metastases are the most common CNS tumours in adults, with lung cancer being the most common primary tumour metastasis, followed by breast, colorectal and melanoma. They are iso or hypointense lesions in T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences, characterised by the formation of a large amount of vasogenic oedema and contrast uptake with a variable pattern (with ring enhancement, heterogeneous, uniform, nodular) and may contain blood or necrosis depending on the origin of the primary tumour.
- Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary intracranial neoplasm in adults, with a heterogeneous appearance, hyperintense in T2 with vasogenic oedema surrounding the lesion and enhancement after contrast administration.
- Primary cerebral lymphoma, a variant of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, usually appears as iso or hyperdense lesions with a differentiated behaviour depending on the immunocompetence of the patient, with a thick peripheral enhancement in the immunocompromised patient versus a markedly homogeneous enhancement in the immunocompetent patient.

Infectious: mainly pyogenic abscesses, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cerebral tuberculosis (TB) infection and neurocysticercosis.
- Toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection of the CNS that occurs especially in immunocompromised patients and usually presents as multiple lesions, although they may be single, with a hypodense centre and raised borders with ring-like enhancement, although they may present as hyperdense lesions with solid enhancement.
- CNS tuberculoma is a rare form of infection in patients with tuberculosis and occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients; they usually present as single lesions of variable size, usually located in the frontal and parietal lobes, with ring enhancement and significant surrounding vasogenic oedema.
- Neurocysticercosis in its initial, non-cystic stage should also be considered in the differential diagnosis as it can be observed as a localised focus of oedema with ring enhancement after contrast administration, although a correct anamnesis usually helps us to orientate the picture.
- Brain abscesses are parenchymal infections that can occur due to contiguity of a pericranial focus (otitis, sinusitis, dental infection), haematogenous dissemination from a distal focus or secondary to trauma or surgery. The aetiology depends on these foci, with Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus being the most frequently implicated micro-organisms. The level of immunocompetence of the patient must also be taken into account, as germs such as Listeria spp, Nocardia spp, Aspergillus spp, Cryptococcus spp and Mucor spp may be involved, as well as the possibility of foreign travel (Tapeworm solium, Entamoeba histolytica, Schistosoma, Salmonella, Coccidioides). Abscesses usually present as supratentorial lesions (frontal and parietal lobes) with radiological findings depending on the stage of formation (early cerebritis, late cerebritis, early capsule, late capsule), usually highlighting ring contrast uptake.

3. Inflammatory: this group includes multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease characterised by perivenous inflammation, demyelination and gliosis. It is characterised by solitary or multiple lesions with oedema and inflammation, which capture contrast in the form of an incomplete ring or horseshoe shape towards the grey matter.

4. Vascular: acute cerebral ischaemia presents as a hyperintense lesion in T2 with ring enhancement after contrast administration, being of utmost importance the study of tissue perfusion in acute cases to detect areas of potentially recoverable penumbra. In our case, given the patient's symptoms and personal history, we focused on tumour and infectious causes, initially ruling out inflammatory and vascular conditions.


Evolution
During admission, it was decided to complete the study begun in the emergency department with a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which confirmed the presence of a rounded right frontoparietal lesion, with a diameter of 3 cm, located at the cortico-subcortical level, with significant associated oedema and discrete compression of the right lateral ventricle. The lesion showed a hypointense signal in T1 and hyperintense in T2 with fine, uniform and complete ring enhancement after gadolinium administration, with marked restriction in the diffusion study; findings suggestive of brain abscess. At the same time, a thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, which ruled out tumour lesions although it showed findings compatible with chronic liver disease, slightly increased portal calibre (15 mm) and moderate splenomegaly (17 cm), with no other noteworthy findings. The complete blood test requested on admission, which included serology for HIV, HBV, HCV and Toxoplasma, detected discrete coagulopathy with prothrombin complex deficiency and platelet count of 38,000 platelets/microL; as well as past HBV infection and positive antibodies for HCV, so HCV viral load was requested, detecting 2,020,000 copies in the blood. In view of these findings, brain abscess was considered as the first diagnostic possibility in a patient with previously unknown chronic HCV infection. Blood cultures were taken without fever, which showed bacteraemia due to Listeria monocytogenes, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was requested to rule out cardiological origin, which showed slight left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction, ruling out vegetations. In view of the microbiological evidence, it was decided to modify antibiotic therapy to ampicillin associated with gentamicin for 6 weeks (until then, treatment with ceftriaxone, metronidazole and ampicillin). Neurologically, the patient's symptoms worsened and it was decided to drain the abscess after discussing the case with the Neurosurgery Department, aspirating the abscess and instilling antibiotic serum under ultrasound control, which was subsequently aspirated without removing the abscess capsule given the high risk of haemorrhage due to the plateletopenia that the patient developed during admission. Samples were sent to Anatomical Pathology and Microbiology (bacteria, mycobacteria, slow-growing microorganisms, fungi and parasites), with only Listeria monocytogenes growing in the abscess culture with the same antimicrobial profile as that detected in the blood. From a neurological point of view, the patient had a good clinical evolution with complete recovery after surgery. As a complication, the patient developed episodes of hyperglycaemia during admission that required control with insulin, and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus in relation to chronic liver disease. With regard to HCV infection, the patient was reinterrogated about possible routes of transmission, probably related to blood transfusion in childhood. Viral genotyping was performed, detecting genotype 1b, and an abdominal ultrasound scan showed a cirrhotic liver without focal lesions with portal hypertension and splenomegaly; upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed small oesophageal varices without gastric varices or gastropathy of portal hypertension. There was no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy or renal damage. In the context of the infectious picture, the patient presented hydropic decompensation with tension ascites and oedema in the lower limbs and genitals, requiring evacuating paracentesis (drainage of 8 L of clear fluid) without subsequent complications or new episodes of decompensation.
A cryoglobulinemia study was requested, which was positive, as well as an autoimmunity study, which was negative. CHILD B6 was calculated with the above data and it was decided to start treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir one tablet daily. During admission, the patient developed acute tubular necrosis, so gentamicin had to be withdrawn and it was decided to discontinue sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (considering changing to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir as it is an antiviral treatment that does not require renal adjustment; although it has not yet been started pending evaluation by the Digestive System). The evolution in outpatient consultations has been favourable, with evident improvement of the brain abscess in the control MRI after completion of intravenous antibiotherapy, although with persistent perilesional oedema in probable relation to the capsule that it was decided not to remove during surgery, so it was decided to prolong antibiotherapy with linezolid for 4 more weeks. At subsequent check-ups, the brain imaging has completely resolved.

Final diagnosis
- Frontal abscess due to Listeria monocytogenes with associated bacteraemia in a patient with unknown chronic HCV infection.
- CHILD B6 liver cirrhosis due to HCV genotype 1B with first hydropic decompensation, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, small oesophageal varices and cryoglobulinaemia.
- Unknown type 2 diabetes mellitus.
