A 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with fever, cough, expectoration, diarrhoea and dyspnoea during the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in Daegu (South Korea). The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19. Troponin I was 1.26 ng/mL (< 0.3 ng/mL) and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide was 1929 pg/mL (< 125 pg/mL). Chest radiography revealed multifocal consolidation in both lung fields and cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed non-specific intraventricular conduction delay and several premature ventricular complexes. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular (LV) systolic impairment. Thoracic CT revealed multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, in the lower lobe and with peripheral dominant distribution. On cardiac CT, the coronary arteries were normal and the myocardium showed hypertrophy due to oedema combined with endocardial perfusion abnormality in the lateral left ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse high signal intensity (SI) in the LV myocardium assessed on the STIR sequence (ratio of myocardial SI to skeletal muscle = 2.2) and myocardial wall thickening (LV mass index: 111.3 g/m2), suggesting myocardial parietal oedema. On the imaging sequence, native T1 (medial septum 1431 ms; lateral wall 1453 ms; reference value ∼1150 ms) and extracellular volume (medial septum 29.7%; lateral wall 61%; reference value ∼25%) showed diffuse enhancement. Extensive transparietal detection of late enhancement was performed with gadolinium. Myocarditis combined with COVID-19 was confirmed by multimodality imaging.
