A 15-year-old patient, with no past history of interest, consulted for symptoms of generalised urticaria, dysphonia, dyspnoea and a feeling of dizziness one hour after ingesting ibuprofen and two hours after eating macaroni with tomato and orange. Subsequently, the patient presented another episode of generalised urticaria, lip angioedema and dyspnoea three hours after eating an orange and consuming alcohol, during the reaction he was doing physical exercise. In both episodes the patient had smoked Cannabis sativa. The allergological study (intraepidermal tests, determination of specific IgE and molecular study) was positive for pollens, epithelia and orange. The prickby-prick against Cannabis sativa was also positive (with negative controls). Tryptase at 60 minutes after the episodes 23.9 mcg/L and 10.1 mcg/L, first and second episodes respectively, with normal baseline tryptase. Subsequent to the reactions the patient has tolerated macaroni, tomato, orange, ibuprofen and Cannabis sativa adequately. The immunoblot detected a band (<14kDa) against orange extract.
