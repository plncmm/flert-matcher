The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and chronic renal failure, hospitalised because of dyspnoea. Vital signs at the time of referral were: pressure = 100/75, pulse = 105 bpm, respiratory rate: 18 r.p.m., temperature = 37 and oxygen saturation (in room air) = 87%. There were crackles in both lungs, but the rest of the examination was normal. Because of lung involvement and dyspnoea, the patient was treated with oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, meronepem, dexamethasone and enoxaparin with adjustment for serum creatinine. The patient was seen by a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. ECG and echocardiography revealed no abnormalities and blood glucose was closely monitored. According to the recommendations, the patient was also treated with corticosteroids. The troponin I test result was negative and the creatinine concentration was 1.5 mg/dL. No electrolyte disturbances were observed during hospitalisation. After 7 days with improvement of symptoms and saturation up to 95% in the last 48 hours, it was decided that the patient could continue quarantine in a rehabilitation centre. The following day, after being transferred in good general condition and with normal vital signs, she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and died as she did not respond to resuscitation.
