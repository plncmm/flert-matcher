A 47-year-old woman, a teacher, resident in our country, consulted for presenting with macular, circular, erythematous skin lesions, some oedematous and with increased local temperature, on the extremities. As background, he reported having travelled three weeks ago to Pennsylvania, a state in the northeast of the USA with large expanses of forest, where he had been engaged in outdoor activities. Two days after his return to Santiago, he presented with jaw pain, headache and intense cervical pain, which he treated with oral ibuprofen for a week and then with cyclobenzaprine. On the sixth day he presented the first cutaneous macula on the right arm, to which others were progressively added. One week later, she developed an unquantified fever, general malaise, insomnia and pain in both wrists and knees.

Physical dermatological examination revealed multiple large erythematous target-like erythematous macules (up to 20 cm in greatest diameter), in different stages of evolution. The largest lesion was located on the posterior aspect of the left thigh, with increased local temperature, oedema and burning sensation to the touch, compatible with erythema migrans multiplex. Erythema migrans multiplex at different stages of evolution. Lesions on the dorsal aspect of the thighs. Erythema migrans multiplex at different stages of evolution. Lesions on the trunk. 

Given the clinical picture and epidemiological history, early disseminated Lyme disease was diagnosed. Treatment was started with doxycycline 100 mg orally, fractionated every 12 h, for 21 days, cetirizine 10 mg orally daily and hydrocortisone 1% topical lotion, twice daily.

IgM and IgG serology for Borrelia burgdorferi was requested and performed at the Clinical Laboratory of Red de Salud UC Christus. As screening, antibodies were detected by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (VidasR) 13 and confirmed by western blot (MarDxR), showing three bands for B. burgdorferi proteins in IgM (positive = two bands or more) and seven bands in IgG (positive = five or more)5. At the end of treatment, the skin lesions improved, maintaining a mild purplish erythema on both thighs and general symptoms, although she persisted with mild pain in the forearms and fingers and paresthesia in the lips. Residual post antimicrobial treatment erythema on posterior thighs. Directed neurological and cardiological evaluation ruled out systemic Lyme disease involvement.
