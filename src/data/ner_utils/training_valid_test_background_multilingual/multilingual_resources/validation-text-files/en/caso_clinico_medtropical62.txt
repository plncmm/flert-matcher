In October 2016, a 56-year-old female patient of Argentine nationality from Villa Huidobro, Córdoba province, was admitted to Sanatorio Allende with a febrile condition associated with headache, muscle weakness and maculopapular exanthema.

Six days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient was in the province of San Juan on a recreational trip. The patient reported that after an excursion to a rural area she removed a tick from her left leg. On admission the patient was in good general condition but febrile (39°C). Physical examination revealed a generalised, non-pruritic, maculopapular and papulovesicular rash, affecting the trunk and extremities, and a brownish-black inoculation eschar in the area where the tick was removed. In view of the history of tick bite, serum samples and biopsy of the scab were referred to the Special Bacteriology Service, INEI-ANLIS "Carlos G. Malbrán" for detection of antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and search for Rickettsia spp. by PCR. The patient was treated empirically with doxycycline (200mg/24h for 6 days). Fever resolved within 48h after initiation of treatment and complete remission of symptoms occurred within 6 days. Results of serological and PCR tests confirmed the diagnosis: indirect immunofluorescence: reactive IgG (>1:256); reactive IgM (>1:64); amplification and partial sequencing of 23S-5S rRNA and ompA genes showed 100% identity with R. parkeri reference strains available in GenBank. parkeri reference strains available in GenBank, accession numbers: KJ796432.1, CP003341.1 and MG574938.1, MF737606.1, respectively.
