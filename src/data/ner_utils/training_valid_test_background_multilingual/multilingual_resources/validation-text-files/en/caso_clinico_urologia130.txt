Anamnesis
A 48-year-old man, with no past history of interest, came to the emergency department with abdominal pain, fever, difficulty in passing stools and the onset of micturition of 2 weeks' duration.

Physical examination
Abdomen: soft, depressible, painful on palpation in the right iliac fossa and hypogastrium. Rectal examination: slightly enlarged prostate of normal consistency, slightly painful on palpation.

Complementary tests
- Abdominal X-ray: signs of punctate nodular metal density which, due to their distribution, suggest diverticula with barium content, although they could also correspond to the remains of shrapnel or pellets.
- Biochemistry: C-reactive protein 24.5 mg/dl, creatinine 1.55 mg/dl, the rest normal. Urine system: microhaematuria. Haemogram: no alterations.

Diagnosis
Acute prostatitis.

Treatment
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours for 21 days.

Evolution
Four days later, the patient was readmitted for persistent clinical manifestations, associated with right buttock pain radiating to the thigh, functional limitation of the ipsilateral hip and pollakiuria. Blood and urine tests remained unchanged, with negative urine and blood cultures. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an abscess of the right iliac psoas, which was treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotherapy and percutaneous drainage of the collection. Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium was isolated. Despite having been discharged with oral antibiotic therapy with three antibiotics adjusted to the antibiogram, he was readmitted on two further occasions due to recurrence and persistence of fever. A new percutaneous puncture was attempted, but no fluid material was obtained.
A follow-up CT scan one month after the last admission revealed a hypodense area measuring 4.8 x 1.6 cm in the most medial portion of the right psoas, diverticula of the sigma with signs of acute diverticulitis and contact of the sigma with the ipsilateral psoas, which he attributed as the origin of the abscess.
During the following months, the patient attended the emergency department on numerous occasions for clinical symptoms compatible with urinary infection, microhaematuria and pyuria, as well as persistent abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, exacerbated by valsalva when passing stool; he was treated with various broad-spectrum antibiotics, due to the finding of Escherichia coli BLEE, with no clinical improvement. Finally, the patient was assessed in the Urology Department for irritative micturition symptoms, and an ultrasound scan of the urinary tract was performed, which revealed mucosal thickening, as well as cystoscopy, which revealed oedema of the bladder floor of probable extrinsic origin.
Given the persistent clinical picture, it was decided to perform an opaque enema, with evidence of diverticula and no evidence of diverticulitis, and a second CT scan, which showed thickening of the wall of the right ureter, without dilatation, secondary to the pre-existing psoas abscess, as well as the presence of a non-specific hyperdense linear image in the interior of the bladder.
Finally, he underwent diagnostic flexible cystoscopy, which revealed a toothpick that was removed using foreign body forceps. After its removal, the patient was discharged with complete disappearance of micturition symptoms.
