A 13-year-old female patient was admitted after suddenly presenting with generalised flushing with intense pruritus, diarrhoeal discharge and loss of consciousness for approximately 5 minutes. After administration of a dose of IM adrenaline, she recovered completely.

For approximately 2 years she has reported episodes of similar characteristics, albeit milder, and with increasingly less frequent episodes between them.

An allergy test was carried out between episodes, but no aetiology was found, and she was discharged with treatment recommendations.

History of a trip to Rio de Janeiro prior to the onset of the episodes.
During admission she remained asymptomatic, with normal physical examination.

Initial complementary tests: CBC (haemogram, biochemistry, coagulation study, complement study, immunoglubilins, thyroid study, ANCAS and ANAS): anodine. Urine sediment: normal. Fundus examination: normal. Stool culture, stool parasites negative. HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, mycoplasma, RPR negative.

Following these results, the study was extended to make a differential diagnosis of CSU vs. carcinoid syndrome.

Secondary complementary tests: ACTH, cortisol and insulin were normal. 5 HIA, vanillylmandelic and homovanillic in 24-hour urine: normal. ECG, EEG, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound and echocardiogram: normal. Echinococcus serology: negative. Serology Giardia Lamblia (G.L): IgM positive, IgG positive.

Treatment with Metronidazole for 7 days. One month later she presented a new episode of facial redness and pruritus, which resolved spontaneously. Given the possibility of resistance to metronidazole, treatment with tinidazole was prescribed. Since then she has been asymptomatic with negative IgM to G. L.
