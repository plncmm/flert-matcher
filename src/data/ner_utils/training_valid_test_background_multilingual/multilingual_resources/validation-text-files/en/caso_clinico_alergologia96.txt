Three-year-old patient who, after eating cured goat's and sheep's cheese, presented with oral pruritus and facial wheals. Occasionally, after ingesting cow's milk and cheese, stridor and dysphonia appear. He also had symptoms after eating other foods containing milk proteins (corn snacks, sausages).
Serum specific IgE was quantified for cow's milk casein (3.60 kU/L), and for goat's milk (42.3 kU/L) and sheep's milk (51.7 kU/L). Prick-prick positive with goat (10x6 mm) and sheep (11x6 mm) cheese, and negative for cow's milk. SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting: IgE binding more intense in goat and sheep milk extracts than in cow milk (in bands in probable correspondence with caseins). Immunoblotting-inhibition: sheep and goat milk extracts are able to completely inhibit IgE binding on cow milk extract.

Conclusions:
Comments. This is a case of primary sensitisation to goat and sheep milk. The patient tolerates cow's milk due to its regular consumption, but occasionally has reactions, due to the existence of significant cross-reactivity with proteins from goat's and sheep's milk.
