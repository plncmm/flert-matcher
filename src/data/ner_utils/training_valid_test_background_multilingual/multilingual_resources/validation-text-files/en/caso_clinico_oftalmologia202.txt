A 38-year-old heterosexual male patient, immunocompetent, who came to our hospital six months after being diagnosed in another centre with macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion in his left eye (OI). At that centre he had received an injection of transseptal triamcinolone with significant improvement in his macular oedema, which recurred shortly afterwards. His visual acuity (VA) was 0.4 and he had cystic macular oedema (CMO) in the left eye. The examination of the right eye was normal. The study of thromboembolic risk factors and hypercoagulability was normal, with the exception of lupus anticoagulant, which was at borderline values. Intravitreal treatment with aflibercept was proposed and, after loading doses (three monthly injections), no functional or anatomical improvement was obtained. The patient discontinued treatment, but returned a year later with worsening vision. He presented with a VA of 0.1 in his OI and increased retinal thickening. The rest of the examination was normal. Given the previous failure of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), intravitreal dexamethasone implantation was performed. Six weeks after implantation, the patient had a VA of 0.5 in his OI and normal retinal thickness with normal ocular tensions.
Ten weeks after implantation, the patient came to the emergency department with redness and pain in the LAA. He reported a nasal cold that had been present for a week. He presented with VA of hand movement, a significant inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber (cells and flare 3+), pupillary synechiae, vitreous turbidity and whitish-greyish plaques in the upper retina in the mid-periphery with scarce haemorrhages. Examination of the OD was normal. The patient was admitted and an aqueous humour puncture was performed for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis of the herpes family and culture. Serology was requested for herpes simplex, herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr, HIV, toxoplasmosis and lues. A differential diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis versus endophthalmitis was made and intravenous treatment with acyclovir was started and continued for seven days. The aqueous humour sample was negative for herpes virus and culture negative (reported as contaminated by Streptococcus mitis). Blood serology for syphilis was positive (VDRL+ [Venereal Disease Research Laboratory], treponemal tests: IgG and IgM+). All other serologies were negative. Lumbar puncture was performed: cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal and VDRL serology was negative. The dermatological examination revealed an erythematous and infiltrated lesion in the groin of three weeks' duration: "doubtful primary chancroid".
On the third day of admission, intravenous treatment with crystalline penicillin G was started, with a daily dose of 21 million units intravenously at a frequency of 3.5 million units every 4 hours for 14 days, and progressive healing of the retinitis areas was observed, although VA did not improve. Multiple vitreous opacities and tractions developed, which it was decided to treat by vitrectomy. The dexamethasone implant was visible in the inferior periphery. The vitrectomy had to be delayed for ten days due to the development of phlebitis in his left arm secondary to intravenous penicillin infusion. During vitrectomy the upper retina was detached and rigid. Vitreous culture was negative. Despite vitrectomy with silicone injection, complete retinal reapplication was not achieved and the final VA was light perception. The patient has been followed up for one year and is stable.
