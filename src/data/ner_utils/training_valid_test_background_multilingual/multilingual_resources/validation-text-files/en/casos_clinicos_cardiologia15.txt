A 55-year-old man with mitral and aortic biological valve prostheses (Bioimplant) since 1989. He was admitted in May 1996 for back pain, fever and general malaise of 4 weeks' duration, with clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. Physical examination revealed fever of 38°C, apical impulse displaced laterally and inferiorly towards the anterior axillary line, rhythmic heart sounds of normal intensity with aortic systolic ejection murmur grade II/VI and mild splenomegaly. The admission blood test showed a white blood cell count of 11,300/μl (91% neutrophils) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 12 mm at one hour. The rest of the analytical parameters were within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 70 beats/min, PR spacing 0.16. QRS axis at +60° and non-specific ventricular repolarisation disturbance from V4 to V6. Chest X-ray showed radiological grade I cardiomegaly with cardiothoracic index of 0.55. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mitral prosthetic valve dysfunction with prolapse of one of its leaflets and mild-moderate regurgitation; aortic prosthetic valve dysfunction with mild prolapse and regurgitation; there was no definite evidence of endocardial vegetation. Six serial blood cultures were performed, and Staphylococcus capitis growth was detected in all of them. Specific antibiotic therapy was started, according to the antibiogram and in accordance with the therapeutic regimen recommended in the literature with vancomycin (30 mg/kg body weight i.v. every 24 h in four daily doses), rifampicin (300 mg v.o. every 8 h) both for six weeks and gentamicin (1 mg/kg body weight i.v. every 8 h) for two weeks 7 , with fever remitting on the third day of treatment. Six days after admission, the patient suffered a fleeting episode of dizziness, dysarthria, paraesthesia in the left hand, headache and generalised tremor. Cranial CT scan showed an image of cerebral infarction in the right temporoparietal region. Transesophageal echocardiography showed aortic and mitral valve vegetations, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation. Fifteen days after admission, the patient presented pain in the left hypochondrium and increased splenomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound and gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed the existence of a splenic infarction. Twenty-one days after admission, fever recurred, and a new blood test showed an elevated ESR up to 84 mm in the first hour and anaemia not present on admission with a haemoglobin of 9.8 mg/dl and a haematocrit of 28.7%. Given the patient's clinical evolution, surgery was decided, and the biological valve prostheses were replaced twice with new mechanical valve prostheses on day 30 of admission. The same antibiotherapy treatment regimen was continued for a further two weeks. Subsequent blood cultures showed no growth of microorganisms. The patient's clinical evolution was favourable and he was discharged from hospital 57 days after admission. It was not possible to identify the entry point of the germ.
