A 50-year-old woman, with no known history of illness or drug use, was hospitalised in our centre with fever, chills and dry cough. On admission, blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 37.2°C and oxygen saturation (in room air) 95%. Initial examination revealed no abnormalities. Initial ECG showed no abnormal findings. Due to lung involvement on chest CT, the patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and heparin as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, at standard doses. No electrolyte disturbances were observed during hospitalisation. On the fifth day of hospitalisation, the physician decided to discharge the patient and continue treatment at home. During discharge, the patient suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and died after ineffective resuscitation.
