Anamnesis
An 11-year-old girl with no known drug allergies or personal medical or surgical history of interest came for consultation in September 2013 due to the progressive appearance of lesions on the dorsum of both hands over a 6-month period, which did not disappear. The lesions were not painful or pruritic, although they were sometimes "annoying". His paediatrician had prescribed treatment with fusidic acid ointment for 3 days without improvement and oral antibiotics. No contact with animals. She does not have a fish tank and has not been in rivers. Right-handed patient.

Physical examination
On the back of both hands and left forearm, papules 0.7-1 cm in diameter, lichenified and hypopigmented surface with surface erosion. Lesions mainly on the left hand and on the right hand a single lesion of the same characteristics, although less raised. Not indurated on palpation. No other associated lesions.

Complementary examinations
- Bacterial culture: positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus mitis.
- Fungal culture: negative.
- Mycobacterial culture: negative.
- Biopsy: orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and superficial ulceration, in papillary dermis vascular proliferation with dilated capillaries. No foreign material was observed. PAS and Ziehl-Nielsen stains showed no fungi or acid fast bacilli.

Diagnosis
Dermatitis artefacta.

Evolution and treatment
The first diagnostic impression after assessing the patient was that the lesions were self-induced by excoriation with her own nails or another object. At the first consultation a culture for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria was performed.
Mupirocin ointment 1 application/12 hours for 15 days was prescribed and the patient was assessed again. After seeing that there was no improvement, and her relatives demanded a diagnosis, we treated with Betamethasone and Gentamicin cream plus bandage 1 application/12 hours for 15 days and oral antibiotic therapy.
The patient and her relatives were asked in separate interviews whether the lesions could be self-inflicted and the patient's school, family, psychological and social situation, denying at all times the self-infliction of the lesions and pointing out the patient's normality in all aspects of her life. The patient came to the consultation without the bandage and with the lesions in the same state, a biopsy of one of the lesions was proposed.
An occlusive dressing of both hands and forearms, excluding fingers, was definitely chosen and the patient was advised that the dressing would only be removed on the ward in 10 days. Improvement was achieved and it was proposed to continue for a further 7 days. The rapid improvement of the lesions that had previously been refractory to other therapies together with the appearance of a new lesion at a previously unaffected site (dorsum of the third finger of the left hand) supported the diagnosis.
Psychiatry was consulted for an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach.
