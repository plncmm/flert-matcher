Fifteen patients sensitised to different allergens were selected: Pteronyssinus, Alternaria, Cat, Dog, Olive, Salsola and Gramineae. After signing an informed consent form, end-point skin tests were performed on them (in tenth dilutions of the mother extract). Skin tests are performed on each patient with the different dilutions of the mother extract provided by each laboratory: 1/100; 1/10, 1/1 and are compared with the results obtained with histamine and with the commercial extracts for skin tests in PRICK.
