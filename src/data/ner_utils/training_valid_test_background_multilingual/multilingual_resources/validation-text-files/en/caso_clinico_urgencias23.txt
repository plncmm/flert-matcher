A 56-year-old woman attended the emergency department for pain and induration of the right leg. Personal history: operated on for varicose veins 3 years ago with unaesthetic scar sequelae, for which she underwent filling with cross-linked polymer and hyaluronic acid gel. Current illness:
Pain in twin area and skin lesions with purulent drainage on right leg of 1 week's evolution.

Physical examination:
Normal vitals. Good general condition. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: Normal. Abdomen: Soft, non-painful. No visceromegaly or inguinal adenopathy. Lower limbs: Left: normal. Right: swelling on the back of the leg, with several ulcers with indurated and purplish rim, dark background and spontaneous purulent drainage. Pulses present. Hommans negative.

Complementary tests: normal haemogram, coagulation and biochemistry. CRP 1.44. HIV serology negative. Blood cultures: negative. Exudate culture: negative. Chest X-ray: normal. Ultrasound scan of the right lower limb: diffuse thickening of the subcutaneous cellular tissue with multiple collections of complicated fluid and multiple fistulous tracts to the skin. Lower limb MRI: Cystic collections in the subcutaneous cellular tissue that may be related to abscesses, with diffuse signal alteration and heterogeneous enhancement in post-contrast sequences.
 Evolution:
Admission to the internal medicine department for suspected complicated soft tissue infection. Given the surgical history, different diagnostic possibilities were considered, such as sporotrichosis or a reaction to foreign material. For this reason, a skin biopsy was performed and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, with improvement of the inflammatory signs. Pathological anatomy: Cicatricial dermal fibrosis and inflammatory reaction with gigantocellular component to foreign body of exogenous origin (oily substance).
 Diagnosis:
Granulomatous reaction to foreign body on right lower limb.
