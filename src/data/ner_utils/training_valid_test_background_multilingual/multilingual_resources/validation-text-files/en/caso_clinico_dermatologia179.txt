Anamnesis
A 20-year-old man with a personal history of atopic dermatitis since childhood treated with topical pimecrolimus. He came to the emergency department with a generalised pruritic rash of 5 days' evolution. In the last 24 hours the patient began to present with thermometric fever of up to 39o C and associated general malaise.

Physical examination and complementary tests
Examination revealed multiple umbilicated papulovesicles together with scabs and disseminated pustules, located over practically the entire body surface with a predominance on the flanks. Tzanck's cytodiagnosis and PCR for herpes simplex type 1 were positive.

Diagnosis and treatment
The diagnosis of herpetic eczema was established and in-hospital treatment was started with acyclovir 300 mg/8 h, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1g/8 h, dexchlorpheniramine 5mg/12 h and local dressings with zinc sulphate 1/1000 fomentation every 12 hours and fusidic acid. After 7 days the patient was discharged with great improvement of the lesions.
