Anamnesis
A 33-year-old man, with a history of spring allergy to various pollens and cutaneous myiasis after a trip to Senegal in 2000, consulted for pruritic skin lesions on the dorsum of both feet that started during a trip to Brazil, from where he had returned three weeks earlier. The patient had spent 15 days on holiday on the beach in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, located on the north-eastern coast of that country. During the last days of his stay, he began to notice "bites on the bones of his feet", followed by a very itchy rash, which had been increasing, drawing "trails" on the back of both feet. Prior to the consultation, she had applied mometasone cream, with no improvement of the lesions.

Physical examination
Elevated erythematous-decamative lesions on the distal dorsal area of both feet including the toes, which converge in the form of meandering paths; papulovesicles with scaly collarete and a phlyctena at the base of the first toe of the left foot were observed.

Diagnosis
Given the clinical appearance of the lesions and the epidemiological history, the diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans is made and treatment is initiated without further diagnostic tests.

Treatment
Treatment was decided with Albendazole 400 mg/12 h for three days, together with Dexchlorpheniramine 6 mg/ 12 hours.

Evolution
At the 3-day check-up, the patient reported great improvement of the lesions from the first day of treatment. The infestation resolved completely in 10 days, leaving no scarring.
