A 42-year-old woman with fever and dry cough of two days' duration presented to her general practitioner. She had a history of contact with another person with similar symptoms, but had no pre-existing problems. On physical examination, no abnormalities were found; her temperature was 38°C and all other vital signs were normal. Oxygen saturation was 98%. Laboratory and imaging tests were ordered. The tests revealed high lactate dehydrogenase (648 units/litre (U/L), normal: 140-280U/L), C-reactive protein (52 milligrams/litre (mg/L), normal: < 10mg/L), aspartate aminotransferase (59U/L, normal: 10-40U/L), thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia (leukocytes = 2600/microlitre, 31% lymphocytes). Serological tests for rheumatoid antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative, as well as antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus. Mild bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities were seen on lung CT. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the clinical findings, a nasopharyngeal swab test was performed and acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid was detected by RT-PCR. Treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours. After two days, the patient presented with a pruritic erythematous erythematous maculopapular rash and atypical rosette lesions starting on the distal end of the upper extremities and rapidly affecting the whole body, as well as torn blisters that were only visible as ulcers in the orolabial area. There was genital mucosal involvement, but the patient did not allow us to take images. Nikolski's sign was positive. Finally, Stevens-Johnson syndrome was diagnosed.
Because of the likelihood of a drug reaction, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and treatment for COVID-19 was changed to lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg twice daily in the hospital. Loratadine 10 mg twice daily and diphenhydramine 50 mg three times daily were also administered. The patient was discharged five days later with non-pruritic exfoliative dermatosis on the distal end of the upper extremities.
