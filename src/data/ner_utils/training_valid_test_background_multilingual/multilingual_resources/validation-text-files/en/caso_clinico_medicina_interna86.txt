Reason for consultation
A 42-year-old woman referred by her primary care physician for anaemia.

Personal history
No drug allergies, no cardiovascular risk factors, no toxic habits. Medical history: primary hypothyroidism; hiatus hernia; left retrobulbar optic neuritis (with total amaurosis in the left eye. Diagnosed one year ago. Suspicion of autoimmune neuromyelitis optica non filiata). Surgeries: cholecystectomy in 2008; tubal ligation. Baseline: Native of Peru. Current residence in Spain for 7 years. Last trip to Peru 4 years ago, no trips to other countries. Usual treatment: Prednisone: discontinued two months earlier. Azathioprine: 50 mg/8 hours (previously up to 2 months ago: 50 mg/day); Gabapentin: 600 mg/8 hours; Levothyroxine: 75 mcg/day.

Current illness
The patient consulted for asthenia and increased abdominal perimeter for 2 months. In addition, in the last few days, fever of 38o C, headache and pain in the right hemiabdomen. She provided a blood test carried out by her primary care doctor (1 month earlier) showing bicytopenia (Hb 9.4 g/dL, leukocytes 1,800, neutrophils 500, platelets 200,000/mm3). No contact with animals, taking NSAIDs or herbal products. No other symptoms in the anamnesis. The only relevant history was that she had been receiving treatment with corticoids and azathioprine 50 mg/day for a year. Three months ago, the patient consulted a private neurologist for a second opinion on the amaurosis, despite being clinically stable, who increased the dose of azathioprine to 150 mg/day and gradually discontinued the corticoids.

Physical examination
BP: 115/58 mm Hg, HR: 103 bpm, Ta: 38oC. Good general condition. Good cutaneous-mucosal colour. No cyanosis. No respiratory work. Head and neck: no alterations. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: no alterations. Abdomen: soft and depressible, giant hepatomegaly, medium consistency, slightly painful on palpation, without splenomegaly or abdominal masses; ascitic semiology in flanks; negative Murphy and Blumberg signs; no signs of peritoneal irritation, normal RHA. MMII: no alterations. Neurological: no meningeal signs, no other focality.

Complementary tests in the emergency department:
Blood tests: Hb 5.8 g/dL, Hto 16%, VCM 108.7, HCM 39.3, ADE 29.9 %, platelets 49,000/uL, leukocytes 2,200/uL (PMN 48 %), I.N.R. 1.14, fibrinogen 639 mg/dL, bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, CRP 6.6 mg/dL. The rest of the biochemistry was normal. Basic urinalysis: Bilirubin +, Urobilinogen >=8.0 mg/dL, rest normal; Chest X-ray: pinching of both costophrenic sinuses. Abdominal CT scan: patchy hypodensity suggesting hepatic fatty infiltration vs. liver disease; permeability of hepatic vascular structures; no LOEs identified; portal hypertension (repermeabilisation of paraumbilical veins); moderate amount of ascites.

Management
In the ED, the patient is assessed by haematology, who performs a peripheral blood smear, confirming pancytopenia, with no blasts or dysplastic features. She received a transfusion of 3 red blood cell concentrates, which were well tolerated. In addition, given the finding of fever and abdominal pain (in the context of immunosuppression), an urgent abdominal CT scan was requested. An unsuccessful diagnostic paracentesis was attempted. After drawing blood cultures, urine culture and stool culture, empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem was started and the patient was admitted to the ward. Given the febrile neutropenia in an immunosuppressed patient, azathioprine was discontinued.

Admission to the ward
Presenting the following problems: 1) Hepatopathy with portal hypertension and subacute ascites (with pleural effusion), to be studied; 2) Febrile syndrome, in immunosuppressed patient, to be studied; 3) Recent onset pancytopenia, to be studied; 4) Optic neuritis OI with amaurosis.

Initial clinical course
She presented fever for the first 2 days, empirical treatment with meropenem was started, after which she remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable (tendency to hypo-AT). He presented with painful hepatomegaly and ascites requiring evacuation paracentesis on 2 occasions. In the analytical controls in the first 48 hours of admission, the platelet count decreased to 25,000/uL and leukocytes to 1,200/uL with 300 segmented, and Hb 9: g/dL. There was hypoproteinaemia of 5.4 g/dL, decreased haptoglobin levels (<10 mg/dL), elevated reticulocytes (4.5-5%), LDH 746 U/L, negative Coombs D and I, mild hypertransaminasemia with bilirubin 3 mg/dL and mild alteration of haemostasis compatible with liver disease. Reverse isolation was performed, and treatment was started with filgrastim, red blood cell concentrate, meropenem and treatment aimed at controlling ascites with IV furosemide, IV albumin and oral spironolactone. Study of ascites (febrile syndrome and subacute ascites): Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, with data compatible with transudate (200 leukocytes/uL, 1. 000 erythrocytes, glucose 107, prot 2.4 g/dL, alb <2g/dL (plasma: 3.6 d/dL albumin), LDH 100 u/L, alpha-amylase 25 u/L Ã  serum albumin/ascitic albumin gradient > 1.1) compatible with portal hypertension (PHT). Negative microbiology, negative cytology and normal immunophenotype in ascitic fluid. Blood tests were negative for hepatotropic viruses, EBV, CMV, HIV and TB. Leishmania positive (the patient had a positive serological history in a blood test a year earlier). Negative tumour markers (AFP, CA-125, CEA, CA-15-3, CA-19-9, CYFRA 21-1, B-hCG B-2-m). Negative autoimmune hepatitis study. Normal echocardiogram. On presenting with fever, infectious causes were ruled out first (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and secondary peritonitis were ruled out, as well as infectious causes of liver disease) and the primary tumoural cause of the peritoneum, in addition to others (alcoholic liver disease, as there was no known consumption; cirrhosis; autoimmune hepatitis; cardiac ascites, as there were no clinical manifestations of heart failure and the echocardiogram was normal; fatty liver of pregnancy). The most probable cause of the ascites was PTH, the cause of the PTH being unclear, as the CT scan performed in the ED showed no hepatic LOEs or thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins or portal vein. Study of portal hypertension: A study of coagulation disorders was performed, as thrombosis of the hepatic venous system in a patient with no previous liver disease is a cause of subacute ascites. The study of thrombophilias and antiphospholipid syndromes was performed. Antiphospholipid syndrome was normal. Hepatic Doppler ultrasound: moderately enlarged liver without focal lesions; intraperitoneal free fluid; portal and suprahepatic veins permeable; portal hypertension (repermeabilisation of paraumbilical veins). Hepatic angio-MRI: liver with heterogeneous patchy signal; no ascitic fluid; signs of PAH (repermeabilisation of paraumbilical vein and oesophageal varices); splenomegaly. There are presinusoidal and post-sinusoidal causes of PHT. Imaging tests ruled out presinusoidal causes such as portal thrombosis, extrinsic compression of the portal vein, diffuse hepatic infiltration by tumours or inflammatory diseases, and post-sinusoidal causes such as thrombosis of suprahepatic veins or extrinsic compression, as well as liver cirrhosis. A final diagnostic test was performed: transjugular biopsy and hepatic haemodynamic study as a study of non-filial PHT. The study of pancytopenia was focused on ruling out different aetiologies: deficiency, pharmacological toxicity, haemolysis, hypersplenism, infectious causes and central origin. The tests performed were: haemogram: pancytopenia with regenerative anaemia, high MCV, morphological smear without blasts, dysplasia or schistocytes (ruling out DIC, PTT), high LDH and low haptoglobin, Coombs D and I negative. Vitamins and iron met. Iron were normal, ruling out deficiencies. Up to this point the patient presented with pancytopenia with non-immune intravascular haemolytic anaemia and severe neutropenia with no neutrophil response. Initially, no splenomegaly was found, but in her evolution she did present splenomegaly, a consequence of the PHT, with possible hypersplenism among other mechanisms. Infectious and blood parasite serologies were negative, except for Leishmaniasis, which will be discussed briefly below. The autoimmunity and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Paroxysmal Haemoglobinuria studies were negative, peripheral blood immunophenotypes were normal and the immunoglobulin study was normal. All this did not yet allow us to rule out: central or peripheral pharmacological toxicity, primary haematological disease, myeloptysis or visceral leishmaniasis, so a bone marrow (BM) biopsy was necessary. Leishmaniasis was ruled out: the patient presented with pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, ascites and later also splenomegaly. She was a native of Peru and had been living in Spain for 7 years, endemic areas of Leishmania donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar, whose clinical manifestations include sudden fever with shivering and chills, as well as hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests show cytopenias and hypertransaminasemia, as our patient presented during her evolution. Diagnosis is made by identifying amastigotes in smears of aspirated tissue (spleen, bone marrow or lymph nodes). In our patient, Leishmania serology (IFA) detected antibodies at a titre: 1/160 (significant titre). In a sample from a year earlier the titre was similar, making leishmaniasis less likely to be the cause of the disease. Finally, an OM biopsy was performed. Giemsa staining and culture of both blood and OM showed no amastigotes.

Definitive diagnostic tests
- Splanchnic haemodynamic study: suprahepatic wedge pressure: 19.5 mm Hg, suprahepatic free pressure: 9 mm Hg, hepatic venous pressure gradient: 10.5 mm Hg. Subsequent venography without findings. Samples were taken for biopsy. Conclusion: clinically significant sinusoidal portal hypertension.
-Transjugular liver biopsy: vascular changes with nodular regenerative hyperplasia, venous sinusoidal dilatation and foci of ischaemic necrosis, suggesting an alteration in the blood supply of the organ with accompanying venous sinusoidal hypertension. Mild acinar inflammatory changes that do not allow us to rule out a pharmacological origin. Transjugular liver biopsy: Sinusoidal vascular congestion, focal inflammatory infiltrates located both within the acini and in the portal spaces.
- BM biopsy: normocellular medullary parenchyma (3/5). Erythroid and histiocytic hyperplasia and CD8+ interstitial lymphocytosis at the time of sampling. A cytotoxic mechanism for cytopenias with/without haemophagocytosis is not ruled out.

Final clinical course
The patient remained in hospital for 4 weeks. Supportive treatment and antibiotic therapy were carried out. In the last week she showed significant clinical improvement with a significant decrease in hepatomegaly (two crossings and non-painful) and ascites. At the same time, the analytical values gradually improved, with the last control: Hb 11 g/dL, MCV 107, RDW 22.6%, Ret 4.58%, platelets 93,000/uL, leukocytes 4,900/uL (2. 600 neutrophils), ESR 86 mm, INR 1, ALT 50 U/L, AST 59, Bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL, GGT 156, FAL 158, LDH 467, Creatinine 0.62 mg/dL, Sodium 138 mmol/L, Potassium 3.9 mm/L, Protein 8 g/dL.

Clinical judgement at discharge
- Resolved severe bicytopenia, secondary to bone marrow toxicity due to azathioprine.
- Non-immune haemolytic anaemia, resolving. Probable toxicity due to azathioprine, without being able to identify other causes.
- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) of subacute evolution, secondary to azathioprine toxicity.
- Febrile syndrome in an immunosuppressed patient, without clear infectious focus, resolved.
- OI optic neuritis of autoimmune aetiology. Suspicion of autoimmune neuromyelitis optica.
