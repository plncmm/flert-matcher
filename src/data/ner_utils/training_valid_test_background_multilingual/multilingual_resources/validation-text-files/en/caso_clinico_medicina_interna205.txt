A 79-year-old woman with a history of osteonecrosis of the right thorax post-radiotherapy for breast carcinoma 20 years ago. She was admitted with fever, dyspnoea, chest wall fistula, right pleural effusion, slight leukocytosis with neutrophilia and marked elevation of CRP (245 mg/L) and Procalcitonin (19.33 ng/mL). A chest CT scan showed massive pleural effusion and signs of osteonecrosis in the 3rd to 5th right costal arches with wall involvement. Pleural drainage resulted in empyema with pure isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, also cultured in exudate from the external fistula. Cytology of the exudate showed no malignancy. She was diagnosed with sepsis and Bacteroides fragilis infection of the chest wall including osteomyelitis with contiguity to pleural cavity and empyema. She received Metronidazole and Imipenem iv with progressive improvement, however 9 days later she presented with a coma crisis coinciding with hyponatraemia of 113 mEq/L, in a situation of euvolemia and data compatible with SIADH (Furst index 0.84). Imipenem was withdrawn due to its comicial potential, Metronidazole was maintained and Tolvaptan 15 mg/day was added, with correction of natraemia. Seven months later she remains afebrile and paucisymptomatic with oral Metronidazole and the need for Tolvaptan due to persistent hyponatraemia.
