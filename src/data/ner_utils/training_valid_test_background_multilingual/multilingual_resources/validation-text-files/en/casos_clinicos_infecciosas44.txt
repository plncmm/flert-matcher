A 55 year old woman was brought to the emergency department by her brother because in the last 3 weeks they had noticed strange behaviour in the patient. Among the behavioural alterations, her brother reported: episodes of verbal aggression, neglect of personal hygiene and of her home, time lapses in which she was absent from her home for several hours without being able to be contacted, among others. The patient was a native of AlmerÃ­a, who had been living in Granada for 15 years. An administrative worker, she had been in early retirement for three years. Her medical history did not include any personal or family history of interest, which was also not acknowledged by her companion. She was taking fluoxetine daily (prescribed by her primary care doctor for depressive mood). In the direct anamnesis, the patient expressed fear for the possibility that she and her parents were suffering from a "tumour in the head" (for which reason she had already sought medical attention on several occasions in different emergency departments in recent weeks). As a physical fact of interest, her relatives had detected a weight loss of 10 kg, which they related to a reduction in her intake, which the patient considered necessary, as she was convinced that she was going to undergo a surgical procedure. On initial physical examination she was afebrile, all other vital signs were good, except for a slight tendency to tachycardia. She was markedly thin but there were no other noteworthy findings in the rest of the physical examination.

Initial complementary tests
- ECG: sinus tachycardia at 118 bpm, axis at 60o, normal conduction, no acute repolarisation abnormalities.
- Urgent laboratory tests: basal glycaemia, renal function and electrolytes without alterations. C-reactive protein (CRP) 63.57 mg/l. LDH 558.6 U/ml. The haemogram shows normocytic anaemia, normochromic with haemoglobin figures at 8.2 g/l. 8300 leukocytes/mm3 with lymphopenia (lymphocytes 11.3%), normal platelets. Basic coagulation with INR 1.48 and prothrombin activity of 55.7%.

After initial assessment, it was decided to admit the patient to Psychiatry to complete the study of the initial psychotic picture. 48 hours after admission, the on-call Internal Medicine department was called to assess the patient for fever and deterioration of her level of consciousness. The patient was febrile (38.5o) and with a low level of consciousness, semi-comatose with little response to painful stimuli and no response to verbal stimuli, so it was decided to perform an urgent cranial CT scan and subsequent lumbar puncture. The cranial CT scan only showed diffuse cortical atrophic changes, ruling out lesions that produced a mass effect or bleeding, so a lumbar puncture was performed and CSF was obtained with a clear appearance and an outflow pressure of 14 cm H2O. The biochemical analysis showed glucose 69 mg/dl (serum glucose 114 mg/dl) and protein 40.7 g/L. Cytology reported the presence of 0 leukocytes/mm3 and 1 haemocyte/mm3 and the absence of microorganisms in the Gram stain.

Given the severity of the clinical picture, and despite the normal CSF analysis, it was decided to start treatment with Acyclovir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/8h due to the possibility of herpetic encephalitis. CSF Herpesvirus PCR, CSF enterovirus PCR, MRI and complete blood tests with general biochemistry, acute phase reactants, serology, ferrokinetics and autoimmunity were requested, and the diagnosis was reached.

Differential diagnosis
All those mental disorders in which the patient loses the correct judgement of reality at some point are traditionally recognised as psychotic disorders. This group includes such diverse illnesses as dementia, delirium (organic or symptomatic psychosis), substance-induced psychotic disorders (toxic psychosis), schizophrenia, paranoia and manic-depressive psychosis. In order to make a better diagnostic classification, ICD-10 has restricted the term, and acute psychosis is now considered to be "a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by the acute onset of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations and perceptual disturbances, and by a severe disturbance of the patient's usual behaviour. It is necessary for the diagnosis to have ruled out the existence of an organic cause". Therefore, the diagnosis itself is exclusive and requires a screening for underlying organic pathology. It should not be forgotten that, in atypical presentations (such as those with altered level of consciousness, memory deficit or late onset), the possibility of a psychotic disorder secondary to general medical pathology or induced by substances should be considered as the first cause, it being important to exclude diseases of acute and severe course at the first moment of the patient's care.

There is no doubt that the case in question could be classified as a late-onset case: this is a 55-year-old woman with no evidence of previous psychiatric pathology. However, there are other data that make the application of the term "psychosis" to the clinical picture imprecise, such as: the low level of consciousness with which we found the patient and the existence of fever. It is above all this first factor, the reduced level of consciousness, which is crucial for confirming the existence of delirium or acute confusional syndrome, an expression more appropriate to current medical terminology, if we take into account the definition given in the latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases, which marks the orientation of our differential diagnosis.

Acute confusional syndrome is often associated with psychotic symptoms and its clinical manifestations can fluctuate in intensity, usually presenting suddenly. It should be remembered that it is a potentially reversible disorder, without forgetting that there are certain aetiologies that can cause permanent damage to the central nervous system if left unresolved. There are a multitude of different causes capable of producing it: endocrinological, metabolic, secondary to the consumption of drugs and medicines, infectious, structural involvement of the CNS.

Evolution
The day after the first assessment, the results of PCR tests for herpesvirus and enterovirus in CSF were negative, so treatment with Acyclovir was suspended. After the initial results of the blood biochemistry, the existence of metabolic alterations was ruled out (renal and hepatic functions were preserved and there were no hydroelectrolytic alterations or signs of malnutrition). In the hormonal study, thyroid function was normal, and autoantibodies (ANA, ENA and ANCAs) were negative. The haemogram showed persistent normochromic normochromic anaemia, detected at the start, which remained stable, associated on this occasion with leukopenia (2770 leukocytes/mm3) with lymphopenia (430/mm3). She also had an ESR>140 mm/h.

The patient was single, with several occasional sexual partners. It was not known whether she used protective measures during sexual intercourse. She acknowledged social alcohol consumption; her relatives denied any knowledge of other substance use. Cranial MRI with contrast did not detect space-occupying lesions or vascular or myelination alterations suggestive of structural neurological pathology.

Several days later, serology results were positive for HIV-1. An immunovirological study was then performed, which showed a total CD4 count of 30 cells/mm3 (7%) and a serum viral load of 1,062,917 copies/ml. The CSF viral load was 11,260 copies/ml. These complementary tests revealed the existence of advanced HIV infection, with severe immunosuppression and high viral load in both blood and CNS. Antiretroviral therapy was started, after ruling out the existence of tuberculosis infection with a negative IGRA test, with tenofovir, emtricitabine and cobicistat/elvitegravir, with good tolerance. During her admission, the patient continued with behavioural alterations and required follow-up by psychiatry, who started antipsychotic treatment with haloperidol. There was a progressive cognitive-behavioural improvement, although at discharge, one month after admission, there was still some temporal and personal disorientation. The patient was reviewed after discharge in outpatient clinics, 2 months after starting antiretroviral treatment, and was found to be asymptomatic from the neuropsychiatric point of view and with almost total recovery of weight and usual daily activity.

Final diagnosis
The final diagnosis was acute confusional syndrome secondary to HIV encephalopathy in a woman with late-onset HIV infection, with AIDS criteria (Stage C3).
