A 46-year-old woman with no medical history was seen at the clinic for a febrile syndrome that had been present for five months. The fever was daily, predominantly in the evening and was accompanied by night sweats. She had no other clinical manifestations. Examination showed only laterocervical, supraclavicular lymphadenopathies, mobile and soft in consistency.
Initial examinations showed only iron-deficiency microcytic anaemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dL, MCV 72.7 fL, ferritin 97 ng/mL), and elevated CRP (16.5 mg/dL). Chest X-ray was normal.
In cases of prolonged monosymptomatic fever, infectious causes such as tuberculosis, subacute endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscesses and leishmania should be considered. Any autoimmune disease can present with fever, with sarcoidosis and polymyalgia being the most common. Lymphoma, hepatocarcinoma and clear cell cancer are the most common malignancies to debut with fever.
The expanded study focused on fever and microcytic anaemia and included smear microscopy, serology (HCV, HBV, HIV), antitranglutaminase, abdominal ultrasound, transthoracic echocardiogram, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, which were normal or negative. The proteinogram showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
To complete the study of the fever of unknown origin, a PET-CT scan with F18-FDG was performed, which showed diffuse metabolic hyperactivity in the bone marrow and at the left supraclavicular level. Based on these findings, a bone marrow biopsy was requested with negative immunophenotyping and microbiological studies for leishmania and tuberculosis. A left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was performed and reported sclerosing lymphadenitis with polyclonal plasmacytosis and vascular proliferation compatible with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease. PCR for HIV and HHV-8 on the surgical specimen was negative. IL-6 was 650. Treatment with tocelizumab (monoclonal IL-6 receptor blocker) was started, with clinical improvement, regression of adenopathies and decrease of IL-6 (fundamental in the pathogenesis of this disease).
