Personal history
Thirty-year-old man from Cádiz, smoker of twenty cigarettes a day, without criteria of chronic bronchitis and social drinker. He went on a 40-day backpacking trip with his partner in north-west Africa, visiting both rural and urban areas: Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Mali and Equatorial Guinea. He received travel advice at the International Health Centre, with well complimented chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine. She received tetravalent meningococcal, yellow fever and oral typhoid vaccinations. She reported no specific risk behaviours during the trip except for bathing in fresh water in Bamako.

Present illness
Twenty-four hours after his return, he presented to the Emergency Department with high fever, chills, catarrhal symptoms and holocranial headache. After initial basic assessment and with no apparent outbreak, he was discharged with treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
He consulted again 24 hours later due to persistent febrile symptoms, holocranial headache, profuse sweating, rhinoconjunctivitis and non-productive cough.  Physical examination The patient had blood pressure 100/60; heart rate 110 bpm; temperature 37.8oC; baseline O2 saturation 98%; Glasgow score 15/15. He was conscious and oriented, eupneic and well perfused, with small, elastic laterocervical lymphadenopathies and no painful craniofacial stitches. Cardiopulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal. The skin showed a discrete erythematous macular rash on the trunk and neck, without petechial lesions (including tourniquet test). The neurological examination showed no meningeal signs or focality.

Complementary examinations
The haemogram showed a normal red blood count, leukocytes of 3,360/μL with relative neutrophilia, platelets of 58,000/μL. Coagulation times were: prothrombin time 76%; normal activated partial thromboplastin time; fibrinogen 450 mg/dL. Biochemistry showed normal levels of glucose, ions, CPK, urea and creatinine. GOT/GPT 140/176 U/L; LDH 691 U/L; CRP 12.24 mg/dL. Venous blood gas analysis showed pH 7.41; pCO2 34 mmHg; HCO3 16 mEq/dL. Urine sediment showed signs of proteinuria. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The thick blood smear and peripheral blood smear were negative, as were serial blood cultures. Serology for hepatitis A, B and C viruses, Coxiella, Borrellia, Rickettsia, dengue and HIV was negative.

Diagnostic test
Plasmodium falciparum was observed in the second thick blood smear (eight hours after the first, at the height of the fever), with a parasitism index of 1%.

Clinical judgement
Severe malaria complicated by Plasmodium falciparum.

Evolution
Initial empirical antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone 2 g/24 h and doxycycline 100 mg/12 h was performed. Once Plasmodium falciparum infection was confirmed, the start of specific treatment with quinine was delayed by 29 hours for the oral route and 48 hours for the intravenous route due to lack of stock at our hospital and all the hospitals in the region (Cádiz, Jerez, Algeciras and Sanlúcar). Once the drug was obtained, treatment was started first orally and then intravenously with a slow infusion of quinine (10 mg/kg/8 hours) plus doxycycline 100 mg/12 hours orally, completing seven days of treatment. During the first 36 hours on the ward, he had a poor clinical evolution, with the development of successive complications that required admission to the ICU on the second day:
- Refractory hypoglycaemia despite administration of 20% glucose solution.
- Parasitisation of 12% on the third-fourth day, which, together with the rest of the complications, made it necessary to consider an exchange transfusion.
- Early analytical data of acute liver failure: prothrombin time 45%; bilirubin up to 6 mg/dL; GOT/GPT with figures of around 1200 U/L and decreased Factor V.
- Severe anaemia (haematocrit <20% at 72 h), requiring transfusion of four packed red cells.
- Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.31; HCO3 11), requiring aggressive management with fluid therapy under central venous pressure control, without requiring vasoactive drugs.
- Cognitive impairment with somnolence and ideomotor slowness, with no other signs of cerebral malaria, from the second to the fifth day.
- Acute renal failure, with peak creatinine on the fifth day of 5.2 mg/dL, with documented haemoglobinuria. He maintained acceptable diuresis throughout and did not require renal replacement therapy.
- Incoercible nausea and vomiting requiring enteral nutrition for the first four days.
- Interstitial infiltrate in the right upper lobe (although without evidence of respiratory failure, so late development of respiratory distress was ruled out) and febrile rebound around the fifth day, with radiological resolution after empirical antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin 200 mg/12 h intravenous.

After seven days in the ICU, treatment ended with general clinical recovery, presenting renal failure at discharge, with creatinine levels of around 3 mg/dL (MDRD 20 mL/min). Subsequent outpatient follow-up, renal function has normalised.
