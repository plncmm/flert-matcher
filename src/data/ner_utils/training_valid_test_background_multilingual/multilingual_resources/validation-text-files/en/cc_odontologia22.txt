50 YEAR OLD MALE PATIENT who comes to the periodontist sent by his family. He has never been to the dentist. His main reason for consulting is: to put an end to the chaos in my mouth that I have not attended to out of fear and now I have general discomfort in my whole mouth and mobility in my teeth.

As for his medical history, he is an ASA I type patient, non-smoker. In this case we will apply the decision tree for the classification of periodontitis by stages and grades. New patient who underwent a complete radiographic study, comprehensive extraoral and intraoral examination and recording of periodontal parameters.

In the extraoral examination we only found an anomaly in the breathing habit, which is fundamentally oral. The intraoral examination revealed a congenital interincisive diastema and a narrow band of keratinised tissue in the #43 buccal area. In addition, there is a large amount of bacterial deposits and an appearance of the gingival margin with significant changes in size, shape, texture and colouration. The gums appear enlarged, oedematous, shiny and purplish in colour.

In the periapical radiographic examination there is clearly detectable bone loss (PO). The complete periodontal study also shows clinical attachment loss (ICL), recession, high probing depth and a high rate of bleeding. With these diagnostic tests we can suspect that the patient has periodontitis and we can continue with the clinical decision-making tree for the classification of stages and grades.

As an additional diagnostic test, a breath quality measurement was performed using Oral-ChromaÂ®, recording high values of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) in the sample, both hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), which are present in the metabolism of certain proteins and in bacterial waste material.

In 2016, this patient was diagnosed with the 1999 classification as generalised advanced chronic periodontitis, generalised recessions, furcation lesions, generalised mobility, severe objective halitosis, caries in distal #26 and congenital diastemas due to agenesis.

In the case of the current classification we would follow step 2, and by means of the records taken we confirm that it is periodontitis since there is bone loss (PO), loss of clinical attachment (PIC), bleeding on probing and furcation lesions, which leaves us in step 3a. This step takes into account the extent of the disease, so that if periodontitis affects more than 30% of the teeth it is considered generalised. Once the extent is established, we move to step 3b to classify the stage, starting with severity. This patient has ICP > 5 mm and radiographic PO > middle 1/3 of the roots, therefore, he is a patient with stage III or IV periodontitis.

We are in the step to establish the stage according to complexity and in our case the patient presents PS > 6 mm, tooth migration with mesialisation and flaring of the teeth in the edentulous sections, grade I to II mobility, class II furcation lesions and bone ridge defect, so our patient presents generalised stage IV periodontitis.

Once the patient's stage has been classified, the grade is estimated with the progression of the disease, which, if there are no previous records, is established by means of a ratio between bone loss and the patient's age, as well as taking into account risk factors. In this particular case, the patient would be classified as having generalised periodontitis stage IV grade C.

The patient received basic periodontal treatment consisting of oral hygiene instructions and motivational techniques and scaling and root planing.
