38-year-old male, Bulgarian, with risky sexual relations. He was admitted for progressive dyspnoea, non-productive cough and constitutional symptoms of two months' duration. On arrival there was a bilateral interstitial infiltrate on X-ray, no leukocytosis, positive serology for HIV with CD4 15 (1.7%) and viral load 5.77 log, Mantoux <5mm, negative Gamma IFN. Induced sputum was performed with positive immunofluorescence for Pneumocystis jirovecii and in which BAAR were not observed. A plasma CMV viraemia of 650 IUI/ml was detected. Given the suspicion of respiratory infection by Pneumocystis and CMV viraemia, the patient was treated for 21 days with cotrimoxazole iv, ganciclovir iv and corticotherapy, with resolution of the respiratory symptoms and radiological normalisation. On day +14 of starting cotrimoxazole, she started ART with TriumeqÂ®.
Twenty-four hours after sequencing to prophylactic oral cotrimoxazole, while still on treatment with ganciclovir iv, she began with high fever and desaturation. A new massive interstitial infiltrate was seen on X-ray, with no elevation of acute phase reactants. The differential diagnosis was inflammatory syndrome of immune reconstitution, vs. recurrence of Pneumocystis pneumonia, vs. pulmonary involvement by CMV, vs. other aetiology. Bronchoscopy was performed with negative results for tuberculosis. In BAS, positive immunofluorescence was detected for Pneumocystis and CMV PCR: 4860UI/ml. Ganciclovir iv was continued and a new 21-day course of cotrimoxazole iv and corticotherapy was performed, with resolution of the symptoms and discharge from hospital.
Subsequent follow-up in consultations with progressive improvement of her immunovirological status with ART. At month +7: CD4 126 (7.9%), viral load undetectable. Eleven months after the initial admission, he presented with a feeling of dystrophy and pleuritic pain of three days' evolution, with significant left pleural effusion. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started. New PPD: 36mm. The effusion was studied by CT scan, two thoracentesis and bronchoscopy, in which the exhaustive study for TB was negative. Finally, a pleural biopsy was performed by videothoracoscopy, with negative cultures but with caseifying granulones in the pathological anatomy suggestive of tuberculous pleuritis and positive PCR in the sample. The patient received treatment with RHPZx2+RHx4 months, with resolution of the symptoms.
