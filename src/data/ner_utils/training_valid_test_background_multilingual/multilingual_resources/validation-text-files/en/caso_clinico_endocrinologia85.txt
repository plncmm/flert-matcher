A girl aged 18 months came to the hospital with a seizure, muscular hypotonia and suspected encephalitis. Laboratory tests showed non-ketotic hypoglycaemia (19mg/dl) and metabolic acidosis with elevated GAP anion. A study of hypoglycaemia in children was performed with the following results: very low excretion of leucine metabolites, decreased levels of free carnitine and normal levels of total and esterified carnitine. A diagnosis of suspected 3OH methylglutaric aciduria was made and confirmed by skin biopsy.
The clinical manifestations of 3OH methylglutaric aciduria usually occur in the first 2 years of life and consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscular hypotonia, decreased level of consciousness. During crises, hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis (due to accumulation of metabolites) occur and are triggered by infections, prolonged fasting or infections.
Treatment is started with a diet low in proteins of high biological value, amino acid supplementation free of leucine and carnitine, and the patient is advised to avoid prolonged fasting. With the corrections made, the patient progressed well, with only one admission for hypoglycaemia associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis. During the follow-up, a genetic study was performed: probably pathogenic variant in apparent homozygosis: c.575t>C (p.Phe192Ser) in the HMGCL gene.
At 21 years of age, he presented with diabetes with associated cardinal symptoms and was started on basal bolus insulin therapy. Laboratory tests showed C-peptide: 0.54ng/ml, Negative anti-insulin, Negative anti-tyrosine phosphatase (IA2), Negative anti-glutamate decarboxylase, GAD65 >250 UI/ml U/mL. Currently the patient has good metabolic control with glycosylated haemoglobin of 6.1%.

The association of both diseases has not been previously described in the literature. We are dealing with a patient with type 1 DM who cannot present metabolic ketoacidosis due to her HMGCL enzyme deficiency.
