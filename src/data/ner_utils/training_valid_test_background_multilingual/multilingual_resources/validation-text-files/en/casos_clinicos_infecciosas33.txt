The patient is a 47-year-old male, ex-smoker for 20 years (IPA 21 packs/year), heavy drinker until 7 months prior to admission. He lives with his parents in a complicated socio-family environment. His personal history includes arterial hypertension on treatment with enalapril 20mg with frequent episodes of hypotension and erratic compliance with the treatment. Lacunar stroke in the left hemisphere without sequelae, for which he was taking ASA 300mg, vertiginous syndrome as a sequela of an acoustic trauma, which he treated with sulpiride 50mg and betahistine 16mg, as well as bromazepam 1.5mg to control anxiety after alcohol withdrawal. He underwent surgery for an umbilical hernia and appendectomy.

In the previous months, he had been seen by his primary care physician for a weight loss of more than 15 kg over 9 months and anaemia that did not improve with oral iron; in view of this and two positive faecal occult blood tests, it was decided to admit him to hospital to complete the study. She presented with severe asthenia, anorexia and intermittent periumbilical abdominal pain that was exacerbated by movement. Of interest, she reported having had several episodes of rectorrhagia lasting 1 month 2 years ago for which she did not consult a doctor. She had no symptoms of digestive pathology and no fever had been recorded. Physical examination revealed physical deterioration and poor nutritional status, with a BMI on admission of 16 kg/m2. He was conscious, oriented and cooperative but bradypsychic, with blood pressure 110/80 and temperature 37,4oC. He had increased skin pigmentation. The neck showed small lymphadenopathies in the right anterior jugular chain, without jugular ingurgitation or goitre, cardiopulmonary auscultation was unremarkable, the abdomen was depressible, not painful on palpation, without masses or visceromegaly, with preserved peristalsis. The lower extremities were free of oedema and distal pulses were preserved. The rest of the anamnesis by organs and apparatus showed no relevant data, including the neurological examination, which was normal.

Haemoglobin was 9.1 g/dL with a haematocrit of 30%, MCV 77.7fl, no leukocytosis with 82% neutrophils and 12.8% lymphocytes, thrombocytosis (620,000/ul) and a G.S.V. of 58mm/h. The TTPa was 40.60". The anaemia study showed a deficit of both serum iron and transferrin and a decrease in the saturation index, with the rest of the study, including vitamin B12 and folic acid, being normal. Tumour markers were also requested: CEA, CA 19.9, squamous cell antigen were negative, enolase-NSE positive. Biochemistry, liver and thyroid function and urine test were normal, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound showed inflammatory signs in the small intestine. Thoracic-abdominal CT showed hilar and mediastinal adenopathies in the paratracheal region with septal thickening of the bronchial walls and ground glass lesions as well as some pleural thickening with calcifications. The study of the abdomen was unaltered. The barium swallow showed findings compatible with a regional inflammatory picture or malabsorptive component. Pancolonoscopy and ileoscopy were normal and gastroscopy of the bulb and second duodenal portion showed whitish mucosa, biopsies of which were taken to rule out diffuse lymphangiectasia. Laboratory tests were extended to rule out malabsorptive syndrome, showing hypoproteinaemia (5.8g/dl) with hypoalbuminaemia (2.8g/dl) and beta 2 microglobulin 4.40mg/l. Angiotensin converting enzyme increased.

The patient presented clinical and analytical data of calorie-protein malnutrition. At the same time, the patient presented during his stay in hospital with low-grade fever, presenting an isolated peak of 39.2oC, which was not noticed by the patient and was probably present in recent months. Blood cultures were taken at this time. The patient also reported dyspnoea and dizziness on walking. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to complete the study of the fever of unknown origin.

Differential diagnosis
The possibility of a digestive neoplasm was raised, but endoscopic studies showed no such findings, while analyses indicated hypoproteinaemia and severe hypoalbuminaemia, which was associated with protein-losing enteropathy even in the absence of diarrhoea. A possible infective endocarditis was suggested as the cause of the fever.

Evolution
Histological reports of duodenal and ileal biopsy were consistent with Whipple's disease. PCR for Tropheryma whipplei was positive for Whipple's disease. Transthoracic and later transesophageal echocardiography were highly suggestive of aortic endocarditis with moderate aortic insufficiency. Blood cultures were repeatedly negative before starting antibiotic therapy and serology for endocarditis-producing germs was also negative except for a few positive IgG values for Chlamydophila pneumoniae with negative IgM of little significance. A diagnosis of aortic valve endocarditis due to Tropheryma Whipplei with moderate aortic insufficiency and Whipple's disease with cardiac and digestive involvement with secondary malabsorption and calorie-protein malnutrition was established and treatment with ceftriaxone 2g per day intravenously for 4 weeks was started, followed by treatment for a year with cotrimoxazole 800mg/160mg without requiring valve replacement. Protein supplements were added to the diet. After initiation of treatment, the patient was asymptomatic, with disappearance of the wart on the aortic valve and a weight gain of 16 kg.

Final diagnosis
Endocarditis on aortic valve due to Tropheryma whipplei with moderate aortic insufficiency. Whipple's disease with cardiac and digestive involvement with secondary malabsorption and calorie-protein malnutrition.
