Healthy 21 year old male patient, presenting LDT after falling off a bicycle; with complicated coronary fracture of teeth 12, 11 and 21, with an evolution of 48 hours.
Due to the evolution of two days since the accident, the patient presented pain and inflammation on extraoral examination. During the intraoral examination, pulp exposure of the teeth involved was observed and emergency treatment was indicated to reduce the pain and inflammation.

Emergency treatment
This consisted of the removal of the dental fragments in order to have a better view of the area and the possible treatment to be carried out. It was performed under local anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000, then pulpectomy was performed on teeth 12, 11 and 21 leaving a 35% calcium hydroxide medication (UtraCal® XS, pH 12.5, Ultradent) and as a temporary cure a glass ionomer. 

Diagnosis
Patient with gummy smile presenting complicated crown fracture of tooth 21 in the middle coronal third and tooth 12 in the cervical third, complicated crown and root fracture of tooth 11; gingivitis induced by dentobacterial plaque, transposition of teeth 13 and 14, true anodontia of teeth 15, 35 and 45, presenting temporary teeth 55, 75 and 85.

Treatment plan
Phase I periodontal
Interconsultation with the Department of Orthodontics to direct the treatment in an interdisciplinary way, carrying out the alignment of tooth 13 and orthodontic extrusion of the teeth that suffered LDT.

Crown lengthening for endodontic and restorative purposes
With a 15c scalpel blade, an internal bevel incision is made and then an intrasurface incision is made to remove a gingival collar and continue to raise a full thickness flap to expose the remaining root structure. Measurements are made with a periodontal probe to determine the amount of bone tissue to be removed with osteotomy and osteoplasty to ensure the necessary splinting effect for provisional restorations. The osteotomy is measured with the probe to ensure a minimum osteotomy of 3 mm and sutured with simple stitches. In the clinical history, the patient revealed that his upper central incisor teeth had diastemas, so during the same surgery the upper labial frenulum was released by means of a frenillectomy, as its insertion was low.


Treatment of the root canal system
Once the crown lengthening surgery had healed, there was more tooth structure, which facilitated and ensured isolation to form the canals with manual instruments (K-FlexoFile, Dentsply Maillefer) and balanced forces, irrigation protocol with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and vertical obturation with Schilder technique using MTA Fillapex endodontic cement (Angelus®).

Reconstruction with fibreglass posts
With absolute isolation, deobturation is carried out with Schilder vertical compacting instruments, control radiographs are taken of deobturation and adjustment of the RelyXTM Fiber Post® 1.3Ø yellow (3M ESPE). The canal is etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 20 sec, rinsed with water spray and dried with paper points; cementation of the glass fibre endo post and coronal reconstruction is performed with the Rebilda DC® (VOCO) resin cement system, and a cementation control X-ray is taken.19,20 After the reconstructed and prepared restorations have been thoroughly bonded, it is planned to cement the Telio Lab (Ivoclar Vivadent) long-lasting temporaries with glass ionomer for the patient's comfort and aesthetics.

Cementation of the temporaries
They were cemented with KetacTM Cem glass ionomer (3M ESPE), and sent to orthodontics for treatment.

Periodontal control during the start of orthodontic treatment
The patient was scheduled for a personal plaque control appointment and was given indications for brushing with the current orthodontic appliance. During this periodontal control appointment, dentoalveolar radiographs were taken, in which root resorption was observed, which could be attributed to an inflammatory response of the periodontal ligament in response to trauma or orthodontic movements.
