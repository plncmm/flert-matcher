We present the case of a 48-year-old male, independent (Barthel 100-ECOG 1), with schizoaffective disorder under mental health follow-up and treatment with paliperidone and olanzapine as the only medical history. She consults for fever, weakness and generalised tremor of 48 hours of evolution. His relatives report confusion and stupor at home. She had upper respiratory symptoms with cough and odynophagia, with no other symptoms.
Initial physical examination revealed only a tendency towards hypertension and tachycardia, with a fever of 37.8oC. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.
Blood tests showed elevated acute phase reactants (13800 leukocytes, 82% neutrophils, C-reactive protein 35.7, procalcitonin 3.64), as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis (CPK 23491 with acute renal failure, without ionic alterations). In addition, a chest X-ray was requested, which was normal, and a CT scan of the skull, with no pathological findings. Initially, the respiratory origin of the fever was assumed.
Treatment was started with serum therapy and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, but the patient presented a rapid clinical worsening, persisting with fever up to 41oC, tachycardic, sweating, tremor and significant generalised rigidity. At this point, a differential diagnosis was considered, ranging from infection of the central nervous system to pharmacological origin of the symptoms, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
It was decided to perform a lumbar puncture, in which data compatible with meningoencephalitis of probable bacterial origin were observed (cloudy fluid, 1500 cells, 75% polymorphonuclear, decreased glucose, increased protein and lactate), so antibiotic coverage was extended with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin. Finally, Lysteria monocytogenes DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's initial evolution was torpid, with prolonged admission to intensive care and the need for occasional dialysis, but with a progressive final improvement.
In this case, infection stands out as a non-traumatic cause of rhabdomyolysis, which, if not diagnosed early, can lead to acute renal failure. There are several cases described in the literature associating Lysteria meningoencephalitis and rhabdomyolysis, due to direct invasion and toxic degeneration of myocytes. This micro-organism has been shown to have a higher incidence than other aetiological agents in this condition.
