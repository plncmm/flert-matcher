Anamnesis
33-year-old male, smoker, ex-severe drinker, occasional cocaine user, with a history of fatty liver, gynaecomastia associated with fatty liver, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, oral and genital candidiasis treated with itraconazole. She presented to the Neurology outpatient clinic with progressive symptoms of 2 weeks' evolution of proximal weakness in the upper limbs, paresthesia and pain in the lower limbs, dysphonia and dysphagia for liquids. He reported no fever, no headache, no weight loss, no insect bites, no joint swelling, and no sphincter disturbance.

Physical examination
Vital signs were within normal limits, the general physical examination was normal, except for some whitish lesions on the oral mucosa. On neurological examination the higher functions were preserved. Speech was dysphonic. Confrontational campimetry was normal. Pupils were isochoric and normoreactive to light. Extrinsic ocular motility was preserved, without nystagmus, with doubtful left ptosis. On examination, the rest of the cranial nerves were normal. Muscular system: the right upper limb showed marked paresis (3/5) associated with atrophy of the ipsilateral shoulder, minimal weakness in the biceps and in the extensor muscles of the third and fourth fingers (4+/5). On the left upper limb, there was a paresis (4+/5) in the shoulder, and a paresis (4/5) for flexion of the thumb with evident atrophy of the tenar eminence of that hand. In the lower limbs, a paresis (4/5) was observed for psoas and quadriceps. The tricipital and lower limb osteotendinous reflexes were abolished. Bilateral flexor flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex. Fasciculations in the right shoulder. Hypoaesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left thigh, right arm and both feet. Coordination and gait without alterations.

Complementary tests
- Normal haemogram and coagulation. Normal biochemistry except for GOT 113 IU/l, GPT 770 IU/l, GGT 97 IU/l. Normal thyroid hormones. ESR 67 mm/h. Urinalysis: leucocyturia and nitrites negative.
- Anti-NDNA, anti-mitochondrial, anti-smooth muscle, anti-LKM1, ANCA and ANA antibodies negative. Proteinogram and complement were normal.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): 2 leukocytes, 0 red blood cells, proteins, glucose and ADA without alterations. Cytology, ordinary CSF culture and B-K Lowestein without alterations.
- Serology: HIV positive, cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG (+) IgM (-), Epstein-Barr virus IgG (+) IgM (-), varicella zoster virus IgG (+) IgM (-), herpes simplex virus IgG (+), Brucella (-), Borrelia burgdorferi (-), Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG (+) IgM (-). Negative HCV and HBV serologies.
- PCR for CMV positive in blood and CSF. Enterovirus, HSV 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, negative DM. Serum HIV viral load 1,840 copies/ml.
- Cellular immunity: CD4 92.8/mm3, CD8 284.2/mm3.
- Complete brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): no significant findings.
- Electroneurography: findings compatible with multiple mononeuropathy, showing left ulnar motor and sensory neuropathy with blockage in the forearm. Decreased motor amplitudes of more than 50% of the left median nerve with respect to the right and of the right posterior tibial and right peroneal nerves with respect to the left, with sensory indemnity.
- Electromyography: evidence of recent active denervation in all the muscles explored (left and right gastrocnemius, right tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis).

Diagnosis
Mononeuritis multiplex. Stage B3 HIV infection.

Treatment
Ganciclovir at a dose of 5 mg/kg/12 hours intravenous for 3 weeks. After a decrease in CMV viral load, maintenance treatment with valganciclovir 900 mg/12 h orally was prescribed. HIV-specific treatment with emtricitabine 200 mg/24 h, tenofovir 245 mg/24 h, durunavir 800 mg/24 h and ritonavir 100 mg/24 h was started.

Evolution
After initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the patient developed immune reconstitution syndrome and atypical pneumonia, leading to readmission a few days after discharge. On the other hand, during the study of the clinical picture, he presented a progressive and rapid clinical deterioration in a few days, experiencing a marked progression of weakness and sensibility in all four extremities.

The evolution after 6 months was partial recovery. At the proximal level of the lower limbs and distally in the upper limbs, there remained a 4/5 paresis and an inability to flex or abduct the right shoulder. The neurophysiological control study showed a moderate partial lesion of the right axillary, left median, left ulnar, left radial, right tibial and right peroneal nerves, as well as normal or mild partial lesion in the rest of the nerves explored.

At the functional level, after 6 months of rehabilitation, the patient continued to require help to dress his upper body, was able to eat without assistance, had no limitations in walking, no swallowing or sphincter problems.
