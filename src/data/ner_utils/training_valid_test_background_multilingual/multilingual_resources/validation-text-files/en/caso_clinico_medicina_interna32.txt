A 33-year-old male patient with no medical or surgical history of interest came to the Emergency Department of our centre with fever of up to 39oC and headache of approximately one week's evolution. He had received empirical outpatient treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid without improvement. The temperature was 37.5oC and the physical examination revealed non-painful hepatosplenomegaly. No heart murmurs were heard. Laboratory tests showed mild pancytopenia [Hb 11.8 mg/dL, haematocrit 35.2 %, MCV 90.4 fl, MCH 30.3 g/dL, 4110 leukocytes /mm3 (77% MNP/15.8 %L/2.9%M)], discrete alteration of cytolysis liver enzymes (GOT/GPT 58/92 U/L, LDH 230 U/L, FA/GGT 142/100 U/L BiT 0.5 mg/dL), alteration of coagulation APTT/APTT ratio 56.5/ 1.82 and elevated CRP 202 mg/dL. The patient was admitted to our department for investigation. Urinalysis, chest X-ray and CSF biochemistry were normal. An abdominal ultrasound was performed showing a notable hepatosplenomegaly, an image of probable abscess versus necrotic area in the lower splenic pole measuring approximately 41x26 mm and a high retroperitoneal adenopathy measuring 17 mm. The imaging study was completed with a thoraco-abdominal CT scan showing condensation-atelectasis of the left lower lobe of the lung and splenomegaly associated with an image suggestive of splenic ischaemic lesion without being able to rule out abscessation, with normal liver parenchyma. A transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out endocarditis. Blood and stool cultures, bacterial antigen detection and detection of adenovirus and rotavirus in stool were negative. Serology was negative for Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis A, B and C virus, Leishmania, Brucella, Entamoeba histolytica, Coxiella burnetti stage II and Salmonella tiphy and paratiphy (seroagglutination). However, the results were weakly positive for IgM of Parvovirus B19 with negative IgG, and the IgM values quadrupled in a control test performed one week later. A thrombophilia study was performed, highlighting the positivity for lupus anticoagulant, protein S activity of 40% and IgM and IgG anti-cardiolipin antibody values above 150 (laboratory detection limit). The rest of the autoimmune study was negative. The subsequent evolution of the clinical picture showed a progressive normalisation of the haemogram, as well as a decrease in CRP and transaminases and he was discharged, after twenty days of admission, asymptomatic, afebrile and with antiplatelet treatment to continue controls in external consultations of Internal Medicine-Infectious Diseases.
