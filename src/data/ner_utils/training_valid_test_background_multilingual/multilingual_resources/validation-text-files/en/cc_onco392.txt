Anamnesis
Male patient aged 78 years, allergic to pyrazolones and without toxic habits. His family history includes a father who died of bladder neoplasia and a brother who died of lung cancer.
His personal history includes arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and surgery for duodenal ulcus in 1969 with subsequent upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, requiring transfusion of blood products, with transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and subsequent diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with biopsy in 1992, followed up since then in the Digestive Department. He has undergone multiple double therapy treatments with interferon+ribavirin in 1996 and then peginterefon alfa-2b+ribavirin in 2009 with partial response and subsequent relapse. His usual treatment was Omeprazole 20mg, Amlodipine 5mg, Losartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 100/25mg, Pregabalin 75mg and Lormetazepam 1mg.
The patient was clinically asymptomatic and underwent check-ups at the gastrointestinal clinic. In the control abdominal ultrasound of November 2013, the patient was found to have chronic diffuse liver disease, a 2-centimetre (cm) nodule in segment VI of the undetermined liver, cholelithiasis and a 12-cm renal cyst in the right kidney. The study was completed with CT (Computerised Axial Tomography) and MRI (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging), which revealed a 28-millimetre (mm) nodular lesion in segment VI, hypervascular in the arterial phase and early washout, compatible with hepatocarcinoma (HCC) as a first possibility; chronic lithiasic cholecystitis and a type II Bosniak right renal cyst.
Given these antecedents, he was assessed by the General Surgery Service, performing cholecystectomy and hepatic segmentectomy on 28.03.14, with pathological anatomy showing moderately differentiated HCC grade II, multinodular morphology with presence of vascular invasion and nerve infiltration.
Postoperatively, the patient presented with a liver abscess that required percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, requiring several admissions. He was subsequently monitored in general surgery consultations and was found to be asymptomatic.

Physical examination
ECOG-0. Weight 80 kilograms (kg). Height 182 cm. Body surface area 2m2. Normal colour, well nourished and hydrated. Hepatomegaly of 2 crossings, and fistulous orifice in right hypochondrium with exit of seropurulent material to the surface. No signs of peritoneal irritation and peristalsis present. The rest of the physical examination was unaltered.

Complementary tests
- A control MRI in October 2014 showed progression of the disease with the appearance of multiple subcentimetric nodular lesions throughout the liver parenchyma, mainly affecting segments VI, VII and VIII, in relation to diffuse HCC. Persistent fistulous tract communicating the surgical cavity with the abdominal wall and small biliary leak. Splenomegaly and portal hypertension were also observed.
- Laboratory tests showed alpha-fetoprotein 105 ng/mL (normal values up to 10 ng/mL), GOT 101U/L, GPT 108 U/L and GGT 259 U/L (normal values up to 40, 45 and 64 U/L respectively) with the rest of the analytical parameters being normal.

Diagnosis
With the diagnosis of unresectable recurrence of HCC on cirrhotic liver due to HCV, he was seen on the first medical oncology visit on 30 October 2014.

Treatment
The patient is a candidate for oral treatment with sorafenib 200 mg, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 2 tablets every 12h, starting on 05 November 2014. During treatment, he developed grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity and haematological toxicity, especially grade 3 plateletopenia, which led to temporary discontinuation of the drug and its subsequent reintroduction at half the dose.

Evolution
He continued treatment for 4 months with sorafenib and tests were requested to check the response to treatment, showing progressive elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (187 ng/mL) and in the control MRI of February 2015, progression of the disease with the appearance of new subcentimetric nodular lesions and growth of those already known distributed throughout the liver parenchyma, mainly affecting segments VI and VII. At the same time, growth of the surgical site of the previous lumpectomy occupied by a bilioma was observed, with no evidence of superinfection.
Given the MRI findings and in the absence of active treatment for the neoplastic process, it was decided to continue with symptomatic treatment only. The patient continued monthly check-ups at the medical oncology department and was found to be practically asymptomatic except for grade 1 asthenia and was leading a normal active life.
A new MRI in September 2015 showed a decrease in overall liver volume, especially in segments VI and VII, together with a marked decrease in the number and size of the lesions seen in previous studies. The residual lesions are hypovascular in the dynamic study without being able to identify enhancements in the arterial phase, typical of hepatocarcinoma, which suggests spontaneous regression of the neoplastic disease or infectious/inflammatory origin of the previous lesions.
In view of these findings, he underwent another MRI scan in January 2016, in which no foci of pathological enhancement in the arterial phase suspected of hepatocarcinoma were identified, and analytically, alpha-protein levels decreased progressively until they were within normal limits (4.3 ng/mL). The patient, in turn, has been monitored by the gastrointestinal department, which, after not finding any suspicious images of hepatocarcinoma in the imaging tests, requested in January 2016 a combination of three antiviral drugs (ombitasvir 12.5mg/paritaprevir 75mg/ritonavir 50 mg) together with dasabuvir 250 mg and ribavitin, which were approved and started in April 2016, with good tolerance except for grade 1 asthenia as a side effect. Analytically, a progressive decrease in HCV viral load has been observed since the start of these treatments.
On the other hand, she has been monitored by general surgery due to reducible epigastric eventration, pending eventroplasty and drainage of the abscess if possible, which will be carried out once antiviral treatment is completed, scheduled for July 2016. Subsequently, a new appointment will be made with the medical oncology department for further follow-up.
