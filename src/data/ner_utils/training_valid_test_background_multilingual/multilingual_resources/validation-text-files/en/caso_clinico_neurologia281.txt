Anamnesis
A 66-year-old man from Colombia, hypertensive, diabetic on insulin treatment, dyslipidaemic and with a history of ischaemic heart disease. Kidney transplant recipient due to diabetic nephropathy (fourth month post-transplant), on immunosuppressive treatment with tacrolimus (11.5 mg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (720 mg/day) and prednisone (5 mg/day).

The patient came to the emergency department with a clinical picture of one week's evolution, consisting of constant, burning pain affecting the entire surface of the scalp, face and neck up to the base of implantation. Since its onset, it had become progressively more intense until acquiring intensity 10/10 on the visual analogue scale. It did not improve with the usual analgesia and was exacerbated by palpation. It did not change with decubitus or Valsalva manoeuvres. It did not follow a circadian rhythm. There was no associated fever, nausea or vomiting. Four days earlier, the patient had undergone bilateral eyelid surgery for a benign skin neoformation. On examination he reported allodynia on palpation of the scalp, face and neck. Ophthalmology examination revealed bilateral conjunctivitis. The rest of the examination was normal, including fundus examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) (16 mmHg in both eyes). The patient was discharged with symptomatic treatment for pain and eye drops for the ophthalmological symptoms. Four days later, he returned to the emergency department due to persistent headache and the appearance of fever in the last 48 hours, with a temperature of up to 40oC, chills and shivering.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 150/90 mmHg; heart rate 113 bpm; temperature 39.6oC; basal oxygen saturation 97%; capillary glycaemia 393 mg/dl. Dry skin and mucous membranes. Well nourished and perfused. Tachypneic. No oral ulcers. Allodynia on palpation of scalp, face and neck. Crackles on pulmonary auscultation. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.
Ophthalmological examination: IOP left eye 20 mmHg, right eye 16 mmHg.
Neurological examination: conscious, attentive, oriented in time, space and person. Language and speech without alterations. Normal bilateral funduscopy. Left ptosis. Edema and ecchymosis of the left upper eyelid, with local temperature increase. Left arreactive mydriasis. In the left eye, extrinsic ocular movements abolished in all directions (including incisional and excisional movements). Ductions in the right eye without limitation. Normal motor and sensory V, VII and lower pairs. Normal motor, sensory and coordination. Negative meningeal signs.

Complementary tests
- Emergency laboratory tests: haemoglobin 9.6 g/dl, haematocrit 28.9%, mean corpuscular volume 84.7 fl, leukocytes 15,600/μl (neutrophils: absolute value 13,200/μl, relative value 84.7%; lymphocytes: absolute value 1,100/μl, relative value 7.3%), platelets 236. 000/μl, C-reactive protein 31.20 mg/dl, normal coagulation, fibrinogen 889 mg/dl, glucose 505 mg/dl, urea 68 mg/dl, creatinine 1.69 mg/dl, sodium 126 mmol/l, potassium 4.8 mmol/l, chlorine 92 mmol/l, lactate dehydrogenase 571 IU/l. Venous blood gases: normal. Urine examination: glycosuria 1,000 mg/dl, ketone bodies 0.
- Lumbar puncture: cerebrospinal fluid with a cloudy appearance. Red blood cells 6/μl, leukocytes 1,100/μl (polymorphonuclear 95%, mononuclear 5%), protein 78 mg/dl, glucose 110 mg/dl, cryptococcal antigen (Ag) negative. Fungal and bacteriological culture: negative. Cytology negative for malignancy.
- Chest X-ray: normal.
- Cranial and orbital computed tomography (CT): preseptal soft tissue enlargement, lateral to the left eyeball and adjacent to the ocular insertion of the left lateral rectus muscle, compatible with orbital cellulitis. Occupation of the left sphenoid sinus and right maxillary sinus in relation to an inflammatory process.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: occupation of the sphenoid sinus, with thickening of the mucosa and a central image of about 2 cm in its interior, markedly hypointense in T2 and hyperintense in T1. Asymmetric enhancement of the wall of the left cavernous sinus and orbital apex in relation to an inflammatory process in the vicinity. Hyperintense foci in the FLAIR sequence at the level of the deep white matter of both frontal lobes, right parietal lobe and left occipital lobe and head of the left caudate nucleus, with restriction in the diffusion sequence and without enhancement after intravenous contrast, compatible with acute infarcts. The angiographic sequence showed an absence of filling of the cavernous sinus, distal portion of the sphenoparietal sinus and left-sided petrosal sinuses, suggestive of cavernous sinus thrombosis.
- Pathological anatomy of the nasosinusal mucosa: bacterial colonies intermingled with abundant thick-walled, non-septate, multi-branched filamentous fungal structures showing little or no staining with routine technique (haematoxylin and eosin).
- Nasosinusal exudate culture: colonisation by Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococccus hominis hominis and Streptococcus viridans group.

Diagnosis
- Rhino-orbitocerebral mucormycosis (RORM).
- Septic thrombosis of the left cavernous sinus.
- Multiple cerebral infarcts secondary to vascular fungal invasion.

Treatment and evolution
This was a diabetic and immunosuppressed patient (fourth month post-renal transplant), with a ten-day clinical picture of holocranial, facial and cervical pain and allodynia, which in the last 48 hours was associated with fever with shivering. Examination showed paralysis of the III, IV and VI left cranial nerves, with mydriasis arreactiva, a slight increase in IOP and signs of left orbital cellulitis. Initially, the level of consciousness was good and there was no evidence of meningismus or other focality. The patient met clinical and laboratory criteria for sepsis. Given these findings, intracranial infection with involvement of the left cavernous sinus and/or an intraorbital infectious process with involvement of the superior orbital fissure was suspected. Cranial CT scan showed left sphenoidal sinusitis and orbital cellulitis. In view of the suspicion of a disseminated intracranial infectious process, a lumbar puncture was performed, which showed polymorphonuclear pleocytosis. Gram and Ag for cryptococcus were negative.

Empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftacidime, linezolid and ampicillin was started immediately. In the following hours the patient's level of consciousness worsened. An urgent brain MRI was performed, which showed thrombosis of the left cavernous sinus and occupation of the left sphenoidal sinus suggestive of fungal sinusitis. Coronal and axial slices of the brain MRI, T1-weighted sequence. Occupation of the left sphenoid sinus with a central hyperintense image of about 2 cm in its interior. Asymmetric enhancement of the left cavernous sinus wall and orbital apex. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was added at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day and an urgent sphenoidectomy was performed the following day. Despite this, the patient continued with fluctuating level of consciousness and required admission to intensive care for neurological monitoring. Immunosuppressive medication was reduced to minimal doses, caspofungin was added and anticoagulation with intravenous heparin was started. Pathological examination showed tissue invasion by non-septate filamentous fungus, compatible with mucormycosis. Nasosinusal mucosa. Haematoxylin-eosin stain, objective 20x magnification. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) technique, objective 40x magnification. Acute inflammatory infiltrate and tissue invasion by thick-walled, non-septate, multi-branched filamentous fungi.

During the course of the disease, the patient presented right hemiparesis, related to acute infarcts in the left thalamus and internal capsule, probably secondary to vascular fungal invasion. Despite therapeutic measures, he evolved unfavourably with progressive worsening of the level of consciousness, and finally died 17 days after admission.
