43-year-old woman, smoker with a smoking habit of 10 years/packet with no personal or family history of interest, who in September 2018 was admitted to another hospital for months of weight loss and progressive weakness with marked muscle atrophy. On admission, he was diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.

At discharge, he was still unable to stand upright, so he had UHD support and was being treated with high-dose dexamethasone (8-4-8 mg) and third-step analgesics (fentanyl patches 100 Î¼g/h).

She requested a second opinion at our centre, attending on 22/10/18 before the visit due to familial claudication; with poor pain control (headache due to brain metastases and right sciatic pain due to L5 lesion and crushing) despite increased analgesia and corticotherapy, with urinary and faecal incontinence starting in the last 2-3 weeks together with increased weakness in MMII. In the last few days a confusional syndrome with delusions of harm had also been added.

The patient had a BP of 4 and was oriented in person and partially oriented in time and space; on physical examination she presented significant cachexia, with asymmetrical atrophy of the quadriceps, interosseus and tenar eminence, leading to left claw hand. The motor balance showed generalised weakness, with scores of 3 out of 5 on the ASIA scale in the distal extremities and 4 out of 5 in the proximal extremities. Sensibility was normal and there was no alteration of cranial nerves. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

The complementary examinations performed at the other centre included:
- Brain and cervical spine MRI (18/09/2018): cerebral and cerebellar metastases with haemorrhagic component, mass effect, compression of the 4th ventricle, intracranial hypertension and herniation of cerebellar tonsils with bulbar compression. Bone metastases in the first 3 dorsal levels.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan (18/09/2018): Multiple lesions of metastatic appearance in both lungs predominantly in upper fields, hepatic parenchyma, right adrenal, right kidney, retroperitoneal adenopathies and at bone level in costal arches, somas D1-D3 and soma L5 with anterior epidural component, right iliac blade and left acetabulum.

An echodirected biopsy of one of the liver metastases had been performed there on 24/9/18 (24/9/18), the morphological and immunohistochemical study of which showed a metastasis of PD-L1 + (low expression) 1-49% lung adenocarcinoma; ALK and ROS 1 not translocated, pending the result of the EGFR mutation.

Therefore, in the case of a young woman with a very poor baseline general condition and very advanced lung adenocarcinoma, with a high disease burden due to multiple metastases and uncontrolled pain, admission was decided to optimise symptomatic treatment, including analgesia and cerebral anti-edema measures with an increase in the dose of dexamethasone (8mg every 8h), with initial partial symptomatic improvement.

Subsequently, after ruling out spinal cord involvement with spinal MRI, palliative holocranial RT was started (10 fractions x 3 Gy, which ended on 05/11/18).

On 31/10/18 the EGFR result was received, showing a deletion in exon 19, so treatment with Erlotinib 150mg/24h was prescribed (with prior informed consent).

At the same time, rehabilitation/physiotherapy treatment was started due to prolonged bedridden syndrome and muscle atrophy attributable to immobility and the use of Dexamethasone.

With these measures, the patient began a process of slow but evident improvement in her general and functional state with good pain control and progressive recovery of mobility and personal autonomy, which allowed the progressive reduction of corticotherapy.

On 18/11/18, while on a dose of 2mg/day of dexamethasone, the patient presented a febrile peak with no accompanying symptoms, with no findings on examination, with complementary examinations (blood tests, urine, respiratory viruses and chest X-ray), so empirical antibiotherapy with cefditoren was started.

Despite broadening the antibiotic spectrum to piperacillin-tazobactam, the febrile peaks persisted; on 22/11/18 he presented with marked clinical deterioration, with low reactivity, drowsiness, desaturation up to 60% (ambient air) and scattered crackles. The chest X-ray was repeated and showed a new extensive reticulonodular pattern in both hemithoraxes, so, on suspicion of atypical or viral pneumonia, levofloxacin, cotrimoxazole at therapeutic doses and ganciclovir were associated. Despite the administration of oxygen therapy (Ventimask with FiO2 50%), the patient persisted with dyspnoea and significant tachypnoea; therefore, intensive care was consulted for placement of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (optiflow) on the ward.

With this maximum support on the ward, the patient was stabilised. The compromised respiratory situation prevented bronchoscopy to take a sample and microbiological filiation at the acute stage, but a thoracic CT scan was performed on 26/11/18 which showed extensive bilateral patchy and confluent involvement in ground glass, together with blood tests that showed a slight elevation of acute phase reactants but clear elevation of LDH, which raised Pneumocystis jirovecci pneumonia as the main diagnostic suspicion.

From an initial need for oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 80%, a slow but progressive improvement was achieved at respiratory level, without repeated febrile peaks, allowing the transition to Ventimask on 4/12/18 and to nasal goggles on 13/12/18.

The microbiological analyses of blood (blood cultures, CMV viral load) collected during the febrile peaks and sputum (culture, Aspergillus DNA, Pneumocystis DNA), collected when the patient's clinical situation allowed (11/12/18) showed no isolation; antibiotherapy was progressively withdrawn until only cotrimoxazole at prophylactic doses was left.

A control thoracic-abdominal CT scan was performed on 18/12/18 which showed resolution of the ground glass areas and improvement of the metastatic nodules with partial response criteria, allowing hospital discharge on 21/12/18 without the need for any home support, with a PS of 1 asymptomatic except for G1 skin toxicity due to erlotinib at her outpatient visit one month after discharge.
