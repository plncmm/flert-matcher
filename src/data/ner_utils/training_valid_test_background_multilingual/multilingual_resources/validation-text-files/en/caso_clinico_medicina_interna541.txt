This is a 45-year-old patient with no known cardiovascular risk factors, who smoked only one pack a day. Defined as homosexual, with continuous high-risk sexual relations and use of Chemsex without intravenous drugs (GHB and Poppers).
He presented with progressive asthenia and the appearance of a violaceous papular rash on the trunk and extremities of 3 days' evolution, for which he went to his MAP and was referred to our hospital for assessment.
The initial physical examination revealed extreme thinness, different lesions in different stages, some violaceous papules, vesicles and some haematic crusts with necrotic centre on the trunk and limbs, including the face, palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and a non-painful ulcer on the palatal border of the tongue. The rest was normal.
He was assessed together with dermatology at 24 hours, and it was decided to take a biopsy of a lesion, as well as aspiration of fluid from a vesicle. Laboratory tests confirmed HIV positivity with an initial viral load of 150,000 copies and a lymphocyte mass of 400 CD4+. The result of the biopsy showed non-specific inflammation but the bladder aspirate in the trunk showed the presence of Treponema pallidum, confirming high titres of positivity in the general analysis.
A review of the literature was carried out due to the atypical nature of the skin lesions, which initially raised doubts about the possibility of varicella activation. The description of a very rare form of presentation of luetic secundarism called malignant syphilis, which can occur in patients with impaired cellular immunity, is noted. The presence of the bacterium in the lesions confirms the diagnostic hypothesis. Within a week of treatment with benzathine penicillin the lesions had disappeared.
Few cases of this form of presentation have been described, however, in a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection it should always be kept in mind as part of the differential diagnosis.
