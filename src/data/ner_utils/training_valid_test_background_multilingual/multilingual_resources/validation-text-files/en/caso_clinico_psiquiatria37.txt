Male, 25 years old, single, living with his parents. He has worked odd jobs, but is currently unemployed for 5 years.

He has no personal medical history of interest except for an admission for an eye perforation. His mother suffers from "depressions", no other psychiatric or medical history of interest is reported.

He presents a history of several years of evolution of extravagant behaviour, but not dangerous or annoying for others, in addition to a strange physical appearance, with long and unkempt hair, extremely thin, and a non-verbal behaviour full of micro gestures and mannerisms. The patient says that he does not want to be like normal people, "I am not interested in being like everyone else". He says that he does not work because he does not know what to do in the future. In hospital, he exhibited many strange behaviours such as small blows to the prescribed serum, straggly flowers picked in the hospital garden on the headboard of the bed, continuous movements, touching objects with an impression of curiosity. For the last year and a half, the extravagant behaviour has intensified, he spent many nights away from home, hardly sleeping and without explaining where he was going. He began to comment that he was Jesus Christ, that he had the nails in his hand. His room was full of Bibles, candles and images of saints. He walked down the street as "if he were Jesus Christ", half naked, saying that his spine was broken. He said that he had sexual relations with the Virgin Mary. On one occasion he flogged himself in a church with a chain. On another occasion he went out into the street with a sword and showed it to some children, and the police came at that time. They noted that he talks to himself. At home he does not interact with the family and, on occasions, he has threatened his mother that "I will nail you with the nails of Christ", but without showing physical aggression. When asked if he considers himself to be Jesus Christ, he replies that it is others who believe it, that he hears people commenting about him that he "looks like Jesus Christ", and that sometimes he has even heard it through closed doors or people have insinuated it on television or the radio. He shows supposed marks on his hands that support this belief.

Regarding intoxicating habits, he only acknowledges using cannabis for years, with no evidence of other consumption and no information about the amount of cannabis consumed or when it started. It does seem to be a daily consumption and possibly in significant quantities according to information from the family.

In the psychopathological examination, the extravagant behaviour, mystical delusions, possible auditory hallucinations that do not seem to be very intense or frequent, without other types of sensory-perceptual alterations, inadequate affectivity and impoverished thinking, with thoughts centred on the same subject, without suicidal ideation, nor manic or depressive symptoms, nor sleep disturbances. Perseverative conversation focused on justifying their bizarre behaviours. Little awareness of illness and tendency to hide information.

One year later, after treatment first with quetiapine and later with olanzapine, the use of cannabis has subsided and he continues to deny the use of other intoxicants. No delusional or hallucinatory symptoms are evident. Negative symptoms predominate, with impoverished speech, significant social withdrawal, flattened affectivity and persistent extravagant behaviour.
