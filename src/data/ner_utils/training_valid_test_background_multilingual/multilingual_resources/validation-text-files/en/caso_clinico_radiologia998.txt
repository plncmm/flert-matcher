80-year-old male with fever, productive cough, haemoptysis and weight loss.
This radiograph shows infiltrates in both upper lobes with cavities, suggestive of active pulmonary TB. In general, thin walled cavities (<5mm) tend to be infectious and, when the wall is thick (>10mm) squamous cell carcinoma enters the differential diagnosis.
TB usually affects upper lobes and the apical segment of lower lobes. However, within the upper lobe, involvement of the anterior segment is rare.
Diagnosis is confirmed by staining a sputum specimen with Ziel Nielssen stain and culture on Lowenstein's medium.
Upper lobe cavitary disease correlates well with very positive sputum and is therefore highly contagious.
Other differential dx of cavitary disease include infection by: Staphylococci, Klebsiella, anaerobes and non-infectious causes such as: squamous cell carcinoma, pulmonary infarction, Wegener's granulomatosis and rheumatoid nodules.
