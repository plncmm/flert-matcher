A 67-year-old man, slightly overweight and with no relevant past history, presented to the emergency department with fever (37.8°C) and mild respiratory symptoms. After a diagnosis of COVID-19, he was sent home with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Five days later, he was readmitted to the emergency department with worsening asthenia and fever. On physical examination, the patient presented with anasarca, respiratory rate of 32 r.p.m. and bibasal rales on auscultation, mainly in the right lung. Ambient air oxygen saturation was 87%. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and cobblestone pattern in the right lung. C-reactive protein (114.1 mg/L, normal range < 6 mg/L), fibrinogen (711 mg/dL, normal range 150-400 mg/dL) and D-dimer (1.83 μg/mL, normal range < 0.77 μg/mL) values were elevated. Furthermore, the association of hypoalbuminaemia (33.2 g/L, 50.7% of total serum protein), proteinuria (30 mg/dL, normal range 0-15 mg/dL) and anasarca was consistent with a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome added to COVID-19 pneumonia. 
The patient was admitted to a COVID-19 ward and was treated with non-invasive ventilation, ceftriaxone and enoxaparin 6000 IU anti-Xa once daily as antithrombotic prophylaxis. During the first 48 hours, the patient showed no further worsening. However, from the third day of admission, a progressive increase in thrombocyte count (443 x 109/L), D-dimer (3.73 μg/mL) and C-reactive protein (229 mg/L) was observed, as well as a worsening of gas exchange. Consequently, the patient was intubated and transferred to a COVID-19 ICU. On day 5, the patient presented with pain, numbness and coldness in the right lower extremity, as well as a large increase in D-dimer (> 20 μg/mL). A double ultrasound showed complete occlusion of the right iliac and popliteal arteries, for which urgent revascularisation of the lower extremity was performed under general anaesthesia. A 20G catheter was inserted into the right radial artery to monitor invasive blood pressure. To achieve an ACT greater than 250 seconds, three boluses of 1000 IU i.v. UFH were required after an initial dose of 5000 IU. To maintain the target ACT, an additional 6000 IU of UFH was added. Conventional thrombectomy of the right lower extremity was successfully performed with a Fogarty catheter in several approaches (femoral and subgenicular popliteal). A double intraoperative ultrasound scan showed a biphasic flow pattern in the treated arteries. During surgery, the sudden flattening of the arterial wave and the frigidity and pallor of the right upper limb were indicative of limb ischaemia. The clinical suspicion was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound, which detected thrombosis of the right humeral artery. Consequently, a successful right upper limb thrombectomy was performed, restoring patency of the humeral artery. The patient left the operating theatre with a continuous infusion of 1000 IU/h of UFH. Notably, a TTPa ratio of 1.92 was obtained only with an increase of the UFH infusion rate to 2000 IU/h (more than 35,000 IU/day). However, the TTPa ratio dropped to 0.86 during the first postoperative day, leading to a further increase in UFH. On the following day, the occurrence of reactive thrombocytosis explained the reduction of the TTPa ratio from 2.54 to suboptimal values. As the anti-Xa factor test gave a value below therapeutic (0.34 IU/mL), the patient was switched to a UFH regimen of 8000 IU twice daily. Over the next two days, D-dimer decreased to 0.72 μg/mL and anti-Xa activity was between 0.60 and 0.77 IU/mL. During this period, a high dose of norepinephrine (0.25 μg/kg/min) was needed to treat hypotension. On postoperative day 6, the patient presented with persistent bilateral lower extremity acroischemia, including cyanosis of the fingers and toes, skin blistering and dry gangrene with patency of the lower extremity arteries on double ultrasound. Accordingly, prostaglandin E-1 was administered at 60 mcg twice daily. Five days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the COVID-19 ward; twenty days later he was discharged from the hospital on oral anticoagulants. At two-month follow-up, no thromboembolic events had occurred. A slow reduction in D-dimer values was observed, from 3.3 μg/mL to 1.6 μg/mL. The acroischaemic lesions showed gradual improvement without the need for amputation and the patient now attends twice weekly wound care.
