Anamnesis
Our patient is a 46-year-old male, whose father died of hepatocarcinoma when the patient was 16 years old. He has no drug allergies or toxic habits. His personal history includes type III obesity (BMI 40), undergoing gastric reduction with good results, obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) treated with home CPAP for sleep and adaptive disorder since 2012. He has undergone surgery for right knee trauma. Under home treatment with escitalopram 20 mg/d and lorazepam 1 mg/d.
The patient came to the ophthalmology department for a rapidly growing excreting conjunctival lesion in the right eye, having visited the emergency department several times in the previous month for pain and conjunctival erythema, without reporting any loss of vision.

Physical examination
Examination of the right eye revealed a 4.5 x 4 mm, outgrowing, coralliform, ulcerated, partially conjunctival covered, hyperemic lesion. Intraocular pressure in the right eye is 30 mm Hg. Cornea clear, pupils normal. Contralateral eye without findings. No lymph nodes were palpable.

Complementary tests
Ophthalmology performed a gonioscopy. He was scheduled for surgical biopsy of the conjunctival lesion. Bacterial and fungal culture was taken from the same region and HIV serology was extracted.
The gonioscopy showed absence of iridocorneal angle involvement. Anatomical pathology of the surgical biopsy reported fragments of keratinising squamous cell carcinoma. Culture was positive for Alternaria and HIV serology was negative.

Diagnosis
Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma stage I (T1N0M0), without total involvement of one ocular quadrant.

Treatment
The patient was scheduled for excision of the conjunctival lesion, receiving cryotherapy at the margins of the lesion at the time of surgery. Pathology of the surgical specimen showed no affected margins (margin > 4 mm) and no infiltration of the sclera.
From the beginning of the consultations, the patient was treated with prednisone ophthalmic ointment 4 times/day and gentamicin ointment every 8 hours. Following culture results, he was treated with voriconazole c/2 h for 2 weeks.

Evolution
The patient was referred to our clinic. We requested magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit, where an image measuring 10 x 4 x 7 mm, with a nodular appearance, oval and with contrast enhancement, was seen anterior to the right lacrimal gland, which was related to the operation. We contacted Ophthalmology, informing them of the MRI findings, and the patient was kept on follow-up without systemic treatment at the present time.
