We present a 53-year-old man who was admitted to Internal Medicine with fever of 39o and myalgia in the lower limbs for a week, with no personal or epidemiological history of interest. He was treated by his family doctor with azithromycin and levofloxacin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia, without improvement.
On physical examination on admission he was hypotensive, although well perfused and hydrated, with no evidence of sepsis or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary auscultation and examination of the lower limbs were normal. Painful hepatomegaly measuring 3 cm and non-specific skin rash on the trunk, non-pruritic and evanescent in less than 8 hours, were observed.
Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia, with a predominance of neutrophils and a significant left shift (23% of keys) and thrombopenia, with normal red blood count, coagulation and peripheral blood smear, no increase in acute phase reactants and elevated liver function tests (predominantly cholestatic pattern). Proteinogram, urinalysis, chest X-ray and ECG were normal. Blood cultures, urine culture and sputum culture were negative. Serological results ruled out acute infection by Epstein Barr virus, Herpes 1 and 2, Varicella Zoster, Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma, Parvovirus B19, HBV, HCV, HIV, Leishmania, Syphilis, Brucella, Rickettsia, Bartonella, Borrelia and Francisella Turalensis. Seroconversion was observed for Leptospira, with titres above 1:1280. Thoracic-abdominal CT scan showed findings compatible with pneumonia and hepatomegaly with numerous lymphadenopathies in the hepatic hilum.
Empirical treatment with doxycycline was started on admission. After 48 hours, given the persistence of fever, worsening liver function tests and the debut of a bilateral interstitial pulmonary pattern, with normal baseline O2 saturation, ceftriaxone was added. Clinical, analytical and radiological normalisation occurred after 2 weeks.
The case is Leptospirosis in an immunocompetent and previously healthy patient, with hepatic, pulmonary, haematological and dermatological involvement as a form of presentation.
