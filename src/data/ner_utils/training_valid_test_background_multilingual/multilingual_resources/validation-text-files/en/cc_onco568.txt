Anamnesis
We present the case of a 61-year-old male, with no known personal history of interest, ex-smoker with an accumulated pack-year index of 30, with no other toxic habits. He had no family history of interest. He consulted the emergency department in March 2018 due to general malaise and progressive asthenia of 4 months' evolution, without having attended for this reason previously, presenting on arrival with the impossibility of ambulation together with marked dyspnoea at rest.
She also reported weight loss and non-productive cough.

Physical examination
Examination revealed an unkempt physical appearance and mucocutaneous pallor, with raised purplish skin lesions on several areas of the body (mainly the neck, trunk and back), as well as on the oral mucosa, gingival and glans penis. He was bradypsychic without neurological focality, and presented abolition of vesicular murmur in the right pulmonary hemifield.

Complementary tests
He was admitted to Internal Medicine to begin a study, requesting a complete blood analysis with serology, with the results showing a positive HIV-1 Western-Blot, HIV-1 viral load (Taqman): 304,000.00 copies/ml (log: 5.48), lymphopenia with CD4 5.02 %, CD8 77.3 %, CD8 77.3 8 %. Hepatotropic viruses and other serologies were negative except Entamoeba histolytica. General laboratory tests showed moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and protein-calorie malnutrition (albumin 2.1 g/dl).

Diagnosis
Following tests, the patient was diagnosed with advanced HIV infection, stage C3 (AIDS).

Treatment
Antiretroviral treatment with triple therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for opportunistic diseases was started by the Internal Medicine Infectious Diseases Department.

Evolution
During admission, a chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion, so the study was completed with a complete CT scan showing numerous supra- and infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly with ascites and right pleural effusion. Diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed, ruling out infectious involvement, with negative mycobacteria and positive anatomopathological diagnosis for malignant tumour cells, with morphological and immunohistochemical findings consistent with primary cavity lymphoma, positive for herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). A biopsy was also performed on one of the skin lesions and a laterocervical adenopathy, both with histological diagnosis compatible with Kaposi's sarcoma, associated with HHV-8, which also infiltrated oesophageal and gastric mucosa as evidenced by endoscopy.
The patient showed initial clinical and analytical improvement thanks to antiretroviral treatment and supportive treatment during the first weeks, and so, in view of his recovery, it was decided to admit him to the Medical Oncology department to assess tumour treatment. However, three weeks after starting treatment, there was again marked clinical deterioration, fever and worsening laboratory tests, with no microbiological or radiological findings to justify the worsening, in probable relation to immune reconstitution syndrome, although other options (haemophagocytic syndrome, venocclusive disease, etc.) could not be ruled out. Despite treatment, including vasoactive drugs, the patient continued to suffer from sustained hypotension and progressive liver failure, which led to severe, non-reversible hepatic encephalopathy, and he died a few days later.
A clinical autopsy was requested, confined exclusively to the liver, with the final result of acute submassive cholestatic hepatitis of unspecific centrolobulillar predominance, which could be due to HIV or hepatotropic viruses or drug toxicity, without being able to identify the origin.
