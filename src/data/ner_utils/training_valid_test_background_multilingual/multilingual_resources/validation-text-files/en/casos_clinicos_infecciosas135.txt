A 76-year-old man was admitted for febrile syndrome preceded by chills and shivering. His personal history included an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had undergone emergency surgery a year earlier, by endovascular exclusion and placement of an EndurantÂ® aorto-biliac stent with proximal juxta-renal anchorage. A control CT angiography was performed two months after surgery, which showed adequate patency of the prosthesis with no signs of endoleak, being surrounded by a hypodense collection of 10x10x4 cm with enhancement in the venous phase, and multiple loculations extending to the left psoas, interpreted as a haematoma. This angio-CT scan was repeated nine months after surgery (3 months before hospital admission), showing persistence of the periprosthetic collection, although with a significant decrease in size (8x8x2cm). The possibility of an infectious complication was raised, but in the absence of fever, abdominal pain and elevated acute phase reactants, conservative management was decided on the basis of the first diagnostic suspicion.
In the month prior to admission, the patient suffered intermittent and self-limited episodes of fever, predominantly in the evening, preceded by chills and shivering. For this reason, he went to his primary care physician, who diagnosed him with a urinary tract infection and prescribed treatment with ciprofloxacin. After 7 days of treatment, the same symptoms reappeared and he was admitted for further investigation.
Physical examination revealed rhythmic tones at 90 beats per minute, with a V/VI systolic murmur radiating to the axilla not previously described. Pulmonary ascultation and abdominal palpation were normal. There was no oedema in the lower limbs, nor stigmata of systemic embolism. The haemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dl (normocytic-normochromic) with normal white series and platelets. Coagulation was normal and the biochemistry showed CRP of 120 mg/l with normal renal function and normal ions. Chest X-ray was also normal. Bedside echocardiography showed preserved LV diameter and systolic function, with moderate and eccentric mitral regurgitation possibly related to mitral prolapse. The differential diagnosis of endovascular prosthesis infection vs. infective endocarditis (IE) was considered. On admission, given the clinical and haemodynamic stability of the patient, it was decided to take serial blood cultures and await the results to start antibiotic treatment.
In the first 72 hours, growth of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis occurred in 2 out of 4 bottles, so, given the suspicion of infection of the endoprosthesis, without being able to rule out IE, antibiotic treatment was started with ampicillin 2 g/4h and gentamicin 3 mg/kg every 24 hours.
In the first 48h from the start of antibiotic treatment, the patient presented erythematous-violaceous lesions on the soles of the feet, compatible with Osler nodules and abdominal discomfort with vomiting without alteration of intestinal transit. He remained haemodynamically stable and afebrile. After discussing the case with the Vascular Surgery Department, we agreed on conservative antibiotic treatment as opposed to elective surgery due to the high surgical risk.

Differential diagnosis
We considered the differential diagnosis between infection of the stent associated, or not, with IE. The presence of a febrile syndrome with a bacteraemic profile together with the existence of a periprosthetic collection led us to think of stent infection as the first possibility, although the decrease in the collection in serial angio-CT scans supported the possibility of periprosthetic haematoma. However, polymicrobial bacteraemia in a patient with an infrarenal aortic stent from two pathogens responsible for subacute infections supported the infectious aetiology. The microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures, both Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis, are germs present in the oropharyngeal flora, and the patient did not present oral inflammatory/infectious processes or recent dental procedures.
The presence of bacteraemia in the context of a stent infection by pathogens that frequently cause IE, in a patient with valvular pathology and a new-onset murmur, forces us to rule out the existence of bacteraemia.
The natural history of this pathology is extremely variable and is directly related to the causative agent. Thus, it can present as a rapidly progressive acute infection with heart failure, cardiogenic shock and/or systemic embolisms, usually when caused by Staphylococcus spp., but also as a subacute or chronic disease with fever and non-specific symptoms, more typical of those produced by Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Less frequently it is caused by slow-growing pathogens such as Aggregatibacter spp, responsible for 0.3% of infections on native valves and 1.1% of those on prosthetic valves. This larval presentation could be consistent with the clinical presentation of our patient. There are very rare but highly suggestive clinical manifestations of infective endocarditis such as Janeway lesions (erythematous, non-painful macules on the palms and soles), Osler nodules (subcutaneous purplish nodules appearing mainly on the pads of the fingers and toes and on the tenar and hypothenar eminence), and Roth spots (exudative lesions on the retina with a dull centre).
The diagnosis of IE is established using the modified Duke criteria, consisting of major and minor criteria. Our patient met one major criterion (positive blood culture for HACEK group germ) and two minor criteria (fever and immune phenomena such as Osler nodules), with two major criteria or one major and three minor criteria being necessary for the diagnosis of definite infective endocarditis. Echocardiography is the technique of choice for the diagnosis of IE and plays an essential role in the management and monitoring of these patients. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed when transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is negative and there is high clinical suspicion or with positive TTE to rule out local complications. However, there are situations such as mitral prolapse (as in the case of our patient), degenerative lesions and prosthetic valves that decrease the sensitivity of this test. The evaluation of patients with infective endocarditis is no longer limited to conventional echocardiography, but should include other imaging techniques such as multislice CT, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) with F-fluorodeoxyglucose, which is incorporated in vivo by activated leukocytes that accumulate at the site of infection.

Evolution
An angio-CT scan of the abdominal aorta was performed, showing the bifurcated abdominal aortic endoprosthesis with no signs of endoleak and adequate permeability, persisting periprosthetic soft tissue density mass measuring 10.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm (increase with respect to previous ones) with a fluid component in its interior which, via the neck, communicates with the psoas muscle. At this level, the lesion had a watery density and anfractuous borders in relation to the fluid collection, stable with respect to previous studies. In view of these results, we performed CT-guided FNA of the collection, in the sample of which S. oralis and A. aphrophilus grew with the same sensitivity as those isolated in the blood cultures. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed severe mitral insufficiency due to rupture of the chordae tendineae of P2, with no signs suggestive of endocarditis.
Control blood cultures 72 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment were negative. Since the start of antibiotic treatment, the patient no longer presented fever, with progressive improvement in general condition. There was also a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants and recovery of the chronic anaemia. After 14 days of treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin, we continued on an outpatient basis, in a day hospital, with ceftriaxone 2 g/day until the end of the month of treatment. After that, we started levofloxacin 500 mg/day. There were no complications derived from the antibiotic treatment and acute phase reactants remained in the normal range.

Definitive diagnosis
Endovascular prosthesis infection by Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis.
Abscess in left psoas muscle in contact with the endoprosthesis of the same etiology.
