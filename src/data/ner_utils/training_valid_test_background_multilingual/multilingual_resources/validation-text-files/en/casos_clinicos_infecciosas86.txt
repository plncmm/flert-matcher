A 17-year-old male with no known drug allergies and no family, personal or epidemiological history of interest came to the emergency department on two occasions for presenting cough with rusty expectoration and fever of up to 40oC, of 3 days' evolution. After an initial clinical evaluation, with completely normal initial complementary tests (haemogram, biochemistry with renal function and C-reactive protein, coagulation, blood gases and chest X-ray), the patient was discharged with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis and antibiotic treatment (levofloxacin 750 mg every 24 hours) together with antipyretics (paracetamol 1 g/8 hours) and inhalers (salbutamol 200 ug/8hours). After 48 hours, he consulted for persistent symptoms, to which was added on this occasion the appearance of odynophagia together with the presence of lesions in the oral cavity that prevented him from opening completely and made it difficult to swallow liquids and solids. He also reported the presence of lesions on the genital mucosa and distal region of the upper and lower limbs. At this point he was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department. On inspection he was in fair general condition, affected by the dermatological lesions, with a good level of consciousness, haemodynamically stable (blood pressure 105/70), heart rate 90 beats per minute and afebrile. Eupneic at rest despite a basal oxygen saturation of 89% (with oxygen therapy with nasal goggles at 2 litres per minute it rose to 96%). At the laterocervical level, he had small bilateral lymphadenopathies smaller than 1 cm, not attached to deep planes and slightly painful on palpation. There was no nuchal rigidity or other meningeal signs. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed rhythmic tones at 90 bpm with no murmurs and preserved vesicular murmur with scattered wheezing in both lung fields.

Bilateral conjunctival injection and lacrimation were observed in the eye. In the otorhinolaryngological examination we observed, in the oral cavity, pseudomembranous lesions of greyish appearance with fibrinous exudate and vesicular lesions in different stages of evolution that prevented the complete opening of the oral cavity. In the genital region we observed pruritic vesicular lesions, without inguinal adenopathy and without urethral exudate. On the upper and lower extremities, the patient presented skin lesions in the form of erythematous macules that did not affect the palms or soles.

Once again, complementary tests were requested: regular blood tests with autoimmunity study and chest X-ray, blood cultures, sputum culture, pneumococcal and Legionella spp antigenuria and referral to dermatology and ophthalmology. The haemogram showed neutrophilia 7810 cells/uL with monocytosis 1860/uL, no leukocytosis and no alterations in the red or platelet series. Coagulation showed no alterations. Blood biochemistry only showed an elevation of CRP, reaching values of 48.38 mg/dl. The chest X-ray showed an increase in density in the right parahilar region (not seen in the previous X-ray), suggestive of an alveolar-interstitial infiltrate. Empirical treatment was started with IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h and IV doxycycline 100 mg/12 hours.


Differential diagnosis
We will establish the differential diagnosis of a patient with pulmonary involvement and skin lesions.
- Adverse drug reactions: Toxicoderma or secondary cutaneous drug reactions (CADR) are a group of skin lesions resulting from the administration of systemic drugs and their form of presentation varies from erythema to much more severe reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). This should be considered in the case of our patient, given the history of levofloxacin ingestion prior to the appearance of the lesions.
- Lesions secondary to pneumonia caused by atypical microorganisms (especially M. pneumoniae): Skin manifestations such as erythema multiforme major, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis may be associated with infectious agents, including atypical bacteria, especially M. pneumoniae. In favour of this possible diagnosis are both the clinical and radiological findings suggestive of pneumonia.
- SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN): Both conditions are characterised by severe mucocutaneous lesions characterised by extensive necrosis and damage to the epidermis. They are usually related to the intake of drugs or infectious agents.
- Tuberculosis: Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare condition, whose clinical manifestations vary according to the mode of infection: external inoculation (tuberculosis verrucosa cutis), contiguous dissemination (scrofuloderma, lupus vulgaris, etc.), haematogenous dissemination (lupus vulgaris, tuberculous metastatic abscesses, etc.) or antigenic hypersensitivity (Bazin's erythema). In any case, they are usually chronic lesions and, in the case of acute lesions caused by haematogenous seeding in the context of miliary tuberculosis, they would be accompanied by marked immunosuppression and a miliary pattern on chest X-ray, which was not present in our patient.
- Sweet's syndrome: More frequent in young women. There are often prodromes such as upper respiratory tract symptoms. After a few days, high fever, general malaise and skin lesions (erythematous, irregular-edged, pseudovesicular, well-defined papules and plaques, distributed asymmetrically mainly on the upper limbs, face and neck) appear abruptly. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilia and increased ESR. Pulmonary lesions, however, are very rare, and neutrophilic alveolitis, pleural effusion or airflow obstruction may occur.
- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: Caused by S. aureus of phage group II, type 71 and 55, which produces epidermolytic toxin. It is a typical childhood condition, in which after a localised staphylococcal infection (ENT, respiratory tract), skin scald appears with a positive Nikolski's sign.
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: In this entity we can find pulmonary involvement, specifically lupus pneumonitis, which usually appears at the onset of the disease, manifesting as parahilar alveolar infiltrates, with dyspnoea being the most frequent symptom. It may be associated with cough, haemoptysis and fever, as well as skin involvement which may present as photosensitivity, oral thrush, malar rash and discoid skin lesions. Initially it would fit the diagnosis, however, the skin lesions are slightly different from those typical of lupus. It is more common in women.
- Sarcoidosis: Pulmonary involvement occurs in 90% of cases. Fifty percent are asymptomatic at onset, with bilateral hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and/or parenchymal infiltrates in the upper lobes, with a chronic rather than acute course as in our case. Among the cutaneous manifestations, lupus pernio is the most characteristic, as a symmetrical, chronic and progressive plaque-like induration. Other specific lesions are papular eruptions, plaques, nodules (erythema nodosum) and alopecia, lesions that have nothing to do with the present case.
- ANCA-positive vasculitis: These include Wegener's disease, which usually presents with multiple cavitated pulmonary nodules, ENT lesions and renal involvement, and Churg Strauss vasculitis, associated with atopy, asthma, peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates without cavitation. In these cases the cutaneous involvement is usually in the form of palpable purpura, and the pulmonary manifestations differ from those described in our case.

Evolution
Once on the ward we received the following results:
- Regular laboratory tests with autoimmunity studies (ANAS, ANCAS, RF), thyroid function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: normal.
- Serial blood cultures: negative.
- Sputum culture: negative.
- Pneumococcal and Legionella spp. antigenuria: negative.
- Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Parvovirus, and HIV: IgM positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae; the rest negative.
- Referral to dermatology and ophthalmology. Regarding the dermatological symptoms, the suspected diagnosis (joint between the Infectious Diseases Service and Dermatology) was SJS syndrome, which can present as a complication in the context of infection by M. pneumoniae.
Topical steroid treatment and symptomatic treatment of the lesions was initiated. Treatment of this entity is that of the underlying disease and fluid therapy, because large lesioned areas can cause massive loss of fluids, proteins and electrolyte imbalance. During his admission he required supportive oxygen therapy for the first few days and antibiotic treatment was de-escalated after the arrival of positive serology for M. pneumoniae, maintaining doxycycline monotherapy until 10 days had elapsed. The diagnosis of suspected M. pneumoniae pneumonia was confirmed, with probable SJS secondary to it. The patient had a favourable clinical evolution with improvement in both respiratory and dermatological symptoms, with resolution at discharge of the lesions on the oral and genital mucosa, leaving only minimal residual lesions on the upper and lower limbs. Control laboratory tests showed a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants, and the chest X-ray at discharge showed a resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate in the right middle lobe.

Definitive diagnosis
Mycoplasma pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia (CURB65 0) with associated Stevens-Jonhson syndrome.
