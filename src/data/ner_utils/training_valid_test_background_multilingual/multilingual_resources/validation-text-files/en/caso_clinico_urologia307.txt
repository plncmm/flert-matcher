Anamnesis
In March 2011, a 51-year-old man was referred from his health centre to the Pneumology Department of the hospital due to the finding of a right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. As personal history, the patient had only subclinical hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. He has no surgical or urological history.
The patient presented with a clinical picture of dyspnoea of 5 months' duration, which has progressed to the point where he has been exerting himself lightly. The patient also reported asthenia and anorexia as additional symptoms for the last 2 weeks.

Physical examination
On physical examination, the patient is in good general condition, conscious and oriented in all three spheres. No supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable. Cardiac auscultation is rhythmic, with no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation shows decreased vesicular murmur in the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and depressible on palpation, not painful, no masses or megaliths are palpable. In the lower limbs, the presence of varicose veins in the right lower limb is noteworthy.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities.
- An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed the existence of a solid tumour in the upper pole of the right kidney, about 7 cm in diameter, associated with tumour thrombosis of the right renal vein and thrombosis with dilatation of the inferior vena cava extending to the mouth of the right atrium; abundant ascitic fluid was also observed.
- To refine the study, a computed tomography (CT) scan was requested, confirming the presence of the mass in the upper pole of the right kidney, with venous involvement of the right renal vein and the inferior vena cava up to the entry into the right atrium. In addition, the tumour thrombosis was found to extend to the suprahepatic veins.
- In order to complete the study from the point of view of venous involvement, firstly a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which revealed the presence of a tumour thrombus inside the right atrium, and secondly an MRI confirmed the involvement of the right suprahepatic vein, with both the middle and left suprahepatic veins remaining permeable.

Treatment
With the diagnosis of right renal carcinoma with venous involvement, it was decided to perform radical surgery, which was carried out jointly by the General Surgery, Cardiac Surgery and Urology Departments.
Under general anaesthesia, a transverse laparotomy and a median sternotomy were performed. The already known extensive involvement was confirmed and a congestive liver with a fibrotic appearance, smooth edges and without areas of ischaemia was observed. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed, confirming patency of the middle and left suprahepatic veins. A right nephrectomy was performed with ligation of two arteries in the interaortocaval groove and a wide cavotomy with resection of part of the wall of the cava, requiring a pericardial graft for closure. Subsequently, extracorporeal circulation is performed with cannulation of the superior vena cava and the right femoral vein with arterial return to the ascending aorta artery, followed by a right atriotomy and extraction of the tumour thrombus. Following this manoeuvre, decreased hepatic congestion is observed. There was an incoercible venous haemorrhage in the hepatocaval ligament and retroperitoneum, which is why it was decided to place packing at these levels.
Intraoperatively, the patient presented significant haemodynamic instability related to haemorrhagic shock requiring maximum doses of vasoconstrictors, massive transfusion of blood products and administration of factor VIIr. Forty-eight hours after the first surgery, the surgical revision for depacking is performed.
During the postoperative period, the patient presented a series of complications: acute oligoanuric renal failure, which recovered with serotherapy and high doses of diuretics; lethargy and severe hypotonia secondary to encephalopathy of mixed origin (metabolic and hepatic); complex partial seizures with no alterations in brain radiological studies; severe thrombopenia requiring periodic transfusion of platelets; bacterial peritonitis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae BLEE and Enterococcus spp. treated with antibiotherapy and surgery was rejected due to the patient's general condition; bacteraemia due to Enterococcus faecium; surgical wound dehiscence, after which surgery was also rejected due to the patient's poor clinical condition; cardiorespiratory arrest recovered on postoperative day 27; exitus due to septic shock of abdominal origin on postoperative day 36.
Histopathological study of the surgical specimen yielded a diagnosis of Bellini collecting duct renal carcinoma with invasion of the inferior vena cava (pT3cN0M0).
Three months later, the father of the patient in the case described above was diagnosed with right renal neoplasia with muscle invasion and pulmonary, hepatic and bone metastases. Due to the extensive involvement at the time of diagnosis, it was decided to maintain a palliative attitude and the patient died two months after diagnosis.
The necropsy study showed Bellini collecting duct renal carcinoma infiltrating the perirenal fat, the renal pelvis, the upper third of the ureter, the renal veins and the inferior vena cava, with multiple liver metastases and involvement of 21 of the 35 isolated lymph nodes (pT3bN2M1).
Due to this finding, we decided to study the rest of the family members: in the radiological studies performed on the siblings of the patient in the clinical case (two brothers and a sister), no urological alterations were found. On the other hand, the presence of uterine myomas in the sister of the patient in the clinical case, under gynaecological follow-up, and in the patient's brothers, of piloleiomyomas (diagnosed by biopsy) under dermatological follow-up, drew our attention. These findings put us on the trail of a suspected hereditary-familial syndrome of renal cancer. The first suspicion is that of hereditary leiomyomatosis syndrome and renal cell carcinoma, a disease in which there is a mutation of the fumarate hydratase gene. Currently, the sister of the patient in our clinical case is awaiting the results of the genetic study that would reveal this possible mutation.
