A 71-year-old man was referred to primary care for thrombopenia of 6000 platelets in an analysis carried out after consulting with asthenia, choluria and abdominal pain of six days' evolution, with no other accompanying symptoms. Personal history: resides in Toledo, dyslipidaemic, biological aortic prosthesis since 2012, vitamin B12 deficiency. On treatment with Atorvastatin, Clopidogrel, vitamin B12 and folic acid. No recent trips, no contact with animals, occasional work in his vegetable garden and sporadic risky sexual relations. On physical examination the patient was haemodynamically stable, afebrile, with jaundice and hepatomegaly of two crossings without splenomegaly and a necrotic lesion of one centimetre on the right leg, with no other noteworthy findings. The ED analysis showed haemoglobin 12.5 g/dL, MCV (102.5), platelets 12,000, leukocytes 3000 (neutrophils 1900), biochemistry ALT 340, AST 390, bilirubin 6.6, GGT 103, FA 167. PCR 4.1, HIV rapid test negative, other complementary tests without alterations. Given these alterations, the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for further investigation.
Tests carried out during admission confirmed the alterations observed in the emergency department and the patient's study was extended with a complete analysis in which ALT 510, AST 433, Bilirubin 5.6 (direct Bilirubin 4.6), Ferritin 1433, Haptoglobin < 10, direct and indirect Coombs negative, coeliac disease negative, ANA, ANOEs negative and normal complement, with no other alterations. Peripheral blood smear, anisocytosis hypogranulates less than 3% and normal platelets. Serology for hepatotropic viruses (HAV, HCV negative, serology compatible with HBV passed) HIV, CMV, LUES, EBV, Mycoplasma, Coxiella, Borrelia, Ricketsia negative. Given the suspicion of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, treatment was started with Prednisone 60 mg daily and subsequent gamma globulins without response.
It was decided to extend the study by performing a bone marrow biopsy (prior platelet transfusion), serology for HEV and HDV.
The biopsy showed haemophagocytosis and serology for HEV was positive with positive PCR. Therefore, the final diagnosis was haemophagocytic syndrome secondary to acute Hepatitis E virus infection.
He received treatment with rivabirin for 10 weeks. By the fourth week he had normalised the analytical alterations and was asymptomatic.
