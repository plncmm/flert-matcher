Personal history
A 38-year-old man from Peru who had been living in Spain for five years. Habitual smoker and occasional drinker, he also occasionally consumed other toxic substances by inhalation.
The patient had an HIV infection, diagnosed in his country in 2002, category C3. He had been followed at the Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid until a year earlier, when he moved to Seville and stopped treatment. Until then he had been receiving treatment with emtricitabine, tenofovir and lopinavir/ritonavir, with irregular compliance, and at the last check-up he had a CD4+ cell count of 124 and a CV less than 50 copies/mL. He had been diagnosed with facial and dorsal Kaposi's sarcoma in 2007 and had had several outbreaks of genitoanal herpes.
In 2002 (still in Peru) he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, undergoing treatment for 6-9 months, not knowing the regimen used. In 2007 he had a relapse, being labelled, at this time, as disseminated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with abdominal (lymph nodes and peritoneum), mediastinal and articular (right sternoclavicular joint) localisation. He was treated with prothionamide, PAS and levofloxacin for one year. When he moved to our area, he stopped anti-tuberculosis treatment and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

Present illness
He consulted five months after his arrival in Seville for subacute, persistent and progressive headache, without fever, accompanied by occasional episodes of disconnection from the environment, with immediate recovery.

Physical examination
The patient was in good general condition, well nourished and had no significant palpable adenopathies. There were no alterations in cardiopulmonary auscultation or abdominal examination. There were hypopigmented lesions on the left hemicara and dorsal region, which were interpreted as residual lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. On neurological examination there were no focal deficits and higher functions were preserved.

Complementary examinations
The haemoglobin level was 12.9 g/dL, 6,000 leukocytes/μL, 78% neutrophils, 920 total lymphocytes/μL; 76 CD4+/μL. Biochemistry showed urea 53 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, potassium 5.2 mEq/L, LDH 536 U/L, total cholesterol 205 mg/dL. All other biochemistry parameters were normal. Chest X-ray showed no significant abnormalities. HIV viral load was less than 50 copies; antitoxoplasma IgG serology 1.5 U/L, CSF cryptococcal antigen negative and all blood cultures were negative.
CT and cranial MRI showed a single hypodense lesion in the left parietal region, 3x2 cm, which after injection of IV contrast showed peripheral enhancement and significant mass effect.

Diagnostic test
A stereotactic biopsy of the mass was performed. In the samples obtained in this biopsy, multiple acid-alcohol resistant bacilli were observed, which were subsequently confirmed in culture to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resistant to all first-line antituberculosis drugs.

Clinical judgement
Brain abscess due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Evolution
Empirical treatment with sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine was started on suspicion of cerebral toxoplasmosis, with no response. When the biopsy result was obtained, treatment was restarted with prothionamide, PAS and levofloxacin, which the patient had abandoned months earlier. Despite this, the patient's condition deteriorated, with continuous transgressions in treatment by the patient, requiring multiple admissions for repeated seizures, finally dying in a situation of refractory status epilepticus.
