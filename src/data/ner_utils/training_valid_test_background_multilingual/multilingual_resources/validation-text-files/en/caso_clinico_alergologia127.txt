A 12-year-old girl who, in the context of a dog bite, received amoxicillin which was replaced 72 hours later by amoxicillin-aclavulanic acid (1 dose), presenting after 4 hours with generalised urticaria together with fever peak and odynophagia. No mucosal involvement, no arthralgias or organic symptoms. It was classified as pharyngotonsillitis and it was decided to change to cefuroxime for 3 days and, given that the rash worsened, it was replaced by azithromycin, with the symptoms progressively disappearing in 2 days. During the study of beta-lactam allergy, the initial prick test was negative for minor determinants (MDM, PPL) and antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-ac. Clavulanic acid), so an intradermal test for amoxicillin-ac. Clavulanic acid was performed, which showed an immediate negative response, but an accelerated positive response after 6 hours for amoxicillin-ac. Clavulanic acid with erythema measuring 2.5 x 2 cm. Subsequent CAP for antibiotics was negative (<0.1 kU/L) and intradermal reaction for minor determinants and penicillin were negative, and late reading for amoxicillin was again positive, with erythematous reaction of 3.5 x 2.5 cm that self-limited in 2 days without systemic symptoms.
