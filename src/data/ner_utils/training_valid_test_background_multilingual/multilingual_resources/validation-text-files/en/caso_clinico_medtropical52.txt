A 59-year-old female patient, resident of CÃºpira (Barlovento), Miranda state, was admitted with a perforated nasal septum. She began her illness six months earlier with nasal congestion, redness and a papular lesion at the base of the nose (skin-mucosa transition of the nasal septum), which grew rapidly and ulcerated on the mucosa. The patient excreted yellowish crusts and bloody exudate. She received outpatient treatment locally with systemic beta-lactam antibiotics and topical 'healing' antiseptics. The lesion progressed rapidly and perforated the nasal septum in its lower segment. Epidemiological background: she comes from rural Miranda state and reports permanent contact with insect vectors and their bites. Occupation: household activities and agricultural work. Physical examination: good general condition, HR: 80/min. Weight 76 kg. Height 160 cm. Skin: granulomatous bleeding lesion at the base of the nasal pyramid, erythematous and tegumentary perforation of the nasal septum. Nodes: hard, non-painful and mobile submaxillary adenomegaly. Paraclinical examinations: Hb 13gr/dL Hto 41.8 vol%, 4,600 leukocytes/mm3, 40% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, normal EKG tracing; chest X-ray: elongated and calcified aorta. Leishmanin test 17 mm, indirect fluorescent anti-leishmanin antibodies 1:128 dils, ulcer smear negative for the presence of the parasite. Cardiovascular evaluation did not contraindicate treatment. She was given 4,500 mg/day of meglumine intramuscularly for 10 days of hospitalisation, followed by rest for 10 days and a second series of antimoniate for an additional 10 days, also as an inpatient. The patient was discharged from the outpatient clinic 6 months later due to the disappearance of the infectious and inflammatory process. The nasal septal perforation persisted and she was referred to the Otolaryngology Department for reconstructive surgery.
