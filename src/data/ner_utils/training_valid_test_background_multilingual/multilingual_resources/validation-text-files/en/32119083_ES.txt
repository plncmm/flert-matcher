On 2 February 2020, a 28-year-old woman of 30 weeks' gestation attended an infectious diseases clinic at Suzhou Municipal Hospital in Suzhou, reporting intermittent fever of one week's duration. She reported that she had arrived in Suzhou on 24 January after visiting her family in Wuhan three weeks earlier. Given the patient's history of fever and travel to Wuhan, two pharyngeal swabs were collected and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using the kit recommended by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) and in accordance with WHO guidelines for quantitative RT-PCR. A chest CT scan on 4 February showed subpleural patchy consolidations on the left side and ground-glass opacities on the right side. He was placed in isolation at the same hospital. On 6 February, the results of the second RT-PCR of the patient's sputum for SARS-CoV-2 were positive, so she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in an infectious diseases ward of Suchow University Associated Hospital of Infectious Diseases, the referral hospital centre for COVID-19 in Suzhou. On admission, physical examination showed a temperature of 36.2Â°C, blood pressure of 95/64 mmHg, pulse of 92 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97% with Venturi mask at 5 litres per minute of oxygen. Pulmonary auscultation revealed rhonchi in the left lower lung field. Other laboratory findings were: leucocyte count 10.60*109/L; neutrophil count 9.14*109/L; lymphocyte count 0.86*109/L; serum albumin 24.6 g/L, C-reactive protein 19.6 mg/L, D-dimer 840 ug/L, procalcitonin (PCT) 0.288 ng/ml; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 544 U/L; N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 318 pg/ml. Creatinine and aminotransferase concentrations were within the normal range. A foetal ultrasound showed an intrauterine foetus with normal anatomical features at about 30 weeks' gestation.

As SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it is not known if it is transmitted during delivery or if there is vertical transmission. Several consultations were carried out and it was concluded that, given the current situation (especially the CT scan and the low lymphocyte and serum albumin concentrations), the patient's condition could worsen at any time and she was at risk of preterm delivery, so emergency scenarios were developed for this eventuality. Treatment was started with arbidol (0.2 g i.v. every 8 hours), lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg i.v. every 8 hours), cefoperazone and sulbactam (3.0 g i.v. every 8 hours) and human serum albumin (20 g i.v. every day); dexamethasone and magnesium sulphate were also administered as prophylaxis for the foetus and an emergency caesarean section was prepared. On the morning of the third day of hospitalisation (8 February), a chest CT scan showed multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities, a sign consistent with severe atypical pneumonia. During the afternoon, fetal movement disappeared and no fetal heart rate variability was observed; there was also no improvement with maximal ventilation for four hours.

After several consultations, informed consent was obtained and an emergency caesarean section was performed under epidural anaesthesia, with an estimated haemorrhage of 200 ml, in a negative pressure isolation operating theatre; all staff wore protective equipment, including gown, N 95 mask, eye protection and gloves. The patient gave birth without complications to a 1.83 kg preterm baby boy, with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The infant was kept under observation in the neonatal ICU without contact with his mother after delivery. The newborn was given formula milk instead of breast milk. During delivery, samples of amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord blood, gastric juice and pharyngeal swabs were collected from the infant for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR; all results were negative. On the third day after caesarean section (11 February), RT-PCR testing of the infant's pharyngeal swabs and stool smears were negative. On 15 and 17 February, RT-PCR of pharyngeal swabs from the mother and infant were negative. Three chest CT scans of the mother on 12, 15 and 18 February showed clearance of infiltrates in both lung fields. All health professionals in contact with the child during delivery and subsequent care remained asymptomatic. The patient and her child had an uncomplicated puerperal and neonatal evolution.
