This is a four-year-old male patient, a native and resident of Medell√≠n, who was brought to the clinic for a clinical picture of 15 months of evolution, with the appearance of a brown macule located on the left palm, slow-growing and asymptomatic.
Physical examination revealed a 1.5 x 1.0 cm, light brown, homogeneous, macular oval lesion with well-defined borders. Dermoscopy revealed multiple brown spicules, unrelated to the furrows or ridges, and not following any pattern suggestive of a melanocytic lesion. With clinical suspicion of tinea nigra palmaris, and after having ruled out a melanocytic lesion by physical examination and dermoscopy, treatment was started with adhesive tape repeatedly to mechanically remove the lesion, and 20% urea cream as a keratolytic, with partial improvement due to lack of proper adherence to the treatment. 11 months later, and due to the persistence of the lesion, it was decided to take a sample for fungal study. This was carried out at the Colombian Institute of Tropical Medicine, where the lesion was scraped for direct examination and culture. In the direct examination, 10 % KOH was used and multiple light brown septate hyphae were observed, some of them branched (dichotomous) and with thick walls. It was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar, incubated at room temperature for 30 days and grew a black colony with a smooth creamy appearance, indicative of H. werneckii. 20 % urea cream, applied once daily, was restarted, but still did not achieve the expected improvement of the lesion. Therefore, cyclopiroxolamine cream was formulated and applied at night for four weeks, and complete resolution of the lesion was achieved.
