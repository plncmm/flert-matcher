A 46-year-old woman with a history of migraine consulted in the emergency department for pain in the right buttock together with fever and general malaise, with no apparent infectious source of infection. She reported that three days earlier she had been treated for her headache with two intramuscular treatments (dexketoprofen im + metamizole im) administered on two consecutive days at her primary care centre, always in the same location (supero-external region of the right buttock). In the emergency department she presented with BP 106/69 mm Hg; Fc 109 bpm; T 38oC; conscious and oriented; O2 Sat 94%, with no other findings on physical examination. Antipyretics were prescribed. She persisted with fever, somnolent but without focal symptoms. A cranial CT scan was requested, which was normal, and a lumbar puncture was also normal. Empirical treatment was started with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and dexamethasone on suspicion of CNS infection, which was ruled out after additional tests. Subsequently, the patient presented with BP 50/26 mmHg and treatment was started with vasoactive drugs and antibiotic coverage was extended. On physical re-exploration, during her stay for observation, a nodulated and warm area was noted in the right supero-external quadrant of the buttock, painful on palpation. A CT scan of soft tissues was performed to rule out abscess, where an ill-defined increase in density was observed at the level of the fat in the right buttock region with contact and enlargement of the gluteus maximus muscle compatible with extensive phlegmon. After 24 hours, respiratory deterioration began with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and haemodynamic deterioration. In view of the poor evolution, surgical intervention was decided despite the fact that no collections were seen in the abdominal CT scan. The right buttock area was debrided and necrotic areas were removed for culture (community MRSA was found) and for PA: necrotising fasciitis. Since admission to ICU, she has been treated with daptomycin plus clindamycin, and immunoglobulins were added for treatment of toxic shock, which were suspended due to thrombopenia despite daily transfusions. Anasarca. Haemodiafiltration was started due to ARF. After 12 hours, ARDS began with good response to mechanical ventilation. After extubation, he presented desaturation that did not allow oxygen to be withdrawn until a few days later and spontaneous polyuria began. The final diagnosis was toxic shock secondary to necrotising fasciitis due to community MRSA in a nasal carrier of Staphylococcus aureus with multiorgan failure.
