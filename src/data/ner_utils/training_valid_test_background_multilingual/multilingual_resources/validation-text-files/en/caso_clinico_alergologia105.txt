A 6-year-old atopic girl presented with angioedema after eating prawns and anaphylaxis after eating chicken thigh and pangasius. Tolerates egg, canned tuna and anchovies. No contact with birds.
Prick-positive for cod, hake, sole and megrim and negative for tuna, salmon, anchovy, chicken meat, chicken feathers, canary feathers, egg, prawns.
Prick-prick with raw and cooked prawn, thigh and breast: positive for raw thigh and breast.
Blood test: total IgE 185 kU/L, IgE against extracts: chicken meat 1.15 kU/L, tuna 2.12 kU/L, salmon 1.43 kU/L, cod 0.44 kU/L, hake 0.32 kU/L, anchovy 0.11 kU/L, shrimp 1.26 kU/L, proteins: rGad c 1 (parvalbumin Cod) 0.19 kU/L, rCyp c 1 (parvalbumin Carp) 0.38 kU/L.
Exposure test (PEOC) with shrimp: negative.
PEOC with well-cooked chicken breast: negative, presenting oropharyngeal itching with subsequent ingestion at home.
SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting assay shows sensitisation to panga parvalbumin, and IgE binding in chicken thigh extract in a band of approximately 16 kDa, probably corresponding to a chicken parvalbumin isoform.
Immunoblotting inhibition between pangasius and chicken shows that IgE populations in the patient's serum cross-recognise parvalbumins from these two foods.

Conclusions:
We present a case of allergy to chicken and panga due to sensitisation to parvalbumin, demonstrating cross-reactivity between chicken and panga parvalbumin (chicken-fish syndrome).
