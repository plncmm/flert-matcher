53-year-old male, diabetic on sitagliptin/metformin, active smoker, drinker and cocaine user, who came to the emergency department for febrile symptoms of up to 39oC, of four days' evolution associated with gait instability, diplopia and intense holocranial headache. No other data of interest in the anamnesis by organs and systems.
Physical examination revealed: Ta 38oC; BP 160/102 mmHg; HR 99 bpm. SpO2 94% (Fi02 21%), eupneic, regular general condition. Neurologically, he is conscious and oriented, with facial paralysis of the right Vll pair, dysmetria in the right upper limb and gait with increased base of support with right lateropulsion. Strength and sensitivity preserved in all 4 limbs. No signs of meningeal irritation, non-painful hepatomegaly of 2 cm on abdominal palpation, with the rest of the physical and neurological examination being normal, except for gynaecomastia, bilateral palmar erythema and Dupuytren's contracture between the fourth and fifth fingers. The results of the first tests performed in the emergency department were as follows:
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (13,000mm3) with neutrophilia (N 81%), other series and coagulation normal. Biochemistry: CRP 44 mg/l, glucose: 124mg/dl, normal renal function, LDH, ions and liver function. Chest X-ray (CXR) and cranial computed tomography (CT) without contrast were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed and normal pressure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained with a somewhat cloudy appearance, with a marked increase in protein (239.2mg/dl), glucose consumption (39mg/ml) and the following differential count: red blood cells 18/mm3 and leukocytes 840/mm3 (7% MNP and 93% L). Blood and urine cultures were taken and CSF, ADA, Gram stain and Gram stain for alcohol resistant bacillus (AFB), cultures and PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), tuberculosis (TB) and enterovirus were requested. Initial Gram stain was reported as negative. After starting empirical antibiotic therapy, the patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department with a diagnosis of acute meningitis.

Differential diagnosis
Given a febrile condition with neurological involvement, the differential diagnosis of acute meningitis is considered. The first diagnostic approach is based on the characteristics of the CSF (figure 1), where a predominance of mononuclear cells is observed, a characteristic that differentiates it from meningitis of bacterial aetiology, which usually presents a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells. The importance of this initial classification lies in being able to rule out entities that require specific management of both the patient and their environment, such as meningococcal meningitis. It is recommended to be cautious in the interpretation of CSF and at the slightest doubt start empirical antibiotic treatment, as this is a life-threatening condition and the CSF may alter its characteristics if antibiotics have been administered prior to the puncture or if the puncture has been performed too early.
When mononuclear cells predominate, non-infectious causes such as different autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, neoplasms or drug toxicity can be distinguished in the aetiology; or more frequently, infectious causes, which must always be ruled out. The causative infectious agents most frequently isolated are viruses; in our environment the most frequent are enterovirus, HSV type 2, VZV and Toscana. Other less frequent microorganisms are Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), Treponema pallidum, Brucella and Cryptococcus. Our patient, however, associated clinical manifestations of brainstem involvement, a condition known as rhomboencephalitis, and CSF with high protein and glucose consumption, which ruled out most of the viruses isolated in our environment, with Listeria monocytogenes being perhaps the most frequent aetiology in this scenario. Other less frequent causes include HSV, TB, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, Lyme disease, brucellosis and JC virus. The clinical history and the different exposure patterns of the patient can help us to discriminate some of them at the outset.
- Listeria: as mentioned above, it is the most frequent cause and mainly affects previously healthy middle-aged patients. The clinical course usually begins with a prodrome of non-specific symptoms (headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting and fever lasting several days) followed by progressive brain stem dysfunction: involvement of cranial nerves, paresis, sensory deficit, respiratory failure, impaired consciousness and, occasionally, seizures. The diagnosis of certainty is established by positive CSF or blood cultures.
- TB: usually affects adults, usually as a secondary reactivation in an immunosuppressed situation; less frequently it follows a primary infection. The florid brainstem phase is preceded by a prodromal period of subacute febrile illness lasting 2-3 weeks associated with malaise, asthenia, headache and behavioural changes. About one third of patients have associated miliary TB in which case inspection of the fundus can often reveal choroidal tubercles, a valuable clue to the aetiological diagnosis. Chest X-ray abnormalities may be seen in up to 50% of cases, and generally there is a positive mantoux test, but its negativity does not exclude the aetiology. Staining and culture for AARB is the best diagnostic method, being positive initially in 37% of cases, increasing to 87% if new samples are examined in the following days despite having started tuberculostatic therapy. The determination of ADA helps us to establish the possible diagnosis although the cut-off point is not well established.
- HSV: usually causes a picture of necrotising encephalitis in bilateral and asymmetric temporal lobes, however, on rare occasions it is restricted to the brainstem.
- Toxoplasmosis is the most common opportunistic brain infection in HIV patients. CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually shows nodular, ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions with oedema in the acute phase.
- Lyme disease: it is important to be aware of Lyme disease, although it is more widely distributed along the Cantabrian coast and in north-eastern Spain, as cases have been reported in Andalusia. The initial manifestations are usually self-limiting and sometimes go unnoticed and may even occur without the appearance of the characteristic lesion such as erythema migrans, which appears in only a quarter of patients. We may therefore receive a patient at an early stage of disseminated infection where neurological symptoms may appear as described in our case.
- Cryptococcosis and other fungal infections: these are rare and usually affect immunocompromised patients. In the case of Cryptococcus, clinical, CSF and radiological findings suggest a differential diagnosis with tuberculous meningitis. Definitive diagnosis comes from demonstration of the fungus by India ink stain, antigen or culture.

Evolution
In view of the patient's clinical situation, and following the recommendations of the local empirical antibiotic treatment guide, he was admitted for treatment with linezolid, ceftriaxone and Acyclovir. During his admission, the tests requested in the emergency department were received; PCR for HSV type 1 and 2, enterovirus, VZV and TB, all negative and Acyclovir was discontinued. Serological tests for HCV, HBV, syphilis and HIV were also negative. Subsequently, 48 hours after admission, Microbiology reported the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in the CSF, so treatment was adjusted according to the antibiogram and IV ampicillin was started at high doses, associated with gentamicin, and the rest of the antibiotics were withdrawn. Days later, an ADA of 53.7 U/L was received, although this did not change our therapeutic approach. The study was completed with an MRI scan showing an abscess in the hemiprotuberance and right cerebral peduncles with a mass effect on the right half of the LV ventricle compatible with cerebral abscess. Despite treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin, the patient's neurological deficit continued to progress and his level of consciousness worsened, so he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where he required intubation and management with vasoactive agents due to associated haemodynamic instability. After several weeks in the ICU he stabilised and, despite a difficult extubation, achieved partial recovery of the neurological deficit, maintaining a right facial paralysis, ophthalmoplegia of the 5th cranial nerve and residual right hemiparesis. A follow-up MRI was performed, showing a significant reduction of the lesion at the level of the trunk.

Final diagnosis
Romboencephalitis due to Listeria with associated brain abscess.
