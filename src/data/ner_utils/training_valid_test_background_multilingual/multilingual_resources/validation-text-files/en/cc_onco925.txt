Anamnesis
52-year-old man with a history of paranoid schizophrenia under follow-up by Psychiatry, psoriasis under follow-up by Dermatology, currently not receiving any active treatment. The patient is independent for basic activities of daily living, is unemployed and lives with his father.
In September 2016 he was diagnosed with T2 N1 M1 lung adenocarcinoma (stage IV) due to pleural involvement and carcinomatous lymphangitis, EGFR, ALK and PD-L1 negative, as a result of dyspnoea secondary to a massive left pleural effusion.
On 24-09-16 he started the first line of treatment for metastatic disease according to the cisplatin-pemetrexed scheme, receiving a total of 6 cycles, the last on 07-01-17, with excellent tolerance, achieving a partial response by CT scan and the patient being asymptomatic.
On 28-01-17 he started maintenance treatment with pemetrexed. After the 4th maintenance cycle, the patient remained asymptomatic and in partial response. He received the 6th cycle on 12-05-17.
On 19-05-17 the patient attended an unscheduled consultation because he reported that for the last 3-4 days blackish spots had started to appear on his chest that were very itchy. Otherwise, he reported feeling well, with no constitutional syndrome or any other symptoms.

Physical examination
There are 3 clusters of seborrhoeic keratoses in the intermammary line and on the shoulders. Each of these clusters consists of about 30 lesions between 0.5 and 2 cm in greatest diameter. In addition, there are scratching lesions in these areas. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Complementary tests
Based on these data, we decided to order a complete blood test, which was found to be normal, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which showed progression of the primary tumour and several lymphadenopathies at the subaortic level, the largest measuring 41 cm in the major axis.

Diagnosis
We are dealing with a paraneoplastic skin syndrome known as Leser-Tr√©lat syndrome in a 52-year-old man with progressive stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Treatment
As this is a paraneoplastic syndrome, the treatment is that of the neoplasm, so on 23-05-17 we started a second line of metastatic disease with docetaxel monotherapy, as there were central lesions near large vessels and we decided not to associate nintedanib.
