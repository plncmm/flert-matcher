A 33-year-old woman whose only history is that she has had an intrauterine device (IUD) for four years. The patient presented with two months of pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the lumbosacral region, which worsened with exertion and postural changes, but was unrelated to the different phases of the menstrual cycle. She had associated dyspareunia, intermittent intermenstrual bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge and occasional febrile fever, without ever presenting fever. She had consulted primary care on several occasions for this reason, and several urine tests, a culture of vaginal exudate and a vaginal cytology had been performed without any pathological findings in any of these tests, and two courses of antibiotic treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol and one course of clotrimazole vaginal tablets had been indicated. Finally, the patient came to the emergency department due to persistence of the previously described symptoms and onset of fever.

On physical examination, the patient's general condition was preserved, with haemodynamic and respiratory stability, with only the presence of a fever of 38.3oC standing out on general inspection. The abdomen was soft and depressible, with generalised pain on palpation, which was more intense in the lower abdomen, where there was defence on palpation with no other associated signs of peritonism. Bilateral fist percussion was negative. Vaginal examination revealed pain on cervical mobilisation. The patient had no other significant findings on physical examination.

The complementary tests initially requested were a simple chest and abdominal X-ray, which were unremarkable, a urine elemental analysis in which there were no leukocytes or nitrites and the βHCG was negative, an urgent blood test in which the renal profile, ionogram, hepatobiliary profile, amniogram, amniocentesis and liver and kidney function were negative, hepatobiliary profile, amylase and CPK were normal, highlighting the existence of a CRP of 158 mg/L, leukocytosis of 11.61 x 109 /L at the expense of polymorphonuclear cells, a normocytic normochromic haemoglobin of 11.2 g/L and elevated fribrinogen (6.9 g/L) as an acute phase reactant. Blood cultures and a urine culture were also taken. In view of the findings of the tests described above, an abdominal ultrasound scan was requested, in which there were findings compatible with a 6 cm abscess surrounded by an infammatory plastron in the right iliac fossa, with free fluid at this level and no visible cecal appendix, and the radiologist recommended an abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess the origin of the lesion.

Differential diagnosis
In a young woman carrying an IUD with subacute pain in the lower abdomen, fever or fever and dyspareunia, the possibility of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) should always be considered. This entity requires a broad differential diagnosis that includes urological, digestive and other gynaecological pathologies. Among urological diseases, the most important ones to take into account given their high frequency are urinary tract infections and ureteral colic, although given our patient's symptoms, examination and complementary tests, these seemed unlikely. As for possible causes of digestive origin, appendicitis, complicated diverticular disease, regional enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis should be ruled out, and further tests should be performed to rule out some of these options. It is essential to make a differential diagnosis with other gynaecological pathologies, such as ectopic pregnancy (our patient had a negative βHCG urine test), complicated ovarian cyst, endometriosis, complicated uterine myomas, polyps or gynaecological neoplasms, and it is necessary to perform additional complementary examinations to determine the aetiology of our patient's condition and rule out some of these options.

Evolution
Given the suspicion of pelvic inflammatory disease, vaginal smears were taken (with samples sent for culture and PCR for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium), serology for HIV, HCV, HBV and syphilis was requested, and empirical intravenous antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone 2 g i. v every 24 hours, doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours orally and metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours orally. Abdominal CT with contrast reported findings suggestive of extensive peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis with secondary carcinomatous ascites, together with generalised impaction of the gynaecological structures in the lower pelvis, inflammatory signs in the vagina, markedly heterogeneous uterine cervix and myometrial LOES of doubtful nature, without being able to exclude adnexal contours or tubal inflammatory involvement.
Abdominal c/c CT scan: "findings suggestive of extensive peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis with secondary carcinomatous ascites", together with generalised impaction of the gynaecological structures in the lower pelvis, inflammatory signs in the vagina, markedly heterogeneous uterine cervix and myometrial LOES of dubious nature. CT scan of the abdomen w/c.
Given these findings, the main diagnosis became that of extensive peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis, probably due to the presence of a superimposed inflammatory pelvic disease. After the CT scan, the patient was admitted to gynaecology, where a blood test was requested with profiles and tumour markers (including HE4 and the ROMA index), the IUD was removed, and an endometrial aspirate was performed, an endometrial aspirate was performed and samples were sent for microbiology and pathological anatomy, and a gynaecological ultrasound was performed describing findings compatible with myometritis-EPI (three possible abscesses in the myometrium, a possible abscess in the cervix, possible inflammation of the right tube, left ovary with blurred borders and a moderate amount of ascites). 48 hours after admission, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed to try to clarify the origin of the symptoms by taking samples for pathological anatomy. During the laparoscopy, a possible infiltration of the transverse colon was detected, so it was decided to convert to open laparotomy, in which colon infiltration was ruled out and the existence of thickening of the parietal peritoneum at the level of the right iliac fossa and implants in Douglas, pelvic peritoneum and upper rectum were found. The various implants were biopsied and the laparotomy was closed. The patient had a favourable evolution with antibiotic treatment, becoming afebrile 48 hours after the start of treatment and presenting progressive improvement in her general condition and a decrease in abdominal pain. There was also a progressive decrease in the leukocyte count and acute phase reactants.
The requested laboratory tests showed no notable alterations and the tumour markers were negative, as were the blood cultures, urine culture, culture of vaginal exudate and endometrial aspirate and serology for HIV, HCV, HBV and syphilis. Given the favourable evolution and absence of post-surgical complications, the patient was discharged home after eight days of hospitalisation, awaiting the results of the pathological anatomy of the endometrial aspirate and the surgical biopsies, on the basis of which a therapeutic plan would be decided.
Oral antibiotic treatment was indicated with ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100mg every 12 hours, and the patient was scheduled to visit the infectious diseases department seven days later for follow-up and collection of anatomopathological results. The results showed abundant fibroleukocytic debris with the presence of structures compatible with Actinomyces spp. In view of the diagnosis of pelvic actinomycosis, antibiotic therapy was changed to amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours orally. The patient showed a favourable clinical and radiological evolution, with improvement in abdominal pain until it disappeared, as well as the disappearance of intermenstrual bleeding and the bad odour of vaginal exudate. Three months after the start of targeted antibiotic treatment, a control abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed a significant improvement compared to the previous one, although an increase in the size of the uterus and inflammatory lesions persisted.
C/c abdominal CT scan (after three months of treatment): significant improvement with respect to the previous one, although there was still an increase in the size of the uterus and inflammatory lesions.
The patient has now completed six months of treatment with amoxicillin, is asymptomatic and is awaiting a new control abdominal CT scan to decide on the duration of antibiotherapy. 

Final diagnosis
