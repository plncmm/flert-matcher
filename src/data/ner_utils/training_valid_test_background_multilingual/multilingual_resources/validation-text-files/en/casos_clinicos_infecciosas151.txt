Male, 35 years old, from Mali, resident in Spain for 8 years, agricultural worker. He had no known drug allergies or personal history, except for migraine-type headache. He came to the emergency department for pain in the hypochondrium and left renal fossa of 4 days' evolution, together with occasional nausea and fever, without micturition syndrome or haematuria, for which he had been treated by his primary care physician as acute cystitis.
On examination, the patient was in good general condition, with good hydration of the skin and mucous membranes, afebrile and haemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 123/83 mmHg, heart rate of 64 beats per minute and saturation of 97% without oxygen supply. The abdomen was painful on palpation in the left flank, with a palpable mass in the left hypochondrium and positive left renal percussion.
Laboratory tests showed normochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 11.7 g/dL), normal white blood cells (4400/mm3) with neutrophilia 81.1%, C-reactive protein 31.8 mg/L and a slight increase in creatinine to 1.12 mg/dL with urea 49 mg/dL, with normal liver biochemistry, lactate dehydrogenase and ions. Urine systemic tests showed proteinuria of 300 mg/dl with negative leucocytes, nitrites and blood. Due to persistent pain, an abdominal ultrasound was initially performed, describing a chronic dilatation of the left excretory system with echogenic content inside. With these findings, an abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed a markedly enlarged left kidney (20.4 x 15 x 12 cm maximum cranio-caudal x antero-posterior x transverse axes), which displaced neighbouring structures, with practically no parenchyma, which speaks in favour of chronic dilatation, with extreme dilatation of the entire excretory system (ureterohydronephrosis) and hypoechogenic content inside the kidney, which could suggest pyonephrosis. In addition, calcification of the distal third of both ureters and bladder walls is observed.

Differential diagnosis
Given the abdominal CT findings, a differential diagnosis should include the most common causes of calcification of the bladder walls and ureters, together with hydronephrosis, including genito-urinary tuberculosis, squamous cell carcinoma and schistosomiasis.
Urinary tuberculosis is the third leading cause of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and occurs in 2-20% of people with pulmonary tuberculosis, being more frequent in males and with a mean age at diagnosis of 40 years. In the context of dissemination of the bacilli from a pulmonary focus, they reach the medullary interstitium forming granulomas, which after many years may rupture with excretion of bacilli into the urinary tract, with seeding at the level of the renal pelvis, calyces, ureters and bladder, and formation of ureteral strictures with calcifications and hydronephrosis. Destruction of the papilla may lead to abscess formation. Typical clinical manifestations consist of an insidious onset of a voiding syndrome, together with haematuria (micro or macroscopic), with systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) being rare. The presence of pyuria with negative urine culture is typical. The age of our patient, the country of origin and the presence of ureteral and bladder calcifications with hydronephrosis favour the diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, the lack of a history of previous pulmonary tuberculosis, the lack of voiding syndrome, and the absence of pyuria and haematuria militate against this diagnosis.
Malignant tumours of the bladder and upper urinary tract present at an average age of 70 years. Urothelial (or transitional cell) cancer is the most common malignant tumour of the bladder and upper urinary tract and can be multifocal, due to exposure of the urothelium to potential carcinogens excreted in urine, with smoking being the main epidemiological factor implicated in its occurrence. 2 Other types of tumours are rarer, with epithelial cell cancer being the second most frequent variety affecting the upper urinary tract (8% in developed countries but with a much higher frequency in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic). In addition to S. haematobium infection, its occurrence has been associated with other types of urinary tract or recurrent infections, lithiasis, radiotherapy and tobacco use.2,3 Overall, malignant tumours present with haematuria and lumbar pain due to hydronephrosis following urinary tract obstruction, with micturition syndrome or constitutional symptoms being rare. Calcifications of the urinary tract occur if the tumour is associated with schistosomiasis. Although our patient came from an endemic area for S. haematobium and presented with hydronephrosis pain without micturition or constitutional syndrome, he had no gross or microscopic haematuria, which argues against a diagnosis of urinary tract cancer. Of the five Schistosoma species that cause infections in humans, S haematobium (endemic in Africa and the Middle East) is the one that causes genitourinary disease. In long-term chronic infections (inactive phase of the disease), polyps, calcifications and strictures appear at different levels of the urinary tract, with a urinary sediment where there is usually no haematuria and mild proteinuria.6,7 Urinary tract disorders can be complicated by hydronephrosis and the development of epithelial cell cancer as discussed above. Bacterial superinfection with the development of pyelonephritis is common. 5 The country of origin of our patient, the presence of calcifications in the urinary tract without haematuria, and the development of hydronephrosis make schistosomiasis the most likely cause of the patient's clinical picture.

Evolution
Following the findings of the abdominal CT scan, the patient was admitted for further investigation. He was initially managed with analgesia, bladder catheterisation and third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone). Chest X-ray, smear microscopy and Lowenstein-Jensen sputum and urine culture were requested, as well as infectious serology for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C virus, which were negative. Urine culture, urine parasites and serology for Schistosoma spp. were also negative. The patient remained in hospital due to persistent pain, requiring continuous perfusion analgesia for pain control. Given the suspicion of pyonephrosis, a left percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, with a debit of approximately 700 cc of purulent liquid, and samples were sent for microbiological study, which were negative. After the operation, the patient showed significant clinical improvement, leaving the catheter connected to the bag. A new consultation was made with Urology in order to schedule a nephrectomy and to perform a cystoscopy to obtain a biopsy to confirm the pathology. Urethrocystoscopy was performed and a bladder with granular mucous membranes was observed over its entire surface, and a biopsy was performed. A chronic inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils and rounded structures at the level of the lamina propria compatible with schistosomes was reported. The patient evolved favourably, with good pain control and afebrile, so it was decided to discharge him with follow-up in the Infectious Diseases and Urology departments. On being reviewed in the Infectious Diseases department, treatment was started with praziquantel 1400 mg every 8 hours for 1 day. Finally, the patient underwent nephrectomy.

Final diagnosis
Chronic schistosomiasis of the urinary tract with secondary severe left ureterohydronephrosis.
