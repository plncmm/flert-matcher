Anamnesis
A 6-month-old girl with no previous history of interest came to our clinic with lesions on the right half of the scalp that had developed over a period of 2 days and had progressively increased. The parents had applied a povidone-iodine solution without improvement. He has been febrile for 24 hours and irritable. On questioning the parents, they reported that the mother had had chickenpox in the 34th week of pregnancy, confirmed serologically.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed grouped vesicles on an erythematous base on the right hemicranium and right anterolateral side of the neck, not extending beyond the midline, together with locoregional lymphadenopathy.

Complementary examinations
Emergency laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and the rest of the biochemistry and haemogram were normal. The molecular biology study (PCR) of one of the vesicles showed infection by varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

Diagnosis
Herpes zoster (HZ) at C2 level transmitted by the placental route.

Treatment
Acyclovir 10 mg/kg/8 h in oral suspension, paracetamol 1.2 ml/6 h and topical treatment with mupirocin twice a day for 7 days.

Evolution
The condition resolves progressively in two weeks, passing through the scab stage, which disappears without leaving scars.
