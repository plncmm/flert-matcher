Anamnesis
Pyometra is a rare pathology defined as the presence of purulent material in the uterine cavity secondary to a difficulty in its drainage, which would lead to an increase in the volume of the uterine cavity, thinning of its wall and even rupture of the wall with the purulent material escaping into the abdominal cavity, triggering peritonitis.
We present the case of a 58-year-old female patient with no medical history of interest, independent for basic activities of daily living, who attended the emergency department on several occasions in March 2016 with symptoms of pain in the hypogastrium together with dysuria, tenesmus and pollakiuria. She was treated with antibiotics and bladder catheterisation for urinary retention on both occasions, on an outpatient basis. As there was no improvement, the patient went to the emergency department a third time for the same symptoms that reappeared when the bladder catheter was removed.

"Normonutrition, normo-hydrated, normo-coloured, conscious and oriented in time, space and person. Eupneic.
"AC: rhythmic, no murmurs.
"AP: preserved vesicular murmur, no extra sounds.
"Abdomen: painful on palpation in the hypogastrium, with defence on palpation. No masses or megaliths are palpable.
"Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.
"Neurological: Glasgow 15/15. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Cranial nerves preserved.
No signs of neurological focality. No nuchal rigidity. Assessment by gynaecology is also requested:
"Speculum examination: no visualisation of the cervix or vaginal bleeding.
"Bimanual examination: cervix erased in forced anteversion, right parametrium free, left parametrium appears thickened.

Complementary tests
At the emergency department:
"CBC and basic biochemistry without alterations, except for elevated reactants.
"Urine sediment was not pathological.
"Plain abdominal X-ray: apparent pelvic mass with the rest of the study normal. In view of the findings described above, an abdominal ultrasound scan was requested.
"Abdominal ultrasound scan complemented by abdominopelvic CT scan: free fluid in the abdominal cavity together with a heterogeneous mass that appears to correspond to uterine growth with mural thickening and a cystic/necrotic centre, with a wall thickness of approximately 12 mm, and vascularisation of the wall. It is 100 x 100 x 90 cm in size and displaces adjacent structures, with an anterolateral bladder. Given the patient's age and the presence of ascitic fluid, endometrial neoformative lesion is considered the first option, but other entities cannot be ruled out, and the study should be completed with gynaecological ultrasound and MRI.
"Gynaecological ultrasound: 10 cm uterus, with intracavitary image of mixed echorefringence, about 45 mm in endometrial thickness. Homogeneous myometrium, atrophic appendages, free fluid.
The patient was admitted to the gynaecology ward:
Given the findings previously described, MRI of the pelvis is requested: endometrial neoplasm of 35 mm that sits in the fundus of the uterus, where there is a myometrial discontinuity that is related to the tumour being clearly visible in the sagittal plane. The cervix appears normal. There is also distension of the endometrial cavity due to the presence of fluid which could be haematic. Ascites probably carcinomatous.
A uterine biopsy was performed by hysteroscopy, and the pathological anatomy revealed endocervical epithelium with the presence of a CIN-3 type intraepithelial lesion, with intraglandular extension. Intense and diffuse expression of p16 suggests cervical origin, and the diagnosis was therefore carcinoma of the cervix.
The patient had a tortuous evolution during admission, and a new CT scan was requested for evaluation, which revealed loculated intraperitoneal liquid collections suspected of inflammatory/infectious involvement, and it was decided to perform an ultrasound-guided puncture of the abdominal collection for microbiological, biochemical and anatomopathological study.
Abdominal fluid culture showed the presence of Trichosporon jirovecii.

Diagnosis
Uterine perforation secondary to pyometra was diagnosed as a FIGO stage IIB minimal cervical carcinoma, CT2B CN0 CMX, with peritonitis secondary to evacuation of the infected uterine contents into the abdominal cavity.

Treatment
On suspicion of fluid compatible with infection, exploratory laparotomy was performed with lavage and placement of drains, with improvement in acute phase reactants in the following days, and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotherapy and voriconazole, given the results of the culture of the abdominal fluid.
Once the infectious process was resolved, she was referred to the medical oncology department. Treatment with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy (weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2) was proposed and accepted, followed by gynaecological brachytherapy.

Evolution
The patient presented good tolerance to the treatment, with no significant toxicity. Evaluation of tumour response by CT scan showed complete tumour remission, and persistent distension of the abdominal cavity with hypodense content inside, in relation to known secondary mucometra. To avoid possible future complications, the gynaecological tumour committee decided to perform a total hysterectomy + double adnexectomy + eventroplasty, which was performed without immediate incident.
Three weeks after surgery, the patient came to the gynaecology emergency department complaining of intestinal borborygmus and occasional episodes of pain together with vaginal bleeding. A follow-up CT scan showed a hydro-aerial collection suggestive of post-surgical pelvic abscess, together with significant dilatation of the small intestine with delayed transit suggestive of intestinal occlusion. She has required several interventions due to adhesive syndrome, and is currently hospitalised for adhesiolysis syndrome.
