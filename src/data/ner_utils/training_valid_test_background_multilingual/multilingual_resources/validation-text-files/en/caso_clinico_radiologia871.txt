Patient with fulminant autoimmune hepatitis with right hemiparesis predominantly in the right upper limb of 1 day of evolution. Additional verbal information was obtained after performing a cranial CT scan, the patient also presented fever and intense neutropenia.
A cranial CT scan was performed without/with urgent VSD, showing multiple focal bilateral lesions, hypodense and hypocaptive, in the corticosubcortical junction; without significant mass effect and which could be related to a wide variety of aetiologies: metastasis, multiple infarcts, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, aspergillosis.
Urgent cranial MRI confirmed bilateral and intra-axial expansive nodular lesions, with little perilesional oedema. In ipT2 they showed a peripheral halo of signal loss, characteristic of fungal disease, with peripheral annular restriction and fine annular enhancement in contrast study.
A thoracic CT scan was also performed a few days later, which showed an alveolar infiltrate with adjacent cavitation in LID, with thick and irregular walls, making it necessary to rule out a cavity due to neoplasia, necrotising pneumonia, abscess, aspergilloma, etc. Other findings were atelectasis, right pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.

Final diagnosis: invasive cerebral and pulmonary aspergillosis.
