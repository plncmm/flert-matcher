A 56-year-old man from Rioja who started his illness 18 months ago with nodular and ulcerated lesions on the dorsum of the left wrist, neither painful nor pruritic, associated with an increase in volume. In the following ten days the lesions spread to the left shoulder. For this reason, he went to a local medical centre where a biopsy of the lesions was performed, the result of which was compatible with granulomas, for which he received anti-tuberculosis treatment with schedule 1 for 6 months, with partial improvement. Two months ago, similar lesions appeared on the right arm, starting on the hands and extending proximally. Subsequently, papular lesions appeared on the trunk, which did not produce pruritus or pain. One month prior to admission, she noticed that her right hand was drooping acutely in a pendulous manner. Because of these symptoms she came to our hospital and was admitted.

In his biological functions he reported having lost almost 10 kg in weight in the last two months, and increased sweating associated with a sensation of increased temperature. The patient had been diabetic and hypertensive, poorly controlled for 6 years, on irregular treatment with metformin and losartan. He had poliomyelitis as a child with sequelae of paraparesis and was wheelchair-bound. He had a fracture of the left distal radius 5 years earlier, following a fall from the wheelchair. The patient denied keeping pets, had no sick relatives and denied contact with tuberculosis patients.
He worked in the production of macerated root liquor.

On physical examination, blood pressure was 160/100 and all other vital functions were normal. He was in fair general condition, oedematous and overweight. On the skin, he had a 3-mm erythematous papule on the face, with a crusty surface. On the chest and abdomen he had similar lesions but also some papules with an umbilicated centre (molluscoid papules). 

Disseminated erythematous papules on the anterior thorax, some with superficial crusting and others with central umbilication. The latter are known as molluscous papules.

On the dorsal region of the trunk he had the same papules, in addition, a verrucous-crusted plaque with an erythematous border at the right scapular level.
 
Scattered erythematous papules on the back, at the right scapular level there was a verrucous crusted plaque with erythematous borders, this being the only lesion of this type.
 
On the right hand there was an ulcer with irregular edges, with a crusty surface, on an erythematous base on the back and on the fourth and fifth fingers. On the forearm and arm on the same side, he had some erythematous nodules and ulcers of similar characteristics but smaller in size, which followed a lympho-cutaneous pattern. In addition, there was significant oedema of the whole arm. The examination of the left upper limb was similar. 

Ulcers on the back of both hands and an ulcerated erythematous nodule on the left wrist. These lesions were accompanied by ulcers and nodules of similar characteristics on the upper limbs, suggesting a lymphocutaneous pattern.

In the articular system there was decreased joint range in both wrists, mainly due to the presence of the dermal lesions and oedema. On neurological examination, he was awake, oriented in time, space and person. He had hypotrophy and hypotonia of both lower limbs and a pendulous right hand. The rest of the physical examination was normal.

Laboratory tests showed haemoglobin at 13 g/dl and leucocyte and platelet counts within normal limits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm/h. Serum creatinine, electrolytes and calcium were normal; glucose 228 mg/dl and HbA1C at 10.4%. Liver profile showed TGO 24 U/l, TGP 26 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 175 UI/l, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP) 247 UI/l, total protein at 6 g/dl and albumin 2.6 g/dl; serology for HIV, HTLV1 and hepatitis B and C and serial sputum BK samples were negative.

Chest X-ray showed some calcifications predominantly parahilar, so a chest CT scan was requested. The pulmonary window showed some bullae dependent on the right second lung segment, as well as a "ground-glass" interstitial pattern with bilateral basal predominance.

Anteroposterior chest X-ray showed some parahilar calcified nodules. 

Contrast chest CT scan confirms the presence of these nodules, as well as a ground-glass interstitial pattern at both bases. 

Calcifications were evident in the mediastinal window.

In the radiograph of the hands, on the right hand there was a hypodense area dependent on the distal epiphysis, associated with a disruption of the bony cortex, at the level of the first phalanx of the fifth finger. The fifth metacarpal showed a hyperdense aspect of the cortex. 

Bilateral hand x-ray, the right hand showed signs of osteomyelitis at the level of the first phalanx of the fifth finger and at the fifth metacarpal. The left wrist showed an old impacted fracture at the level of the radius.

On the left wrist, an old impacted fracture of the radius was observed in relation to the patient's history. There was no joint involvement of the wrist on ultrasound. 

Abdominal ultrasound showed liver parenchyma with irregular borders and splenomegaly. Abdominal CT scan corroborated this finding. The patient underwent fibrobronchoscopy and no significant alterations were found. A random transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed and sent for mycobacterial and fungal cultures. Electromyography showed findings compatible with mononeuropathy multiplex. A skin biopsy of one of the hand lesions was performed.

At this point a clinical discussion was held with the specialties of internal medicine, dermatology and infectious diseases.

We were faced with a patient from the Peruvian jungle with a lymphocutaneous syndrome, nodular lymphangitis or sporotrichoid infection, i.e. a primary ulcerated or nodular papular lesion on the skin, painless, extending along a lymphatic pathway, with or without regional adenopathy in a poorly controlled diabetic patient, which would give him a certain degree of immunosuppression. This patient was treated as lympho-cutaneous TB with anti-tuberculosis treatment, which partially improved but reappeared, progressed and spread to the contra lateral limb. This is an interesting case because the patient, having a history of polio, was not moving in the bush, where he could have direct contact for inoculation or aspiration of some fungi from the area. However, the clinical history suggests that the first possibility is an infectious cause of fungal origin.
The leading one in our environment would be infection by Sporothrix schenckii. This fungal disease can have cutaneous and lymphocutaneous involvement, and systemic involvement if the patient has some degree of immunosuppression as in this case. This disease is mainly acquired by direct inoculation either traumatic, through skin wounds and, less frequently, by inhalation of the conidia of this fungus. Some authors report other routes of inoculation such as mosquito bites, cat scratches, reptile bites. Other animals associated with sporotrichosis are rodents (including rats, mice, squirrels), and armadillos. The pathology of this fungus usually shows a mixed granulomatous and pyogenic pattern, which is why it could have been initially confused with TB. Sporotrichosis must be differentiated in our environment from infection by Leishmania spp, in this entity the lesions could resemble and overinfect, its diagnosis in our environment is easy and quick. Other diagnoses to consider are: cutaneous tuberculosis, infection by other mycobacteria (Mycobacterium marinum), some forms of mycetoma, tuberculoid leprosy and, more distant in our country, chromoblastomycosis and tularaemia.

Among the mycobacteria, which is what was initially thought, Mycobacterium marinum infection is usually confined to the skin, and is acquired after trauma to the skin and subsequent contact with fish or contaminated aquatic environments, it is known as fish tank or swimming pool granuloma.

Nocardia spp infection can be divided into pulmonary, systemic or cutaneous. It is the most common cutaneous manifestation of Nocardia brasiiiensis.

Since many diseases manifest this pattern, a biopsy of the lesions and culture of the lesions will ultimately help to determine the origin of the patient's lymphocutaneous syndrome.

Most often the patient has an occupational risk factor or lives in an area endemic for the acquisition of the causative agent. The microbiological agents most frequently involved are: Sporothrix schenckii, the most common agent of chronic lymphocutaneous involvement, a dimorphic fungus of universal distribution and reported endemically in some regions of the Americas and Peru.

Because of the patient's origin, disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis should also be suspected although identification of the parasite by direct testing should be relatively easy and ulcerative lesions are predominant. Cutaneous tuberculosis is uncommon with this presentation, with lymphocutaneous lesions being more common in other mycobacteria such as M. marinum, which is almost always associated with minor injuries in people with exposure to fish (aquarium workers, fishermen).

Another cause to consider in lymphocutaneous lesions is infection by Francisella tularencis although this condition is related to hunting habits or contact with rodents such as hares or rabbits that the patient has not reported and no local cases have been reported.

Finally, endemic fungi such as paracoccidiodomycosis and histoplasmosis can also involve the skin and have pleomorphic lesions; however, in paracoccidiodomycosis mucosal and pulmonary involvement is very frequent in chronic forms and in histoplasmosis the presence of severe immunosuppression is associated with the progressive disseminated form.

EVOLUTION
Cytodiagnosis of the patient's crusted papules was performed, which was quickly reported as a granulomatous suppurative pattern. Two specimens were sent for histopathology, a slough biopsy of the verrucous plaque and a "shave" of the molluscous papules on the trunk. In the skin histopathology of the first fragment it can be seen at lower magnification that beneath a scale-crust there is evidence of epidermal hyperplasia and a dense inflammatory infiltrate encompassing the papillary and reticular dermis. This contains some areas of eosinophilic appearance located just below the epidermis, which at higher magnification show the formation of Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells surrounded by a lymphocytic cuff, compatible with a tuberculoid granuloma.

In the second fragment at lower magnification, a flattening tendency of the epidermis was observed with a dense inflammatory infiltrate below it, covering the entire dermis and associated with extravasation of red blood cells. At higher magnification, granuloma formation is noted under the epidermis and some neutrophils are seen surrounding these granulomas. These findings are described as a neutrophilic granulomatous pattern, in accordance with the cytodiagnostic findings. Special stains were performed, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative for acid-fast bacilli. With PAS staining, asteroid bodies could be observed, which is a finding suggestive of Sporothrix schenckii yeast. The skin biopsy culture was negative for mycobacteria and positive for Sporothrix schenckii. Of note, the culture grew on the sixth day after seeding. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were negative for both mycobacteria and fungi.

FINAL OUTCOME
The patient received amphotericin B 50 mg/d for three weeks, accumulating a dose of 1 100 mg, and on the fifth day of treatment there was a noticeable flattening of the skin lesions. Subsequently, the patient received itraconazole 400 mg/d, showing a favourable evolution. He is currently completing the second month of treatment with itraconazole, where we can note a favourable evolution of the skin lesions on the back, anterior chest and extremities. A new chest CT scan will soon be requested to assess the evolution of pulmonary involvement, which cannot be ruled out despite negative cultures in the samples obtained by fibrobronchoscopy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
Disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis with bone involvement and probable interstitial pulmonary involvement and multiple mononeuropathy.
