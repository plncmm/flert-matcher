A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia.
He consulted the emergency department for an open diaphyseal fracture of the right radius and ulna, after a fall from a ladder. He underwent reduction and osteosynthesis and was given a tetanus vaccination.
Forty-eight hours after discharge from hospital, she began to experience pain in the right forearm and phlyctenas, subsequently developing functional impotence of the limb, neck stiffness, dysphagia and difficulty in opening her mouth. After a new assessment, Compartment Syndrome was found, and urgent surgical treatment was indicated with debridement of the limb, administration of anti-tetanus gamma globulin and IV metronizadol.
Despite treatment, there was clinical progression with muscle spasms, generalised stiffness and dyspnoea, requiring admission to the ICU and ventilatory support with OTI.
During his admission, to control muscle spasms, he required sedation with benzodiazepines (midazolam) and propofol in continuous perfusion, as well as fentanyl as analgesic and neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium and baclofen). Due to autonomic instability (sustained arterial hypertension), he required continuous perfusion of urapidil, in addition to sinus tachycardia (Fc around 120spm).
Analyses: haemoglobin 9.9g/dl; leukocytes 10,000/mm3 (PMN 83%); platelets 223000/mm3; elevated CPK levels (300mg/dl); normal renal profile; abdominal profile with no findings except GGT 150 and CRP 30mg/L.
Clostridium Tetani antibodies were requested, which were indeterminate (0.1 IU/ml), pending a new sample to assess seroconversion. During admission, CPK was elevated with associated anuric renal failure, which required continuous renal replacement therapy and surgical debridement of MSD on 3 occasions. The clinical picture was complicated by septic events (pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation and S. Haemolyticus bacteraemia).
After 72 days of admission to the ICU and having started rehabilitation, the patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward.

Clinical Judgement
Generalised tetanus and compartment syndrome in MSD.
