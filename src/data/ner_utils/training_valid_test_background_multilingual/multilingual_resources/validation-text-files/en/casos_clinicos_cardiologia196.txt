A 42-year-old man from China with no past history of interest, who came to the emergency department with an episode of syncope together with general malaise and dysthermia. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of possible septic shock of respiratory origin with bilateral necrotising pneumonia. Imaging tests showed abscesses in the lung, kidney and liver, as well as a thrombus in the inferior vena cava and in the cavo-auricular junction. An echocardiogram was performed, showing a large multilobulated mass with apparent origin in the Eustachian valve. In the first blood cultures and bronchial aspirate Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Subsequent blood cultures isolated oxacycline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. Subsequently, no new microorganisms were isolated, and the rest of the cultures were sterile. The main diagnostic possibilities were myxoma, vegetation and thrombus. Despite antibiotic and anticoagulant treatment, new abscesses and pulmonary lesions continued to appear and echocardiography showed no changes in the mass, so that, given the suspicion of vegetation with/without associated thrombus, complete surgical resection under extracorporeal circulation was decided upon. In order to carry out the intervention with the greatest possible safety for venous drainage, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral vein (progressing the cannula to the inferior vena cava) and cannulation of the superior vena cava were chosen. A right longitudinal atriotomy and temporary release of the inferior vena cava tourniquet was performed for resection of the pedicle implantation base. The resected mass had a pedicle insertion into the Eustachian valve and was approximately 35 Ã— 10 mm in size. As the Eustachian valve was a large and prominent structure, it was resected. No new abscesses or pulmonary lesions appeared after surgery. The microbiological study was sterile, and the histopathological study of the mass was compatible with fibrino-thrombotic material, so anticoagulant treatment was maintained. At the end of the course of intravenous antibiotherapy, the patient was discharged without sequelae and underwent rehabilitation. After 4 months of follow-up, the patient was in functional class I, the control echocardiogram showed no new intracardiac masses and the imaging tests showed resolving pulmonary lesions without new abscesses.
