Anamnesis
A 53-year-old male patient with a personal history of allergy to penicillin, asthma and arterial hypertension, who consulted for the appearance, after a week of evolution, of a painful tumour of approximately 3 cm on the left ventral-lateral aspect of the penis, with progressive increase in volume and mild associated micturition syndrome. He denies febrile syndrome.

Physical examination
In the middle third of the corpus spongiosum there is an ovoid stony area measuring 3 x 2 cm in diameter. This region is painful on examination, with heat and local erythema. On examination the testicles are of normal size, morphology and consistency.

Additional tests
- The haemogram shows leukocytosis 17.50 x 109/l, neutrophilia 9.78 x 109/l, monocytosis 0.92 x 109/l, eosinophilia 1.96 x 109/l; the rest of the examination was within normal limits.
- Coagulation and biochemistry results were within normal values.
- The urine sediment showed leukocytes of 50-100/field, with the rest of the parameters within normal limits. A culture of urethral exudate was performed: Mycoplasma culture was negative, with a positive culture of multi-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (resistant: penicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline. Sensitive: ceftriaxone). Polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydia trachomatis negative.

Diagnosis
Abscessed paraurethral cyst secondary to Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection.

Treatment
Given the aforementioned findings, it was decided to admit the patient on a scheduled basis for excision-drainage of the lesion described. Surgery was performed and the abscessed paraurethral cyst was excised. During surgery an ovoid tumour was observed in the middle third of the ventral aspect of the penis measuring 3 x 2 cm in diameter, indurated, adhering to the urethra on its posterior aspect. Bladder catheterisation with Foley 14 Ch was performed without incident, with subsequent opening by planes and release-excision of the tumour, with purulent liquid coming out from inside. The integrity of the penile urethra was checked. A fragment of the capsule of the paraurethral cyst was sent as a sample to the pathological anatomy department. Closure was carried out in planes, corpus spongiosum with 3-0 Vicryl loose stitches, and subcutaneous tissue and skin with 3-0 Vicryl rapide loose stitches.
The results of the pathological anatomy of the referred piece showed as anatomopathological diagnosis: compatible with an inflamed paraurethral cyst wall.
In addition, medical treatment was administered with dexketoprofen trometamol 25 mg/12 h for 4 days, and if she was in pain, ofloxacin 200 mg/12 h for 10 days, metronidazole 500 mg/8 h for 10 days. Bladder catheterisation was maintained for 10 days.

Evolution
The patient evolved favourably, tolerated the diet, the surgical wound looked good and remained stable, and it was decided after the first postoperative day to discharge him from hospital and to follow him up in the outpatient clinic. Subsequently, the analytical parameters were normalised and no lesion was observed on physical examination.
