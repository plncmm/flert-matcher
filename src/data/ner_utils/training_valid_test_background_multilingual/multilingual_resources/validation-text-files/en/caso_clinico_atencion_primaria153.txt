Reason for consultation
Patient aged 31 years at the time of the medical consultation who came to his health centre with a three-week history of symptoms consisting of a spot in the vision of the right eye. Associated dyspnoea when walking and climbing stairs. No other clinical manifestations of interest.

Individual approach
Personal history:
-No known drug allergies -No known illnesses -No surgery
No surgical interventions -Smoker of 5 cigarettes a day -No treatment on a regular basis
-No regular treatment

Examination:
-Good general condition, conscious, oriented, normohydrated and normoperfused. Eupneic at rest. No adenopathies or jugular ingurgitation.
ENT examination: pharynx without exudates or purulent plaques. Normal bilateral otoscopy.

Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Vesicular murmur preserved, with expiratory wheezing in both lung fields.
Abdomen: soft, not painful on palpation. No masses or organomegaly. Murphy, Blumberg and Rovsing negative. No defence. Hydro-aerial sounds present.

Lower limbs: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. Symmetrical paedial pulses.

Complementary tests:
-TACAR: medastinal (right paratracheal, in aortopulmonary window and subcarinal) and bilateral hilar adenopathies. Lung parenchyma shows alveolar opacities with air bronchogram, with volume loss and distortion, associated with centrolobulillar micronodular pattern, ground glass and peribronchovascular, septal and cystic nodular thickening. Small and few traction bronchiectasis. No cystic lesions or peripheral pannalisation. There is no pleural effusion. From all this it is concluded that the findings are compatible with stage 2 sarcoidosis (alveolar form).
-Bronchoscopy: after analysis of the three transbronchial biopsies, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.
Chest X-ray: small opacities in both lung bases. Parenchymal tracts and bronchiectasis in both bases, bilateral perihilar location.
-Spirometry: obstructive pattern, with FEV1/FVC ratio of around 63%, FEV1 of 59%, FVC of 93% and DLCO of 63%.
-Analyses: discrete hypercalcaemia and elevated Angiotensin converting enzyme. The rest without alterations.

Family and community approach
The patient has adequate family and social support. She lives close to her relatives, with whom she has a close and solid relationship. In addition, her job allows her to attend her check-ups without any objection, which is an advantage when it comes to monitoring her pathology.
On the other hand, she has total healthcare support (including both the doctors who treat her and the nursing professionals), so that, in the event of any new event in her illness, the patient has them at her entire disposal.

Clinical judgement
-Intermediate uveitis of the right eye.
-Stage 2 sarcoidosis.

Action plan and evolution
The patient started with the clinic at the age of 31 years. She did not suffer from any disease. She smoked 5 cigarettes a day. The symptom for which she consulted was a three-week picture of a spot in her right eye. After examination, she was diagnosed with Pars planitis (intermediate uveitis of unknown aetiology). On ocular examination, visual acuity had not decreased in either eye. Of note, in the posterior pole of the right eye, vitreous Tyndall 2+, mild vitritis, papillary oedema and less dense snow banks at the lower level. Macula without alterations.
Posterior pole of the left eye without alterations.
In addition, in the clinical interview, he reported dyspnoea, both when walking on level ground and when climbing stairs. On auscultation, the only noteworthy feature was the presence of expiratory wheezing, the rest being normal. For this reason, a chest X-ray, CT scan and bronchoscopy were requested, with the aforementioned results.
The study was completed with a blood test, in which the only thing that stood out was the slightly elevated calcaemia, as the rest (including viral serologies and Mantoux) were negative. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were elevated.
Treatment was started with Prednisone 40mg and Omeprazole 20mg, with significant clinical improvement in dyspnoea.
The CT scan was repeated in 2013, showing arthrosarcomatous bronchiectasis, grouped in the upper and middle lung fields. The lymphadenopathies had decreased in both size and number.
With regard to ocular pathology, myodesopsias appeared in the right eye, as well as prepapillary fibrosis in the posterior pole of the eye, with peripheral vitreous condensation and snowballs at the lower level. Currently, the cellular inflammatory reaction has disappeared, despite the persistence of peripheral vitritis.
At the last examination, in January 2018, the patient had stopped smoking and reported no dyspnoea on usual exertion. Pulmonary auscultation is completely normal, with no pathological sounds.
She is on treatment with Prednisone 2.5 mg at breakfast, Metrotexate 2.5 mg (4 tablets per week), Plusvent 25/250 (two inhalations every 12 hours) and folinic acid (one per week).
