Male, 21 years old, single, has been living with a friend for the last few weeks, as he has a three-month restraining order against his family of origin. Primary education, short casual jobs, currently unemployed.

Reason for consultation
Referred from the Jiménez Díaz foundation where he has been admitted for 48 hours with a diagnosis of unspecified psychosis and continuous cannabis abuse. Treatment at discharge: Risperdal 3 mg (1-0-2).

Current illness
He comes to the Drug Dependency Centre accompanied by a friend saying that he has been told that "joints are bad for him". He consumes 7-8 joints/day and 10 days ago, after travelling to Pamplona and running out of money, he stopped consuming hashish and 4 days later he began to think "that people talk badly about me... they wanted to hurt me...", he also describes fleeting, simple auditory hallucinations, auditory hyperaesthesia, affective lability and incongruence and strange hypochondriacal sensations that he experiences with great anguish. All of this led him to leave Pamplona and go to hospital emergency rooms.

Personal somatic history
Of no interest.

Family history
Biological father with probable T. Antisocial personality disorder and multiple substance abuse.

Psychiatric personal history
- Maladaptive behaviour pattern, with problems of integration and acceptance of social norms, as well as oppositional, defiant and even heteroaggressive behaviour since early adolescence. No previous contact with Mental Health.
- Toxicological history: heavy hashish smoker since the age of 16-17 (more than 15 joints/day). Sporadic use of designer drugs and cocaine at the age of 18 and abstinence since the age of 20. No previous attempts at detoxification.

Evolution
When he arrives at the centre he is globally oriented, cooperative, with impoverished but coherent and well-structured speech, psychomotor slowing, poor affective attunement, postural rigidity and hypomimia, all of which are probably of pharmacogenic origin. There are no structured or self-referential delirious symptoms, nor self- or hetero-aggressiveness, which had been present on returning from Pamplona, especially with the family. His main complaint is strange hypochondriacal fears with a delirious character, not permeable to rational explanation and which he describes as "chest pressure that goes up his neck and does not allow him to breathe or reaches his head and he fears that something is happening to his cerebral vasculature". He has been abstinent from cannabis since leaving hospital (THC negative in urine). After 15 days, all symptomatology has disappeared, with only the side effects of neuroleptics and certain overvalued hypochondriacal fears that are no longer delusional. There is no awareness of illness, in terms of psychotic symptoms and cannabis use. All of this leads to poor adherence to psychopharmacological treatment and to the centre where she takes her medication only when she attends her appointments. Due to this, it was decided to gradually withdraw the medication, suspending it in its entirety 3 weeks after the onset of the symptoms and maintaining a follow-up through a socio-occupational reintegration programme, the patient's only interest. At the one-year follow-up, it was found that the patient has not presented psychotic symptoms again, and has resumed cannabis use in doses of one "joint"/day to sleep and sporadically when he is with friends. There is no cognitive impairment. However, there are still difficulties in social adaptation, in accepting limits and authority figures, which cause frequent conflicts.

Clinical judgement
-Mental and behavioural disorders due to cannabis use.
Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder.
-Probable dissocial personality disorder.
