Anamnesis
A 66-year-old man with a history of allergy to acetylsalicylic acid, ex-smoker (pack-year index of 20), hypertension and bronchial asthma treated with bronchodilators and inhaled corticoids.
Diagnosed with duodenal ulcus with eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori. His oncological history began in October 2017 when he was studied for dysphagia and intolerance to solid food intake. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an ulcerated, friable mass at the anthropyloric junction, from which biopsies were taken. The anatomopathological result was diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and the presence of MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 expression, HER-2 positive. The extension study showed three liver lesions, the largest measuring 11 mm, and bone lesions compatible with metastasis, as well as signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis, resulting in a stage IV diagnosis. Treatment was proposed with first-line palliative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, raltitrexed and trastuzumab every 21 days. Twenty-four hours after receiving the first cycle, the patient developed grade 3 emetic symptoms with oral intolerance that did not subside with ondansetron and metoclopramide, for which he was admitted to the emergency department. He was admitted on suspicion of tumour obstruction with secondary aphagia and the Digestive System Department was consulted to consider the placement of a palliative anthropyloric endoprosthesis, and the procedure was performed without incident and the prosthesis was placed normally. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the patient reported sudden onset of epigastric pain radiating towards the right hypochondrium, without nausea, vomiting or alterations in bowel habits or stool characteristics, and remained afebrile at all times.

Physical examination
Performance status 1. Vital signs: hypotensive (93/64 mm Hg), tachycardic, basal oxygen saturation 95%, afebrile. Skin pallor and dryness of skin and mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed a predominantly tricuspid murmur, grade II/VI, and hypoventilation in the lung bases. The abdomen showed signs of non-tension ascites, diffuse pain on palpation with no signs of peritoneal irritation and no palpable organomegaly. There was no oedema in the lower limbs.

Complementary tests
Blood tests showed a marked increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2847 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 274 IU/l, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 235 IU/l, aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) 1,917 IU/l and alanine aminotransferase (GPT) 1,396 IU/l, being previously normal and with normal total bilirubin.
The rest of the laboratory tests showed no findings of interest. An urgent abdominal ultrasound was requested, which revealed the three liver lesions described above, which did not involve the biliary tract, as well as a diffuse increase in echogenicity in relation to liver disease. He presented analytical criteria for acute liver failure and acute hepatitis, so serological tests for hepatotropic viruses and autoimmunity were requested, which were negative.

Diagnosis
After ruling out pharmacological, viral, autoimmune, portal vascular or biliary stasis causes, a diagnosis of suspected hepatic venocclusive disease secondary to oxaliplatin was made.

Treatment
Corticosteroid treatment was started with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg, in addition to supportive measures with serotherapy, diuretics and first-stage analgesia.

Evolution
With the established treatment, the patient reported symptomatic improvement, with good pain control. However, laboratory tests revealed a progressive increase in bilirubin levels with no obstructive cause, reactive to the previous hepatotoxic symptoms, as well as acute renal failure; a renal ultrasound was performed which ruled out an obstructive cause, leading to a diagnosis of multifactorial parenchymal renal failure (prerenal by third space together with bilirubin pigment deposition), for which volume expansion treatment with serum therapy, diuretics and albumin was established.
The patient subsequently presented increased ascites, with great abdominal distension, pain and dyspnoea, and diagnostic paracentesis was performed (cytology was positive for adenocarcinoma cells) and evacuation with an output of 8,500 cc of fluid with a chylous appearance.
To confirm our diagnosis of suspected venocclusive syndrome, a liver biopsy was proposed, but the patient developed a febrile condition with no clear clinical focus. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started with meropenem, subsequently de-escalated to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and contact isolation was prescribed following blood culture growth of BLEE-producing E. coli. Given the deterioration in performance status, a liver biopsy and continuation of active oncological treatment were not considered, and the patient was referred to the Palliative Care unit for supportive care.
