A 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease was admitted to the Hospital e Pronto-Socorro Delphina Rinaldi Abdel Aziz in Manaus, a reference centre for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The patient came from another hospital, where he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR. On admission to an ICU, he underwent orotracheal intubation, received a high dose of vasoactive agents, was haemodynamically unstable and presented with cyanosis and cold extremities. He was administered norepinephrine at 1.41 μg/kg/min and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation on orotracheal cannula suction with high parameters (positive end-expiratory pressure 8/FiO2 60%/respiratory rate 26; volume 360). PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 86.6. He was administered oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) and chloroquine (450 mg twice on the first day) via nasoenteral cannula, azithromycin i.v. (500 mg/day), azithromycin i.v. (500 mg/day), cefixime (500 mg/day) and chloroquine (450 mg/day). (500 mg/day), ceftriaxone i.v. (2 g/day), furosemide (2 g/day) and ceftriaxone i.v. (2 g/day), furosemide i.v. (20 mg three times a day). (20 mg three times daily) and prophylactic subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg/day). No corticosteroids were used.
Laboratory tests showed hyperuremia (360.7 mg/dL) and increased creatinine (8.46 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein (12 mg/L). Potassium and sodium values were normal (5.24 mmol/L and 136.8 mmol/L, respectively). The following results were also obtained: leukocytes 6,530/μL, thrombocytes 285x109/μL, haemoglobinemia 11.2 g/dL, haematocrit 34.5%, neutrophilia (84%) and lymphocytopenia (12.8%). Chest X-rays showed infiltrative and nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe. No CT scan was performed. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. 
On the third day after admission, the patient worsened haemodynamically and developed resistant shock, with irreversible hypotension and bradycardia. He died the following day. Microscopic analysis of lung tissue showed clearly defined Aspergillus structures, including fungal hyphae and spores, as well as a well-defined Aspergillus head with phialides, conidia and spores, and fibrin thrombi plugging an artery and squamous metaplasia.
