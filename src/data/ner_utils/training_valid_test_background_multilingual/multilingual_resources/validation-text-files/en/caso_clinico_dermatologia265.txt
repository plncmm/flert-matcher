Anamnesis
A 52-year-old patient of Paraguayan origin with no past history of interest came to the dermatology clinic for several years with a non-pruritic hyperpigmented lesion on the external region of the left ankle that had been treated with menthol ointment without improvement. The patient describes it as a "haematoma", although he does not remember ever hitting the area. For the last 6 months he has been noticing a similar lesion of a smaller size on the contralateral limb.

Physical examination
There is a large hyperpigmented macule of brownish colour with purplish areas that does not whiten under vitropressure, on the external lateral aspect of the left ankle. On the dorsum of the contralateral foot there was a similar but smaller macule.

Additional tests
Dermatopathological examination of a 4-mm punch biopsy revealed an increase in vascular spaces of irregular morphology lined with flattened endothelial cells, arranged throughout the thickness of the dermis. These vascular spaces were arranged by dissecting the pre-existing collagen fibres and vascular structures. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for D2-40 and the presence of HHV8 virus could be demonstrated by nuclear positivity for LNA-1 in the endothelial cells.
Serology for HIV and hepatotropic viruses was requested and was negative.
In addition, a thoracoabdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed to rule out internal organ involvement, which only revealed renal lithiasis and cholelithiasis, as well as a calcified granuloma in the left lower lung lobe.

Diagnosis
Given the results of the dermatopathological study, which described the lesion as a proliferation of lymphatic endothelial origin and the positivity for HHV8, the diagnosis of classic Kaposi's sarcoma was established.

Treatment
Taking into account the localisation of the lesions and the absence of symptoms, the different therapeutic options were explained, and a wait-and-see approach and close clinical follow-up were finally chosen.

Evolution
After twelve months of follow-up there has been no progression of the clinical picture and the patient continues to be asymptomatic.
