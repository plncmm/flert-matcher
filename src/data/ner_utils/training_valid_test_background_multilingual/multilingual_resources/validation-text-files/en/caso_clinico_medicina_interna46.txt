Present illness
A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department for a weight loss of about 20 kg in the last 2 years, accompanied by an increase in the number of stools (2-3/day), of soft-liquid characteristics, without pathological products or associated abdominal pain. The patient had been diagnosed 6 months previously with lactose intolerance, with a digestive endoscopic study with no relevant findings, and the diarrhoea had continued despite the removal of lactose from the diet.

Personal history
No allergic reactions to drugs. No DM. No dyslipidaemia. No toxic habits. Essential hypertension under pharmacological treatment. Lactose intolerance. Surgical history: appendectomy, tonsillectomy, bilateral phakectomy. Usual treatment: valsartan 80mg+hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg/day; zolpidem 10 mg/day. Baseline situation: main carer for her husband who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Independent for ABVD.

Physical examination
- Weight 59 kg. Height 1.65 m. BMI 21.7.

- Conscious and oriented in the three spheres. General condition preserved. Eupneic at rest and without cyanosis when breathing ambient air. Well coloured and hydrated.
- AP: preserved vesicular murmur.
- AC: rhythmic tones at 72 bpm.
- Abdomen: soft and depressible, not painful, without masses or megaliths.
- MMII: No oedema.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests showed no relevant findings: haemogram, coagulation, renal function, liver biology, lipid and thyroid profile, and tumour markers were normal. Stool culture, stool parasites and serology for HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV and Toxoplasma were negative. ECG: RS at 76 bpm. No alteration in conduction or repolarisation. The determination of immunoglobulins showed a decrease in their level (IgA 20, IgG 328, IgM < 5), with serum electrophoresis confirming this polyclonal decrease. Lymphocyte populations showed a decrease in CD4 and B19 T cells and a reversal of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We are therefore faced with a mixed immunodeficiency (humoral + cellular), the presumed cause of several episodes of urinary and respiratory infection that the patient reported during the directed interrogation. Among the imaging tests performed, the plain chest X-ray and lateral chest X-ray showed no pathological findings. Chest CT, however, showed a mass of heterogeneous density in the anterior mediastinum. The study was completed with a PET CT scan, which showed increased uptake at that point, with no other findings. The imaging diagnosis was thymoma vs. lymphoma. A guided biopsy of the mediastinal mass was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was benign thymoma. After thymectomy, CT and PET-CT scans were repeated and showed no pathological findings. Radiotherapy was not administered given the low stage of the tumour (Masaoka IIB). The patient received treatment with immunoglobulins (Flebogamma 5%, 30 g), initially on a weekly basis, with the period between doses subsequently being increased due to the good clinical evolution, with disappearance of diarrhoea and weight gain, and analytical evolution, reaching and maintaining target IgG levels.
