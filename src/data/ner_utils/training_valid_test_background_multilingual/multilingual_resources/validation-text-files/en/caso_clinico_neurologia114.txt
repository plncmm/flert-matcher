Anamnesis
This is a 55-year-old woman diagnosed 5 months before admission to Neurology with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the endocervix of the intestinal endocervix with signet ring cells, stage T2bN2M0. The extension study ruled out pulmonary and bone metastases and peritoneal dissemination. She underwent surgery with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, leaving an unresectable remnant attached to the left external iliac vein. She subsequently received radiotherapy treatment of 46 Gy, concomitant chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin and subsequent endocavitary brachytherapy implantation. Twenty days after brachytherapy implantation, the patient attended the emergency department for severe pulsating headache in the fronto-occipital region accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain presented progressively and evolved to an intensity of 8/10. It woke her up in the early hours of the morning and increased with the Valsalva manoeuvre. The patient had been treated with a descending dexamethasone regimen since radiotherapy, levofloxacin 500 mg per day for haemorrhagic cystitis secondary to treatment, tapentadol 150 mg per day, omeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours and diazepam 5 mg at night.

Physical examination
Vital signs within normal limits. Afebrile. General examination: general condition, patient affected by pain. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. There was no evidence of active infection.  Neurological examination: good level of consciousness. No nuchal rigidity was observed (negative Kernig and Brudzinski manoeuvres). Pupils were isochoric and normoreactive. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Limb strength, coordination and sensation were normal. Osteotendinous and cutaneous-plantar reflexes were normal. Fundus examination was normal.

Additional tests
- Emergency computed tomography (CT): there was no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or metastatic lesions, nor ventricular dilatation.
- Blood tests: iron-deficiency microcytic anaemia. Mild hypercholesterolemia, mild hypoalbuminaemia. Normal renal, hepatic and ionogram function, including phosphate and magnesium. Normal thyroid function.
- Tumour markers: Ag-Ac Ca125 161.5 IU/ml, elevated compared to the last control (84.6 IU/ml).
- Serology for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster: positive for IgG. Lyme disease serology: negative.
- Lumbar puncture (LP) (in the emergency department): cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow pressure: 40 cm H2O. Leukocytes at the limit of normality (5/mm3). Glucose and proteins within normal range.
- Second LP (6th day): CSF pressure 39 cm H2O.
- Third LP (18th day): CSF pressure 28 cm H2O.
- CSF analysis: leukocytes 5/mm3. Rest normal.
- CSF cultures: negative. VDRL and Lyme disease serologies negative.
- CSF cytology (3): negative for neoplastic cells.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: small focus of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration at the level of the left thalamus, non-specific.
- Spinal MRI: bone changes at sacral level, related to hypogastric radiotherapy, which did not involve spinal cord involvement. The spinal cord and cauda equina roots were of normal morphology and signal intensity and did not show enhancement after intravenous contrast administration.
- Cerebral MRI angiography: no arteriovenous malformations were detected.
- Thoracic-abdominal CT scan: showed no new metastatic involvement.

Following the worsening of the headache and the appearance of hypoacusis and facial paresis, the following tests were carried out:
- Blood test: no new findings. Ag-Ac Ca125 189.1 IU/l.
- Fourth LP: CSF pressure 33 cm H2O. Hyperproteinorrache (73.76 mg/dl) and hypoglycaemia (32 mg/dl).
- CSF cytology: negative.
- Spinal MRI: faint linear enhancement in the anterior margin of the conus medullaris and in the roots of the cauda equina, after gadolinium administration, compatible with tumoural meningeal dissemination. Lumbar spinal MRI with intravenous contrast (gadolinium): linear anterior enhancement at the level of the conus medullaris and cauda equina compatible with meningeal carcinomatosis.

Diagnosis
Meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to uterine adenocarcinoma.

Treatment
Initially, the patient was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension of possible pharmacological origin (corticosteroids and quinolones), for which she received treatment with acetazolamide 250mg every 8 hours, analgesia with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids and antiemetic treatment with metoclopramide and ondansetron. The descending course of corticosteroids was continued and antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin was withdrawn.  

Evolution
After 3 weeks of treatment, intracranial pressure and pain decreased, but the patient began to progressively present facial paresis, hearing loss and decreased visual acuity. Repeat blood and CSF tests and a new spinal MRI were performed, which were found to be compatible with meningeal carcinomatosis. CSF cytology for neoplastic cells was again negative. After diagnosis, the patient was treated with holocranial and lumbosacral radiotherapy, but the response was not good and the patient died 20 days later.
