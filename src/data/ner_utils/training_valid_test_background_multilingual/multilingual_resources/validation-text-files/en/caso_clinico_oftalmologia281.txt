A six-year-old patient came to the ophthalmology clinic for a decrease in visual acuity in the left eye of approximately one month's duration, and ocular redness that was not present at the time of the consultation. The patient had no personal or ophthalmological history of interest. His only epidemiological history of interest was that he liked to play regularly with dogs, cats and other domestic animals, although he did not live with them at home.

Initial ophthalmological examination:

-Visual acuity Right eye (R.E.): 1.0 Left eye (L.E.): 0.1.

-Extrinsic and intrinsic motility: normal in both eyes (A/O).

-Ocular tension: normal A/O.

-Biomicroscopy of the anterior segment: No signs of ocular inflammation A/O.

-Posterior segment biomicroscopy:

OD- Normal.

OI- Vitreous haze 2+. Peripheral granuloma is seen at hour-3, with a small perilesional retinal tear.

From this granuloma a fibrous band emerges up to the optic disc, which tracts the entire retina involved, including the macular area, and causes a heterotopia of the macula, thus establishing the clinical diagnosis of Ocular Toxocariasis.

Blood and urine tests were requested, which were normal, as was the patient's general examination, thus ruling out systemic toxocariasis.

Treatment was with systemic steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (EIA) to control vitreous inflammation and focal laser photocoagulation of the retinal tear.

The results obtained were favourable; the inflammation of the posterior segment disappeared, the tear is treated with good laser effect. There is still minimal residual peripheral granuloma. The patient is followed up by the ophthalmology outpatient clinic every six months.

Histopathology is occasionally performed on biopsy and autopsy specimens, but is not routinely used. Other parasite eggs found in the stool (Ascarisotrichuris) indicate that the child has been exposed to soil contaminated with faeces and support a diagnosis of toxocariasis.
