A 43-year-old male patient from Lima from Caracas, Venezuela; previously diagnosed with HIV, with chronic diarrhoea, CD4 count of 108 cells/mL and viral load greater than 500 000 copies/mL. He had been started on HAART with efavirenz, lamivudine and zidovudine; during treatment he developed a fever of 39Â°C, asthenia, weight loss and persistent diarrhoeal stools. Hospitalised in Venezuela, he initially presented pancytopenia, PPD 0 mm, chest X-ray without relevant findings, and an abdominal CT scan with hepatosplenomegaly with nodular lesions in the spleen. Pathological examination of liver and spleen samples revealed granulomatous hepatitis and chronic granulomatous splenic inflammation. Additionally, the inguinal lymph node biopsy was non-specific (chronic granulomatous inflammation). Fungal and BAAR staining of these samples were negative. Due to this, it was decided to start anti-tuberculosis treatment and amphotericin B E.V. without clinical improvement.

Subsequent imaging studies of the chest (X-ray and CT scan) showed a miliary infiltrate suggestive of miliary TB. Therapy for NIH, PCP, MAC, DVT was added. As, despite this, there was no improvement, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was suspected. A new abdominal CT scan showed hypodense images in the liver and spleen, and a pelvic CT scan revealed a left ischiopubic abscess.

The sample from this abscess was subjected to PCR which was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The first phase of antituberculosis drugs was prolonged and amikacin and ofloxacin were added because of the possibility of MDR TB. The patient subsequently travelled to Lima and was admitted to the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia.

Initial evaluation revealed hepatosplenomegaly without lymphadenopathy, surgical wound (previous biopsy) in the right inguinal region with serous secretion. A new abdominal CT scan showed an enlarged spleen and multiple nodular and hypodense lesions distributed throughout the splenic parenchyma. A TB sensitivity study was performed, which showed it to be sensitive to rifampicin and resistant to isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.

Total splenectomy was performed and anatomopathological studies were positive for BAAR. Treatment was started with levofloxacin, rifampicin, ethionamide, capreomycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Splenic culture was positive for Mycobacterium fortuitum, with positive PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For these reasons, a management plan was established with linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, capreomycin, doxycycline and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; a plan with which the patient progressed favourably. Treatment was completed with pyrazinamide, rifampicin, capreomycin, cycloserine and ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Subsequently, the patient is discharged with a CD4 count of 455 cells/mL.
