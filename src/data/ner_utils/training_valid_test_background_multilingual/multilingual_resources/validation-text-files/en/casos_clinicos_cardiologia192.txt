The patient is a 39-year-old male, 170 cm tall and weighing 65 kg. His history included Hodgkin's lymphoma at 5 years of age which required splenectomy, liver biopsy and mesenteric lymph node biopsy for staging and was treated with radiotherapy to the thorax. At the age of 34, he underwent haemithroidectomy for follicular adenoma.

Previously asymptomatic and leading an active life, he attended the emergency department for 2 days of general malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, lumbar pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and febrile fever. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasound and simple thoracic and lumbar radiology revealed no abnormalities. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was diagnosed with low back pain and discharged. Three days later he was urgently admitted for worsening symptoms with shivering, fever of 40 ̊C and hypotension. Blood tests showed 34.8 × 103 leukocytes/μL (92% neutrophils and 15% white blood cells), platelets 465 × 103/μL, ESR of 40 mm, creatinine 1.55 mg/dL, procalcitonin 6.46 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 20.18 mg/dL. Urine sediment showed bacteriuria, 5-10 leucocytes/field and oxalate crystals. Blood and urine cultures were taken. With suspicion of severe sepsis, rescue fluid therapy was administered and antibiotic treatment with meropenem and linezolid was started.

Two days after admission, the patient presented with dyspnoea at rest and pulmonary oedema, probably related to intravenous fluids, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electrocardiogram showed 2nd degree AV block progressing to complete AV block with output at 70 bpm. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation and a normofunctioning aortic valve, as well as mobile images suggestive of vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet. Dopamine perfusion was started to maintain the heart rate, and antibiotic treatment was modified to include cloxacillin, daptomycin and gentamicin on suspicion of infective endocarditis. The patient's evolution was favourable and allowed extubation 6 days after admission.

Ten days after admission, the patient presented retrosternal pain and signs of sudden onset pericarditis. The echocardiogram showed mild pericardial effusion and progression of endocarditis with vegetations on the anterior mitral leaflet, tricuspid septal leaflet and mitro-aortic junction without significant valvular insufficiencies. Computed tomography angiography showed an aneurysm of probable mycotic origin on the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta as well as a small thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery. The patient was referred for urgent surgery.

After opening the pericardium, the pericardial fluid was bloody in appearance and was sent for culture. Although subjectively appreciated, the aorta, cavae and pulmonary artery appeared to the surgical team to be very small for the size of the patient. A haematoma was noted on the anterior aspect of the aorta and the epicardial fat of the right ventricle. The haematoma was cannulated and then debrided, draining abundant pus followed by active arterial bleeding due to possible rupture of the mycotic aneurysm.

Once the extracorporeal circulation was connected and the aorta clamped, the ascending aorta was opened, revealing abundant atheroma plaques, a small mycotic aneurysm with signs of inflammation and a small, thin, competent aortic valve with a 16 mm Hegar ring. Below the aortic valve, vegetation anchored to the membranous septum was observed and resected. After brushing the septum with povidone iodine, a Teflon reinforced stitch was placed because of suspected communication with the right atrium. The portion of the aortic wall including the mycotic aneurysm was resected and direct closure of the aorta was performed respecting the aortic valve. A right atriotomy was performed, revealing a large vegetation in the commissure between the anterior leaflet and the septal leaflet, probably related to the resected vegetation on the left ventricular side. The vegetation was resected, brushed with Betadine and the commissure was reinforced with a stitch. The interatrial septum was then opened and a large vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet was observed and resected. At the end of the operation, a definitive epicardial pacemaker was implanted over the right ventricle.

Blood and urine cultures were negative. Pericardial fluid culture was positive for S. pneumoniae. Although the culture of the vegetations was negative, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA test was positive for S. pneumoniae in all samples.

The patient's postoperative evolution was initially favourable and the echocardiogram showed normally functioning valves with no residual shunts. However, 3 weeks after surgery the patient suffered progressive deterioration of general condition with fever and hypotension. Several blood cultures were positive for Candida orthopsilosis. Despite antifungal treatment, the patient died of septic shock and multi-organ failure 2 months after surgery. Necropsy showed invasive candidiasis in the liver and lung.
