A 19-year-old male, impaled during the release of heifers at a popular festival, was referred to our department from another health care centre with left orbital trauma caused by a bull's horn after ten hours of evolution.

The initial examination showed an incised wound in the upper orbital rim (puntazo) sutured in the hospital of origin and a penetrating wound (goring) with sharp edges in the left upper eyelid with herniation of the orbital fat. The largest diameter of the entrance orifice measured 1.7 cm and approximately 1.5 cm deep from the orbital rim.

The wound was thoroughly examined and the integrity of the eyeball was checked with normal tonometry and ophthalmoscopy. The wound was thoroughly washed with povidone iodine diluted in saline at a ratio of 1:2. Debridement of the herniated fatty tissue and primary wound closure was performed.

Computed tomography (CT) showed a left orbital roof fracture. A booster dose of diphtheria-tetanus toxoid and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotherapy with ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours and clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours were prescribed. Four days after the trauma, the patient developed palpebral swelling with exudation of the wound, limitation of supraduction and inferior displacement of the eyeball.

Regardless of whether the origin was infectious or inflammatory, exudates from the wound margin were sampled for culture, vancomycin 1 gram IV every 12 hours was added to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and clindamycin was replaced by metronidazole 1 gram IV every 8 hours, because it crosses the blood-brain barrier better, covering the potential risk of intracranial extension of an infection through the fracture of the orbital roof. In addition, systemic corticosteroids were administered in a descending pattern.

The culture showed Staphylococcus epidermidis colonies sensitive to almost all antibiotics tested in the antibiogram, probably constituting a contaminating agent of the sample.

CT scan revealed thickening of the upper rectus muscle and soft tissue in relation to the inflammatory process with displacement of the eyeball.

The picture evolved satisfactorily, presenting 2 months later, visual acuity without unit correction, normal extrinsic and palpebral ocular motility and an ocular pressure of 12 mm Hg.
