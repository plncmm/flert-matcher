We present the case of a 25-year-old male who came to our clinic referred from Internal Medicine for repeated episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia.
His family history includes diabetic grandparents treated with oral antidiabetics and insulin. His personal history includes epilepsy treated with valproic acid and levetiracetam and chronic diarrhoeal syndrome. He had been using cannabis up to one month before the first consultation.
In the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia with capillary glycaemia values below 30 mg/dl, accompanied by trembling and sweating, unrelated to food intake, which subsided after ingestion of carbohydrates. She denies hypoglycaemic drugs and alcohol intake. She has gained 12 kg in weight in recent months.
Physical examination is normal.
She provided a capillary blood glucose record with hypoglycaemia at any time of the day of up to 17 mg/dl as the lowest figure. Early morning fasting blood tests showed venous glycaemia of 30 mg/dl with non-suppressed insulinemia and C-peptide.
In view of the findings, it was decided to admit the patient, carry out a fasting test which after 6 hours confirmed endogenous hyperinsulinism and start a localisation study. Somatostatin receptor whole body scintigraphy, SPECT-CT, CT scan of the chest and abdomen and echoendoscopy were normal. Arteriography was decided after intra-arterial stimulation with calcium, the gastroduodenal artery not being catheterised, and in which an increase in insulinaemia appeared after stimulation of the superior mesenteric and splenic arteries. In the absence of findings in the imaging study, the study was extended with pancreatic MRI, CT angiography and CT with contrast of the abdomen and arteriography was repeated 3 months later with similar results. Subsequently, 18-fluorine PET (DOPA) was performed, which also showed no pathological image. Finally, laparotomy was performed with palpation, intraoperative pancreatic ultrasound and indiocyanine green, and two nodules were resected and analysed by pathologists intraoperatively as non-pathological lymph nodes, and a pancreatic biopsy was performed. Analysis of the biopsy showed pancreatic tissue with a slight increase in size and number of islets, compatible with islet B hyperplasia. No histological signs of malignancy. The patient is currently awaiting corporo-caudal pancreatectomy, with the diagnostic suspicion of non-insulinoma pancreatogenic hypoglycaemia (adult nesidioblastosis); he is treated with diazoxide, with discrete improvement in the number and severity of hypoglycaemias, but with regular tolerance.
