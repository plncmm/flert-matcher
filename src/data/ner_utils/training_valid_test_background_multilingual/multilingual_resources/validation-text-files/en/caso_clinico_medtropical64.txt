A 4-year-old girl, with no past history of interest, consulted for painful left cervical swelling and fever (38oC), of a few hours' evolution. The previous day, after complaining of pain at occipital level, the parents observed a tick on the scalp, which they removed manually. Three days earlier, the girl had been in a rural area in contact with animals.

On physical examination, an erythematous plaque 1 cm in diameter with a central eschar, painful ipsilateral cervical swelling, without rash, was observed over the tick bite area in the left parietoccipital region, and the rest of the examination was normal. Plaque 1 cm in diameter, with central necrotic eschar after tick bite.

CBC and biochemistry were normal, with no elevation of acute phase reactants, and cervical ultrasound showed inflammatory lymphadenopathies, predominantly in the left laterocervical region, not abcessed, the largest measuring 3.2 x 1.2 cm. Cervical ultrasound. Adenopathy measuring 3.2 x 1.2 cm, inflammatory and non-abcessed.

Evolution
Tick-borne lymphadenopathy or TIBOLA (Tick-Borne Lymphadenopathy) was suspected. Treatment was prescribed with oral doxycycline (5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours) in a short 2-day regimen. The patient was afebrile in the first 24 hours, with a progressive decrease in cervical adenitis until asymptomatic. Serology was performed at diagnosis and at 6 weeks for Rickettsia conorii and Borrelia burdorferi (the only serologies available in our area) with negative results.

Among the numerous zoonoses whose vector is the tick, it is important to know the manifestations of those that are more frequent in our country. Among these, tick-borne lymphadenopathy or TIBOLA stands out. This entity is included in the group of diseases known as Spotted Fevers caused by bacteria of the Rickettsia genus (intracellular gram-negative coccobacilli) and transmitted by ticks. The main agent isolated in these cases is Rickettsia slovaca, although other pathogens, such as Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia rioja and other bacteria, have been isolated in patients with the same symptoms. The vectors are ticks of the genus Dermacentor (Dermacentor marginatus in Mediterranean countries and Dermacentor reticularis in Central and Eastern Europe). In recent years, TIBOLA, also known as DEBONEL (Dermacentor-borne necrosis erythema lymphadenopathy) or SENLAT (Scalp eschar with neck lymphadenopathy after a tick bite), has a higher incidence than Mediterranean spotted fever (MBF); rickettsiosis, with which the main differential diagnosis of TIBOLA is established.
