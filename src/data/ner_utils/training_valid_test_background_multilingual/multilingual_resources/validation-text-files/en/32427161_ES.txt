A 14-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, who came to our institution with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting of 3 days' duration, but without respiratory symptoms. The patient's mother reported mild respiratory symptoms 3 weeks earlier, but the patient had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2. On admission (day -2), the patient had fever (38.1°C) and was cardiovascularly stable; he showed no signs of respiratory distress. The abdomen was tense, with defence in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial tests revealed lymphocytopenia (0.14 x 109 cells per L [normal range 1.5-7.6]), significantly increased C-reactive protein (242 mg/L [normal range 0-8]) and sterile pyuria (30 cells). Symptomatic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated for suspected acute appendicitis, and nasopharyngeal swabs were sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing by PCR. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented with dyspnoea, cough and increasing oxygen requirement (8 L/min), requiring continuous positive mechanical ventilation. The patient looked sicker and was less interactive, presented a pale maculopapular rash and boluses were administered because of persistent tachycardia. Chest CT showed typical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. A diagnosis of possible COVID-19 was made. Secondary multi-organ inflammation or cytokine crisis was also diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, lymphocytopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, increased acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein and ferritin), increased serum interleukin-6 (1098 g/mL [normal value < 7]), coagulopathy (D-dimer > 4810 ng/mL [normal value < 500], prothrombin time 16.2 s [normal range 9.8-11.4] and activated partial thromboplastin time 43.4 s [normal range 24.2-30.2]), increased liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 166 IU/L [normal < 37] and alanine aminotransferase 156 IU/L [normal < 40]) and hypertriglyceridaemia (2.3 mmol/L [normal range 0.4-1.4]). The test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin IgG 25.5U/mL [normal range < 20] and anti-β2-glucoprotein IgG 28.8 U/mL [normal range < 20]) were positive, and serum complement values were pathologically low (C3 0.09 g/L [normal range 0.90-1.88], C4 0.12 g/L [normal range 0.18-1.88], C4 0.12 g/L [normal range 0.8-1.5]) and serum complement values were negative.
[normal range 0.18-0.42]). In addition, the patient developed mild polyarticular arthritis of the small joints of the hands. No cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis or mucosal changes suggestive of classic or complete Kawasaki disease were observed. The patient was not eligible for compassionate use of remdesivir, because the SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative. As the patient showed clinical features indicative of a COVID-19-associated cytokine crisis, anti-inflammatory treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) was initiated after a multidisciplinary work-up. Anakinra was started at 4 mg/kg per day (100 mg twice daily) subcutaneously and increased to 8 mg/kg per day (200 mg twice daily) after 36 h, because the patient required inotropic support due to hypotension and an increase in lactate (6 mmol/L). LV borderline systolic failure, enzyme leak (troponin T 45 ng/L), aortic regurgitation and progressive left coronary dilatation were observed; aspirin (2 mg/kg) was started for its antithrombotic effects. Temporally related to anakinra treatment, the patient's respiratory status stabilised and clinical and laboratory values returned to normal, with the exception of coronary dilatation, which persisted at discharge. Anakinra was tapered and withdrawn after 6 days. Subsequently, serological tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (borderline on day 6, positive on day 11). PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 from three nasopharyngeal samples (days 3, 5, and 7) and stool (day 11) were negative.
