We describe a clinical case of a 10-year-old boy who has been seen in the paediatric allergy clinic since the age of 3 years for persistent extrinsic asthma. At 5 years of age he had allergic rhinitis, sensitisation to olive tree pollen and salsola was detected, requiring immunotherapy against both allergens, which was discontinued after 4 years due to good evolution. During her follow-up, she presented several episodes of urticaria and angioedema which were attributed to various foods such as nuts and citrus fruits. Oral provocation against citrus fruits (mandarin) was performed with negative results. At the age of 9 years, after eating an olive offered by his father, who was also eating nuts, he developed urticaria and angioedema. Oral provocation against olives was performed and a diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to olives was made, with symptoms of palatal pruritus, nasal itching, coughing, respiratory difficulty and wheezing that began immediately after eating a quarter of an olive. Skin test against standardised olive extract and prick by prick against olive were negative. Pending completion of the immunoblot study at the present time.
