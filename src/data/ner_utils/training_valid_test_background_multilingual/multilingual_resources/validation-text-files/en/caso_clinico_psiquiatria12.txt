Patient aged 24 years, only child, born in a medium-sized industrial town. No personal or family history of interest. From childhood he was a solitary child, not very expressive, reserved, without excessive activity and with little interest in studies, which he abandoned at the age of 16, shortly after starting to work in construction at his father's insistence, an occupation to which he has always devoted himself, although irregularly, this situation being greatly influenced by his relationship with intoxicants. At the age of 15, he started using different substances, beginning with cannabis and, later, amphetamines, alcohol and cocaine. The few friendships he had at that time came to an end after constant inappropriate behaviour in the context of intoxicants and drug use. He has never had a stable relationship with a partner, which he claims not to be concerned about, nor sexual relations. Ambivalent and distant with his parents and without any contact with the rest of his family. For several years he has mainly consumed cannabis, smoking "all day long". He has suffered two psychiatric admissions during this time, being diagnosed with substance-induced psychotic disorder, subsequently failing to maintain adequate therapeutic follow-up and resuming consumption shortly afterwards. He is currently referred for a new admission due to similar symptoms, with poorly structured speech, delusional ideation of reference, persecution and harm, constant delusional interpretations, megaloniform manifestations and psychotic tension, with no awareness of illness. Very irritated with his parents on arrival, stating that he did not wish to maintain contact with them from then on. With management difficulties at the beginning of the admission in relation to the psychotic symptomatology, the aforementioned symptoms subsided in a few days, appearing critical of all previous approaches, showing himself to be adequate and cooperative. His usual way of functioning also became evident during this admission, interacting very little with other patients or unit staff, remaining in his room for long periods of time, maintaining an affectively distant contact and hardly allowing interventions in relation to issues that he considered personal. He was diagnosed with substance-induced psychotic disorder and schizoid personality disorder, maintaining treatment at hospital discharge with 3 mg of risperidone. Given the symptomatology and the vital difficulties that cannabis consumption had caused in the patient, the need to maintain a dual programme of detoxification, focus and treatment of the basal problems that favoured consumption was discussed with him after discharge, an approach that had not been undertaken in this line until then and which he accepted. He was admitted to a dual pathology unit for a month, and then went on to outpatient treatment. Six months later, the patient has resumed partially supervised work, maintaining abstinence and presenting an "acceptable", albeit poor relationship with his programme partners as well as with his parents.
