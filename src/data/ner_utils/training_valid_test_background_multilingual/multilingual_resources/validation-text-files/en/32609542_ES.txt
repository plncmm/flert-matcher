A 61-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease presented to an emergency department in New York with cough and fever of 4 days' duration. He reported acute hyperthermia and a 4-month history of cough with occasional haemoptotic expectoration. He reported no contact with sick people or recent travel. A chest X-ray showed a dense left basal dense opacity and a bedside ultrasound revealed left pleural effusion with compression atelectasis. Respiratory and contact isolation was established for the patient, taking into account coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and tuberculosis. Initial tests included a pharyngeal swab which was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. A complete blood count revealed lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 935 cells/μL); all other routine laboratory values were within normal limits. Thoracentesis was performed and 1.5 litres of predominantly lymphocytic haemorrhagic pleural fluid was removed. Sputum stained for acid-fast bacilli revealed moderate mycobacterial values, while a Gene-Xpert MT/RIF sputum test confirmed M. tuberculosis. Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine as a potential antiviral against SARS-CoV-2; standard treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for tuberculosis was also started. Initially, the patient required nasal cannula oxygen therapy at 2 litres per minute to maintain normal oxygen saturation. The patient improved clinically: oxygen therapy was no longer required, the acid-fast bacilli test was negative x 3, a new nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR was negative and the patient was discharged to complete anti-tuberculosis treatment.
