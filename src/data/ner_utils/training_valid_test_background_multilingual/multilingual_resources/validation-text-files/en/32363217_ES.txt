The mother was 41 years old and underwent an emergency caesarean section due to severe pre-eclampsia at 38+4 weeks gestation. The pregnancy was achieved by in vitro fertilisation; the mother had a history of hypothyroidism, for which she was receiving treatment.
The newborn was a female infant with low weight for gestational age (2500 g), an Apgar index of 7 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min; resuscitation with oropharyngeal suction was required. He was transferred to the neonatal unit due to immediate respiratory distress, with assisted ventilation by continuous positive mechanical ventilation (CPV) without oxygen administration. Ventilation was withdrawn 2 h after birth and physical examination findings at 9 h were normal. The problems were attributed to stress during the transition to extrauterine life; the patient was taken to her mother.
On day 3 after admission, the mother developed febrile fever and obstetric complications were ruled out. Two days later, the mother showed peak fever and respiratory symptoms; a chest X-ray revealed severe bilateral pneumonia. The mother had no history of travel to areas at risk for coronavirus or contact with infected individuals, although her partner had presented with fever associated with gastroenteritis since the day of caesarean section. After ruling out common viral illnesses, a retrotranscription polymerase chain reaction-retrotranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for coronavirus 2019 was ordered; this test detects two regions of the viral genome. The result was positive. Her partner was then tested and also tested positive.
Up to this point, the child had been asymptomatic while with her mother and had been breastfeeding with mixed feeding. Due to the mother's clinical condition, which required care in a special unit, the daughter was separated from her mother. The newborn was also tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample (day 6 after birth).
Despite the negative result, the infant was kept in isolation in the delivery room by hospital staff until a second sample was obtained 36 h later (nasopharyngeal swab), which was positive (8 days after birth). The newborn was transferred to the neonatal ward without further testing, as she remained asymptomatic. She was closely monitored and on day 9 after birth presented hyperpnoea with mild intercostal retraction and 2 episodes of oxygen desaturation during deep sleep and feeding, which subsided spontaneously. A capillary sample was obtained for blood gas analysis, which revealed a mild transient acidosis (pH 7.27; pCO2 49 mmHg; bicarbonate 22 mEq/L; base excess -4; lactate normal); a chest X-ray detected ground-glass opacities mainly in the right perihilar region; serum C-reactive protein was normal (0.06 mg/dL). After 24 h, symptoms subsided and the patient has remained asymptomatic until now (day 13 after birth), when RT-PCR for COVID-19 was repeated and remains positive. Her mother is in the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation.
