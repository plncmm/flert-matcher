A 28-year-old woman, with no medical history, reported dry cough, nasal congestion, fatigue, myalgias and arthralgias, without fever. She tested positive for coronavirus. As she was feeling well, home confinement was recommended. Four days later he reported diarrhoea, ageusia and anosmia. During the following days he started to feel better, but with persistent dry cough, ageusia and anosmia. For the first four days she took only paracetamol, with no other drugs. Thirteen days after the tests (10 days after the last dose of paracetamol), the patient began to notice pruritic lesions on both heels; at the same time, she noticed yellowish erythematous papules on both heels, with no other skin lesions. She stated that she was not wearing tight socks or shoes or any other local pressure that could explain the distribution of the lesions. Local treatment with corticosteroids was recommended. Despite treatment, three days later, the lesions persisted and developed into hardened, pruritic, erythematous plaques. At that time, urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, idiopathic plantar hydrosadenitis and neutrophilic dermatosis were considered in the differential diagnosis. However, no biopsy was performed.
