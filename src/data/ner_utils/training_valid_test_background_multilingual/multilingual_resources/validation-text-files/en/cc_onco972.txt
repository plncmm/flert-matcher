Oncological history
I present the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian woman, bank manager by profession, with two sisters, married, living with her husband, and with a daughter in common, independent for activities of daily living.
She has no known allergies or toxic habits. She has hypertension and is treated with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg. She does not take any other chronic medication except for occasional paracetamol if required due to pain. She underwent surgery more than 20 years ago for a multinodular goitre. She has no other pathological history of interest.
Her father was diagnosed with gastric cancer at the age of 66 and her mother with endometrial cancer at the age of 48.
The patient debuted in June 2013 at the age of 65 years with a lesion in the right upper outer quadrant of the right breast as a chance finding on routine mammography, initiating an ultrasound and core needle biopsy (CNB) of 2 foci of 17 and 20 mm, compatible with ductal ductal carcinoma, compatible with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) grade 3, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), Ki67 30% in one focus and 10% in the other. Tumour markers at diagnosis were CEA 67.2 and Ca 15-3 108.7. An extension study was performed, with various tests, notably PET/CT, with multiple blast bone metastases at D7, D9, transverse process of L4, S1, right iliac bone and right femoral head.
With the diagnosis of hormone receptor-positive and HER-2 positive stage IV breast IDC due to bone metastases, the patient started first-line chemotherapy treatment within the PERUSE clinical trial with paclitaxel, pertuzumab and trastuzumab in October 2013, with adequate tolerance. The patient also received radiotherapy on the iliac bone metastases and right femoral head (30 Gy each) in November 2013, despite which she presented with pathological right hip fracture in December 2013 which was treated by cemented partial arthroplasty. He received 6 cycles until February 2014, achieving partial response, after which paclitaxel was suspended and letrozole, pertuzumab and trastuzumab were continued until October 2014, ending due to bone progression in the rib and left femur.
Given the radiological bone progression, the patient started a second line of treatment with TDM1 3.6 mg/kg every 21 days, which she has maintained to date.

Anamnesis
The patient sought a second opinion at the Medical Oncology outpatient clinic on 29 July 2016 due to a predominantly afternoon fever associated with pain in the dorsal-lumbar spine radiating to the right hip, which has been progressively increasing, with no loss of function, over a month and a half of evolution.
In the interview, she referred to 2 previous admissions to different hospitals. One of them, from 30 May to 6 June, she was diagnosed with a Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) reservoir infection, treated with vancomycin and withdrawn and discharged with ciprofloxacin for 4 days. Due to persistent fever, she consulted another hospital on 11 June and was prescribed cefixime for 7 days.
Given the clinical suspicion of OV, it was decided to order blood tests, blood cultures (HC) and urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed fractures in D9 and D10 with abundant oedema in both vertebral bodies and in the intervertebral disc, as well as bulging of the posterior wall of D9 towards the subarachnoid space and bone bridges. Given the seriousness of the situation, on 8 August 2016 it was decided to admit him for the start of empirical intravenous antibiotherapy and to complete the study.

Physical examination
On arrival at the hospital ward, she was haemodynamically stable and afebrile, with a physical examination with no findings except selective pain on palpation of D9 and D10.

Complementary tests
The admission blood tests showed normal renal and hepatic function, with an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) to 98.6 mg/l (normal: less than 1 mg/l) with normal procalcitonin (PCT) (0.05 ng/ml). The haemogram showed normocytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl, already known, with leukocyte and platelet values in the normal range, with leukocytes of 8,910 (normal values between 4,500 and 11,000). During his admission, the results of the HC were pending.
In addition to the aforementioned MRI, a chest X-ray was also performed, which showed no alterations of interest, as well as a Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks and a transthoracic ultrasound, aimed at screening for endocarditis, with no pathological findings.

Diagnosis
The patient was diagnosed with vertebral osteomyelitis D9-D10 due to Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Treatment
Based on clinical and imaging data, empirical treatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was initiated based on previous SE isolates. Serial BC performed at our centre confirmed the positivity of this microorganism, oxacillin-resistant, and vancomycin was maintained for 15 days, with improvement in symptoms and acute phase reactants, with a decrease in CRP to 31.7 mg/l in the analysis at discharge, subsequently continuing with oral cotrimoxazole for a further 4 weeks.

Evolution
On 13 November 2016, the patient consulted for new febrile peaks of up to 38.5oC, for which reason a new MRI was performed, which showed findings suggestive of persistent OV, and it was decided to perform a surgical biopsy in January 2017, with isolation of SE with the same sensitivity pattern, and biopsy compatible with chronic inflammatory process in evolution, with oral ciprofloxacin being prescribed, and she continues to be followed up for this reason.
