Anamnesis
A 72-year-old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism and anxious-depressive syndrome came to the Emergency Department, referred from another hospital, for assessment of painful skin lesions of five days' evolution associated with a dystrophic sensation and general malaise. Twenty-four hours earlier, she had started empirical intravenous antibiotherapy with Ceftriaxone 2 grams every 24 hours and Clindamycin 600 milligrams every 8 hours.

Physical examination
The patient was febrile, with a temperature of 37.8 oC and haemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 143/63 mmHg and heart rate of 73 beats per minute. He presented an erythematous plaque, slightly infiltrated, with vesicles and tense blisters of serous content on the surface, occupying the entire right auricle and external auditory canal, the right mandibular arch and the right lateral cervical region. On the trunk, upper limbs and root of the lower limbs there were erythematous papules with a central vesicle numbering more than 100.
In the neurological examination, the deviation of the labial commissure with the smile to the left and a discreet inability to completely close the right upper eyelid were noteworthy.

Additional tests
The haemogram showed an absence of leukocytosis, mild lymphopenia and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes. The basic biochemistry showed a slight increase in creatinine not present in previous studies, a slight hypertransaminasemia, with a greater increase in GOT than GPT, and a slight decrease in total protein.
Microbiological examination of the fluid from the vesicles revealed a positive PCR for herpes zoster. Blood cultures were negative.

Diagnosis
Multimetastatic herpes zoster, with involvement of right C2 and C3 dermatomes, and disseminated with associated peripheral facial palsy (Ramsay-Hunt syndrome) in a patient with chronic enolism, enolic liver disease and evidence of malnutrition.

Treatment
Intravenous treatment with acyclovir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/8 hours was administered for 10 days and associated with serotherapy, analgesic treatment and systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day in a descending pattern. Daily local dressings with 1/1000 copper sulphate fomentation were prescribed.

Evolution
The patient improved clinically with disappearance of fever and decrease in pain 24-48 hours after the start of treatment. The lesions gradually improved, leaving only residual lesions 15 days later. Mild facial paralysis persisted. In search of possible neoplasms or other immunosuppressive diseases that could have triggered the symptoms, a CT scan of the whole body was performed and no masses or lymph nodes of significant size were found. HIV serologies were negative.
