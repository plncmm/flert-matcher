A 64-year-old patient attended the emergency department for the appearance of an epigastric eventration 2 months ago, which currently presents redness and purulent discharge from the area. He had no fever, abdominal pain or other accompanying symptoms. The patient had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy 1 year earlier.

An abdominopelvic CT scan was performed after administration of civ, in which the following findings were described: a 7 x 3.7 cm collection in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the epigastric region, left parasagittal, showing an irregular fistulous trajectory towards the peritoneal cavity where a small intraluminal gas bubble is observed. There are no intra-abdominal collections at the present time. The presence of three heterogeneous lesions in close relation to the hepatic surface, the largest of 3.8 cm (medial to the caudate, anterior to the IVC), non-specific. Complementary MRI could be performed to better define its nature. Adjacent to the larger lesion there are small adenopathies. The MRI lesions showed similar findings to those of the CT scan, with marked restriction of diffusion, so FNA was performed by echoendoscopy of the lesion in the portocaval space, with findings compatible with acute abscessed inflammation superinfected by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In view of these findings, a re-evaluation CT scan was performed, in which the diagnosis of lithogenic abscesses secondary to cholecystectomy was proposed, as the collections also showed a hyperdense image in the interior suggestive of lithogenic content.
