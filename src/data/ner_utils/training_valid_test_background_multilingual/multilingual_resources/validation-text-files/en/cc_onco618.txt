Anamnesis
This is a 43-year-old male patient with a pathological history of a germinal tumour operated on and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy > 20 years ago and hepatitis B in 2015. The patient consulted the emergency department for anal pain, a tendency to constipation and haematochezia of 3 weeks' evolution.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed the presence of a tumour 4 cm from the anal margin on rectal examination.

Complementary tests
With suspicion of rectal neoplasia, the study was completed with colonoscopy, which revealed an exophytic, ulcerated, proliferative lesion suggestive of rectal neoplasia, non-stenosing.
The CT scan showed the presence of a tumour-like thickening in the walls of the middle third of the rectum with signs of fat infiltration and multiple perirectal adenopathies, as well as retroperitoneal adenopathies. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the rectal parietal thickening associated with locoregional adenopathic involvement.
Histological examination of the biopsy of the rectal mass showed no malignant cells, with a distorted colic mucosa and an increased chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry studies for cytomegalovirus and treponema were performed and both were negative.
On suspicion of infectious aetiology, a urethral and rectal smear was performed, with positive nucleic acid detection for Chlamydia trachomatis.

Diagnosis
It was concluded that it was a lymphogranuloma venereum of rectal presentation caused by C. trachomatis.
During the work-up, a blood test showed grade 4 transaminitis (AST 2497U/l - upper limit of normal 37U/l) and grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 106 μmol/l - upper limit of normal 17 μmol/l). Serology was performed, with positive IgM for hepatitis A virus (negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and syphilis), suggesting a primary hepatitis A infection concomitant with lymphogranuloma venereum.

Treatment
Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline (100 mg every 12 hours) was started for a total of 3 weeks.

Evolution
Subsequent check-ups showed progressive normalisation of the liver profile and disappearance of the anal symptoms. In the control colonoscopy 3 months after treatment, an improvement in the degree of inflammation was observed.
