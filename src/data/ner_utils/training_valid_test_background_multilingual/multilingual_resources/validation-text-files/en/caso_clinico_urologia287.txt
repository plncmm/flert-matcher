Anamnesis
We present the case of a 78-year-old man with the following personal history: arterial hypertension; tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome; ischaemic heart disease; chronic hepatopathy due to C virus; moderate chronic renal insufficiency with basal creatinine around 1.46 mg/dl; Gleason 7 prostate adenocarcinoma treated with radiotherapy with 76 Gy in June 2006.
During follow-up for his liver disease, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast performed on 30/12/2009 revealed a left renal mass of 4 cm in diameter, suggestive of a renal tumour.

Physical examination
Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths palpable. The rest of the physical examination was normal.

Complementary tests
- Abdominal-pelvic CT scan: a solid interpolar lesion of the left kidney was observed, compatible with a neoformation as a first possibility, 4 cm in diameter. There were also non-specific hepatic space-occupying lesions.

Treatment
First surgical procedure: a partial left nephrectomy was performed on 10/2/2010 using a lumbotomy approach. Pathological diagnosis: clear cell renal carcinoma 4 x 2.5 x 3 cm, Fuhrman grade IV, infiltrating the capsule and the perirenal adipose tissue and extensively affecting the surgical edge (pathological stage pT3a Nx).
Second surgical procedure: in view of the poor histological profile of the specimen and positive wide surgical margins, it was decided to complete the nephrectomy on 10/5/2010.
Pathological diagnosis: no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Post nephrectomy inflammatory and reactive changes.

Evolution
The abdominal-pelvic CT scan of 27/6/2011 showed a solid mass of ill-defined contours in the left lumbar abdominal wall, with fat trabeculation and pseudonodular images adjacent to the nephrectomy cell, progressing towards the subcutaneous tissue, with a major axis of 6 cm. On 8/7/2011 a biopsy of the mass was performed, confirming in the histopathological study tumour cells compatible with recurrence of clear cell carcinoma.
Third surgical procedure: on 5/9/2011, excision of the local recurrence was performed by lumbotomy approach.
Pathological diagnosis: 11 x 8 cm mass infiltrated by clear cell carcinoma.
Current status: the last CT scan performed on 8/0/2012 shows no signs of local recurrence or distant disease. His last creatinine level is 2.56 mg/dl.
