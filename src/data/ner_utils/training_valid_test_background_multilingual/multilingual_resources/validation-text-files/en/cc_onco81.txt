Anamnesis
71-year-old patient with no drug allergies, personal history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysematous type, left pneumothorax in 1994 secondary to ruptured bullae that required pleurodesis, prostate adenoma and arterial hypertension on treatment with beta-blockers. The clinical onset began in May 2009 when he developed dyspnoea on moderate exertion for 48 hours and haemoptotic sputum.

Physical examination
There was a decrease in vesicular murmur in the right upper lobe, with associated isolated rhonchi; no palpable lymphadenopathy or megaliths. The rest of the examination was normal.

Complementary tests
"An initial chest X-ray was requested, showing a right paratracheal mass.
"The computed tomography (CT) scan of May 2009 showed a lung tumour in the right upper lobe (LSD) measuring 88 mm with mediastinal infiltration of the upper lobe pulmonary artery and mediastinal adenopathy anterior to the right main bronchus measuring 20 mm, confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET).
"The study was completed with a fine needle biopsy, with an anatomopathological result of lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR non-mutated.

Diagnosis
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary pulmonary pathology committee, and with the clinical judgement of lung adenocarcinoma cT4 N2 M0, stage IIIB, radiotherapy (RT) was decided concomitant with chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intent, in order to subsequently evaluate the possibility of surgery.

Treatment
Preplanning was performed but the volume 20 of 43%, the pattern of bilateral centrolobulillar emphysema, as well as the loss of volume in the left hemithorax with mediastinal retraction made it inadvisable to start RT. The patient started induction chemotherapy with carboplatin-gemcitabine and was evaluated after three cycles in July 2009 for partial radiological response in the lung and lymph nodes. The lesion in the right upper lobe has decreased from 88 to 47 mm and the right mediastinal adenopathy has decreased from 20 to 14 mm.

The case was reviewed by the tumour committee and surgical treatment was rejected as the lung diffusion scintigraphy showed a heterogeneous distribution with a right lung function of 41% and a left lung function of 59%. Preplanning was repeated, with a V20 of 28%, and weekly chemotherapy was decided with carboplatin-paclitaxel concomitant with radiotherapy using five 6 Mev photon fields formed with a collimator at a rate of 2 Gy/day, 5 days a week up to 60 Gy over the lung and mediastinal lesion. Tolerance was good, with grade 2 oesophagitis and grade 1 dermitis. At the end of treatment in October 2009, he showed a partial radiological response, with a decrease of 47 to 35 mm in the lesion in the right lung lobe and 14 to 9 mm in the right mediastinal adenopathy.

Evolution
After a progression-free interval of 30 months, an 11 mm pulmonary nodule in the LSD was observed in the control CT scan of April 2012. The case was discussed again within the multidisciplinary committee, and it was considered that it could be treated with pulmonary radiofrequency thermoablation with a Le Veen electrode with a maximum opening of 25 mm, and remission was observed after the procedure.

After a second progression-free interval of 8 months, in December 2012 there was evidence of progression in the anterior wall of the nodule previously treated with radiofrequency, with a maximum diameter of 16 mm. The case was presented to the tumour committee and a second thermoablation of the nodule was proposed in the LSD over the cavitation area with a Le Veen electrode with a maximum opening of 30 mm in diameter in two sessions by progressive withdrawal of the electrode, producing a pneumothorax, which was drained. In March 2014, one year and three months after the procedure, a radiological control was carried out by contrast-enhanced thoracic CT, which showed no signs of progression. The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukaemia associated with bilateral Candida krusei pneumonia and global respiratory failure, and was discharged on 2/4/2015.
