A 42-year-old male patient from Romania who has been living in Spain for 10 years. He works in construction, and for this reason has been living in Equatorial Guinea for the last year, travelling to Spain every six months. His background includes smoking 20 cigarettes/day and drinking about 20 grams of ethanol per day. He was also vaccinated for tuberculosis as a child.

During his stay in Africa he remained practically asymptomatic except for an episode of malaria diagnosed and treated on an outpatient basis (he did not take chemoprophylaxis against this disease). He had not had contact with animals, drank unbottled water, consumed local dairy products or bathed in fresh water.

After a year, she returned to Spain for the second time, and after staying in our country for seven days, she travelled to Romania to visit her relatives. A week after arriving in her country of origin, she began to suffer from flu-like symptoms consisting of fever and arthromyalgia, a barely productive cough without purulent expectoration, pleuritic chest pain in the right hemithorax, night sweats, asthenia and a loss of about 5 kilograms (kg) in weight.

After a month in Romania, he returned to Spain. On arrival, she consulted primary care due to persistent symptoms. She was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for seven days, but due to the lack of improvement she came to our hospital. Physical examination revealed an asthenic, eupneic habitus, with axillary temperature of 39oC, blood pressure of 93/60 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm and baseline oxygen saturation of 97%. Weight: 55 kg. Oropharyngeal thrush was present and no peripheral lymphadenopathy was palpable. Cardiac auscultation was normal, but respiratory auscultation showed decreased vesicular murmur in both lung bases with moist crackles in the right base. The abdomen was soft to palpation, non-painful, with slight hepatomegaly with a smooth border, without masses or signs of peritoneal irritation. The lower limbs had no oedema or evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The neurological examination was normal.

Initial complementary tests were as follows:
- Haemoglobin 6.9 mg/dL, Haematocrit 21.3%, MCV 92.8 fl, HCV 30.2 pg, Platelets 112,000/mm3, Leukocytes 4,770/mm3 (Neutrophils 56.3%, Lymphocytes 22.9%, Eosinophils 0.9%).
- Biochemistry: Glucemia 58 mg/dL, Creatinine 0.45 mg/dL, Sodium 135 meq/L, Potassium 4 meq/L, Urea 28 mg/dL, ALT 10 IU/L, AST 20 IU/L, LDH 274 IU/L, C Reactive Protein 18.53 mg/dL.
- Coagulation: normal.
- Chest X-ray: right upper lobe infiltrate with associated atelectasis.
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, with normal axis and without conduction disturbances or ventricular repolarisation.

Differential diagnosis
In summary, the patient consulted for febrile syndrome, arthromyalgia and deterioration of the general state of one month of evolution, with associated respiratory infectious symptoms. Complementary laboratory tests showed anaemia, thrombopenia and hypoglycaemia, as well as a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The anamnesis highlighted the epidemiological history of his return to Spain after a long stay in Equatorial Guinea 6 weeks earlier and the fact that he had not taken antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. The initial differential diagnosis should focus on febrile syndrome in a patient from a tropical area, paying special attention to those aetiologies causing pulmonary involvement.

The most important disease to rule out in travellers with fever on return from the tropics is malaria1 , especially if the patient comes from an endemic area such as sub-Saharan Africa. In some series, malaria accounts for up to 30% of febrile illnesses in travellers from this region of the world. Often, patients also present with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, micturition or respiratory symptoms, in the latter case, simulating lower respiratory tract infections. Severe malaria may present with pulmonary infiltrates due to both the disease itself and bacterial superinfection (complicated malaria). Haematological manifestations are frequent, with anaemia in 41% of cases and thrombopenia in 62-83%. Hypoglycaemia (defined as blood glucose below 40 mg/dl) is one of the criteria for severity in imported malaria. If we study cases of fever in travellers returning from the tropics, 11% of them present with respiratory infection. In the aetiological study of traveller's pneumonia, viral and bacterial infections (atypical aetiologies being frequent), tuberculosis, Löeffler's syndrome, paragonimiasis, Q fever, coccidiomycosis, meliodiosis and malaria should be considered.

In our patient, we decided to perform studies to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, as he had a suggestive infiltrate in the upper lobe of the right lung and an associated constitutional condition that could be compatible with this diagnosis. For long-stay travellers, as in this case, the incidence of tuberculosis can be as high as for residents of endemic countries.

Cases of melioidosis with pulmonary involvement with tuberculosis-like lesions and cavities in the upper lung lobes have been reported, but this pathology is endemic to Southeast Asia and Oceania. Histoplasmosis also causes lung involvement and is endemic in some parts of Africa (as well as the Americas and some parts of Asia) but our patient did not report activities in caves or ruins, which is the most common form of spore inhalation. Typhoid fever may also be accompanied by respiratory symptoms, although the patient denied consumption of untreated water, nor did he present with abdominal symptoms. There was no eosinophilia, which in a patient with fever and respiratory symptoms would have initially led us to suspect helminthiasis.

Hantaviruses also cause fever and respiratory involvement, but their evolution is usually rapid to severe distress.

Another aetiology to consider is economy class traveller's syndrome, as thromboembolism may present as isolated fever (14% of cases). With regard to the study of febrile syndrome on return from the tropics, it is essential to record in the clinical history the exposures and risk activities that may be associated with potential infections. In our case, our patient did not report having bathed in freshwater areas (rivers, lakes, etc.) in Equatorial Guinea, making schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) and leptospirosis less likely. He denied having had risky sexual contacts leading to acute HIV infection, or to the transmission of other STDs. Nor had she consumed unsanitised dairy products, which would lead us to suspect brucellosis fever. She had not presented exanthema (suggesting infection by Rickettsia or Borrelia), skin rash or haemorrhagic manifestations (suggesting dengue or any other haemorrhagic virus).

Evolution
With the above clinical, epidemiological and analytical data, the following tests are carried out in parallel:
- Rapid malaria diagnostic test (panmalarial and P. falciparum antigens): positive.
- Smear (fine smear): microcytosis, mild thrombopenia, intraerythrocytic parasites compatible with Plasmodium falciparum and isolated extraerythrocytic forms (gametes). Parasitaemia level: 8-10%. Admitted to ICU with a diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria with severity criteria, intravenous (IV) treatment with artesunate (4 doses of 180 mg at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours). At 24 hours the patient was afebrile and the parasitaemia was 0.01% (undetectable at 48 hours).

Subsequently, he was transferred to the Internal Medicine ward, having resolved the fever and arthromyalgia, where he completed sequential treatment with 3 tablets of oral Eurartesim® for 3 days (120 mg/day of piperaquine + 960 mg of dihydroartemisinin). In addition to the above, respiratory isolation measures were taken from the time the patient was admitted to the hospital emergency department, as the possibility of a pulmonary tuberculosis infection was suspected. Treatment was started with intravenous ceftriaxone 2g/24h in view of the possibility of malaria complicated by a pneumonic process, and was subsequently modified to piperacillin- tazobactam 4g/8h iv in view of the CT scan findings requested in the Internal Medicine ward, which showed the presence of cavitary pneumonia in the right upper lobe.

Mantoux was negative (0 mm) and despite inducing sputum, only one sample was obtained and the smear microscopy was negative. Fibrobronchoscopy was requested and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in the bronchoaspirate.

He started anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol (RHZE) adjusted to weight (450/225/1,200/825 mg per day) with good tolerance, and antibiotic treatment was suspended. He remained in respiratory isolation for the first 3 weeks of treatment due to the impossibility of carrying it out at home. During admission, other analytical results were received:
- HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, Strongyloides and Schistosoma serology: negative.
- Blood cultures: negative.
- Study of microfilariae in blood (saponin test): negative.
- Parasites in faeces (3 samples) and urine (1 sample) with concentration techniques: negative.

After 2 months of treatment with 4 drugs, the patient showed a favourable clinical evolution, being asymptomatic at the outpatient examination, with a weight gain of 8 kg. There was also a notable analytical and radiological improvement. He continued treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid for a further 4 months as no resistance mutations to these drugs were detected and the antibiogram of the mycobacterial culture showed no resistance to any of the first-line drugs tested. No side effects due to treatment with artemisinin derivatives, such as hepatitis and, above all, haemolytic anaemia secondary to the administration of artesunate, were observed during follow-up.

Final diagnosis
- Plasmodium falciparum malaria with severity criteria (parasitaemia 8-10%).
- Pulmonary tuberculosis
