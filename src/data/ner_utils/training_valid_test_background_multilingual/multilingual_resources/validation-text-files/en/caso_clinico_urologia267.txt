Anamnesis
Male patient aged 50 years, with the following personal history: no drug allergies, no diseases of interest, no surgical interventions. Toxic habits: smoker of 40 cigarettes a day. He denies other intoxicants.
The patient was referred from an outpatient clinic for possible priapism. He presented with penile swelling with pain for a month. Prior to this clinical picture he had suffered repeated urinary tract infections, urethritis and urethrorrhagia associated with acute urinary retention requiring bladder catheterisation. He had no fever or constitutional syndrome.
He was referred for worsening penile pain and a clinical picture of urinary obstruction in the last few hours, despite medical treatment with analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics. Inquiries were made about risky relationships or intake of toxic substances or drugs, with absolute refusal on the part of the patient.

Physical examination
Good general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative, good skin and mucous membrane colouring. Cardiopulmonary auscultation without alterations. Abdomen soft and depressible, without masses or megaliths, painful on palpation in the hypogastrium due to possible acute retention of urine. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Genital examination: enlarged penis, signs of acute inflammation, with diffuse induration of both corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. There were ulcerated lesions on the glans penis and a whitish, non-malodorous urethral discharge. Testicles of normal size and morphology, without masses and in the scrotal sac, the rest without alterations.

Complementary tests
- Penile Doppler ultrasound: at baseline there are no calcifications in the corpora cavernosa or in the sheaths of the dorsal region of the penis; the calibre of the cavernous arteries is normal, the Doppler recordings are of the pulsatile type, without diastoles, normal. Dorsal penile artery and vein with normal morphology and clearly increased flow. Grade III penile tumescence. No vascular anomalies, arteriovenous fistulas, arterial malformation in the cavernous arteries, nor in the pelvic arteries. Abdominal aorta and iliac vessels with atheromatous walls, calcifications, without morphological or haemodynamic stenosis. Given these findings, the diagnosis of low-flow priapism is established.

Treatment
Bladder catheterisation was attempted but proved impossible, given the penile swelling and urethral exudation. It was therefore decided to perform a temporary suprapubic urinary diversion, and clear urine was extracted.
Cavernous body blood gas analysis was performed: pH 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 35 mmHg and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 64 mmHg. And sample of urethral exudate for culture.
An attempt was made to perform a voiding puncture, but without results, and ephedrine infiltration was used, without achieving detumescence, so it was finally decided to perform a cavernous spongiosal fistula according to the Al-Ghorab and Ercole technique. Admission for observation and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment with doxycycline and piperacycline-tazobactam was therefore decided. After an evident improvement, with a decrease in penile volume, the patient was referred to his referral centre for further antibiotic therapy and subsequent outpatient study.

Diagnosis
Low-flow priapism and acute urethritis.

Evolution
15 days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department from his reference hospital, this time for incomplete paraplegia, with pathological fracture of L4, after presenting with low back pain for more than a week with irradiation towards the knees and intense muscle spasms, with difficulty in walking.
A blood test was performed at the same centre, showing haemoglobin values of 8.8 g/dl, creatinine of 8.78 mg/dl and potassium of 7.12 mEq/l, as the most significant data.
An abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, identifying a 3 cm left adrenal mass, dilatation of the transverse and ascending colon, bilateral para-aortic and inguinal adenopathies, bilateral ureterohydronephrosis, small bladder with irregularity in the anterior wall and dilatation of both ureters at ureterovesical level, at L4 level soft tissue lesion that destroys the right vertebral hemibody and pedicle and invades the medullary space, intimately contacting the medulla, highly suggestive of metastatic lesion or primary tumour.
In view of the findings, a right nephrostomy catheter was placed, with impossibility of placing the left one due to scarce ectasia; dialysis was performed (five sessions) for treatment of acute renal failure and the patient was admitted to the Traumatology Spine Unit for an extension study and to assess surgical intervention.
His blood tests improved after requiring blood transfusions on several occasions. Subsequently, a left nephrostomy was placed, given the increase in ectasia.
The study was completed with a cranial CT scan and a thoracic CT scan, with results of pulmonary nodules in the left upper and left lower lobes, of a tumoural nature, which could correspond to metastatic lesions.
A spinal MRI scan was performed, which showed metastatic bone lesions at D12, L1, L2 and L4, with L4 being particularly compromised, both the vertebral body and the posterior vertebral elements with expansion of the pedicle.
Finally, the bone scan showed pathological focal points in the lumbar spine, right sacroiliac and right femur compatible with bone metastases.
In view of these findings, symptomatic palliative treatment with 3D radiotherapy of the soft tissue mass at vertebral level was proposed.
Transurethral resection of the bladder was performed to assess the bladder lesion, which was found to be fibromuscular tissue infiltrated by high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The case was discussed in the tumour committee (made up of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, urologists and anatomopathologists), and it was decided to maintain a palliative attitude with chemotherapy with 3D radiotherapy of the soft tissue mass at vertebral level. The Traumatology Department carried out a Tokuhashi score assessment (6 points), deciding on conservative treatment.
The patient was admitted to the Palliative Care Unit, where he presented infection by Acinetobacter baumannii and died one month after admission due to multi-organ failure.
