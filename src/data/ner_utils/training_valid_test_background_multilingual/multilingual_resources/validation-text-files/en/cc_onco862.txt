Anamnesis
A 45-year-old male, with no personal or family history of interest, from the Dominican Republic, diagnosed in August 2016 in his country of origin, with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum, following constipation, rectorrhagia and perianal pain.
She came to our centre where a pelvic MRI was performed in September 2016 showing a 9 cm tumour with a mucinous appearance affecting the upper and middle rectum, 6 cm from the anal margin with extensive invasion of the mesorectal fascia, extramural vascular invasion and inguinal and presacral adenopathy. The CT extension study showed retroperitoneal lymph node involvement, thus corresponding to stage IV (cT3dN2M1).
After the case was presented to the multidisciplinary committee for digestive tumours, and given the poor symptomatic control (refractory pain, incipient obstruction and rectorrhagia), treatment with QT-RT was proposed with palliative intent, after performing an unloading colostomy. During surgery, a biopsy of an implant in the mesosigm was performed, with histological results compatible with carcinoma with cells with vacuolated cytoplasm in a signet ring, with immunohistochemical staining consistent with intestinal origin, CK20 (+) CDX2 (+), normal phenotype of repair proteins, BRAF, NRAS and KRAS not mutated. Ascitic fluid was positive for malignant epithelial cells.
In October 2016, she underwent pelvic RT with palliative intent (10x300 cGy) and concomitant capecitabine 825 mg/m2/c12h. Complications included systemic exanthematous infection by parvovirus B19 with associated coagulopathy that required admission. During the hospital stay, a CT scan showed clear tumour progression with pleural effusion, peritoneal dissemination with mild ascites and increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
In November 2016, he started first-line treatment with FOLFOX-6 + cetuximab 500 mg/m2/c14 d with baseline CEA values of 627ng/ml. After the 4th cycle, in January 2017, radiological stability of the disease was observed, with doubtful new bone lesions, but with biochemical response (CEA 92ng/ml).
In February 2017, a bone scan was performed showing a diffuse increase in uptake throughout the skeleton. However, on reviewing the previous CT images, these lesions were already present, and were now also associated with response data. It was therefore decided to continue with the same chemotherapy schedule with the addition of zoledronic acid from the 6th cycle.
In March 2017, he completed 8 cycles, with the most notable toxicities being grade 2 acneiform rash and grade 2 neutropenia. In the re-evaluation CT scan, most of the lesions remained stable, with exclusively bone progression, and with a slight increase in ascites, but less peritoneal uptake. Tumour markers continued to decrease (CEA 52.3 ng/ml).
After the last cycle, and coinciding with the worsening of the acneiform rash, the patient presented with several skin nodules, of progressive onset over the last two weeks, not painful or pruritic, without fever or infectious semiology. In view of the suspicion of secondary involvement, it was decided to refer the patient to the dermatology department for evaluation and performance of a skin biopsy.

Physical examination
Subcutaneous nodules with no epidermal component, 10 to 15 in number, 1-3 cm in diameter, raised, without perilesional phlogosis, hard on palpation and not adherent to deep planes. They are not painful on movement or pressure. No fistulisation. They did not blanch on digitopressure. Absence of desquamation. Distribution in facial, thoracic, dorsal, abdominal and upper limbs.

Complementary tests
Subcutaneous nodules without epidermal component, 10 to 15 in number, 1-3 cm in diameter, raised, without perilesional phlogosis, hard on palpation and not adherent to deep planes. They are not painful on movement or pressure. No fistulisation. They did not blanch on digitopressure. Absence of desquamation. Distribution in facial, thoracic, dorsal, abdominal and upper limbs.
CT scan in March 2017 showed stable pleural effusion, non-specific pulmonary punctate nodules and unchanged mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Ascitic fluid with slight increase. Multiple bone lesions in progression with respect to the previous CT scan.
The pathological findings of the skin biopsy confirmed the occupation of the reticular dermis by multiple nests with glandular morphology or atypical single cells with signet ring cell morphology. They were distributed diffusely in the dermis, or dissecting the collagen bundles. The cells were pleomorphic with large, clear cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry they expressed cytokeratin AE1-AE3, cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.

Diagnosis
Cutaneous metastasis of adenocarcinoma of intestinal origin with signet ring cells.

Treatment
In view of tumour progression at cutaneous level, it was proposed to start second-line treatment according to the FOLFIRI + bevacizumab scheme.

Evolution
Prior to the start of the second line, he presented a rapid clinical deterioration with an increase in skin lesions, and was admitted in April 2017 for intestinal subocclusion. A new CT scan was performed, showing a clear progression of pleural effusion and peritoneal and adenopathic involvement.
Given the risk of perforation, treatment was started exclusively with FOLFIRI without antiangiogenic agents, without response, with worsening of the pleural effusion and associated respiratory failure. The patient died on 29/04/17, 8 months after the initial diagnosis.
