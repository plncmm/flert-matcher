A 50-year-old Senegalese woman living in Spain since 2008 and frequently travelling to her country of origin, an area with a high prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin and glicazide, normofunctioning multinodular goitre, erosive gastritis with Helicobacter pylori and chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV, viral load 609 IU/ml). She lives with people of African origin and had consumed unpasteurised milk.
Over the last year the patient presented with the following symptoms/signs:
- Chronic migratory polyarthritis (predominant involvement of ankles and sacrum). Enteropathy of the plantar fascia with calcification at its insertion in the calcaneus.
- Anterior uveitis (2 episodes).
- Biparietal headache with associated parotid swelling. Cranial computed tomography (CT) with no data of interest.
- Loss of strength in the lower limbs, with falls, hyperalgesia, apalaesthesia, paraesthesia and malleolar oedema. An electromyogram showed a mixed sensory-motor polyneuropathy.
- Erythematous annular plaque on the dorsum of both feet, infiltrated.
- Weight loss of 6 kg in the last few months.
She had no other risk factors for infections or consumption of toxic substances. She had a positive Quantiferon and Mantoux test; the latter was subsequently negative.
Laboratory tests showed dissociated cholestasis, hypercholesterolaemia, hypercalcaemia, hypovitaminosis D and hypergammaglobulinaemia. No evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Immunoglobulin quantification was normal. No paraprotein in blood or urine. The 24-hour urinalysis was normal, including the determination of porphyrins. The immunological study was normal. Angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated (171 IU/L).
Chest X-ray was normal. An abdominal CT scan showed possible bone marrow infiltrative/proliferative pathology in the vertebral bodies and iliac level; this was confirmed by MRI. A thoracic CT scan showed multiple mediastinal adenopathies, the largest measuring 15 mm, subpleural nodules and areas of ground glass in the upper lobes.
All this suggested disseminated granulomatous disease in a patient from a country with a high prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis and chronic HBV infection. A skin biopsy was performed and reported as non-necrotising granulomatous disease. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage - without microbiological isolates and with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio - and FNA of a submammary adenopathy were performed. Pathology of the lymphadenopathy confirmed the presence of non-necrotising granulomatous disease, compatible with sarcoidosis. Other causes such as cancer, autoimmune diseases or infections were ruled out; mainly disseminated tuberculosis with joint involvement (Poncet's disease). Mycobacterium tuberculosis or leprae were not isolated in biopsies, nasal exudate and the rest of the biological fluids studied.
With the diagnosis of probable disseminated sarcoidosis, latent tuberculosis and chronic HBV hepatitis, corticosteroid, tuberculostatic and antiviral treatment was started. Strongyloides strercoralis prophylaxis was also carried out.
