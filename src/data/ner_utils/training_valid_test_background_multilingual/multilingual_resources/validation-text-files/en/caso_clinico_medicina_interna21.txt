Internal Medicine Consultation
Patient for second opinion. A 64 year old man came to consult the Internal Medicine Department of our centre for constitutional symptoms with asthenia, anorexia, loss of up to 10 kg of weight and diarrhoea of 6 months' evolution. In addition, he presented dysphagia for solids due to pharyngeal lichen planus of 2 years' evolution. His past history included 3 admissions in the last year for severe respiratory infections with isolation of multidrug-resistant germs in another centre, requiring intubation and the use of inotropic drugs on all three occasions. He had also been diagnosed in the last year with ocular toxoplasmosis. Other medical history included a mixed cell thymoma resected 7 years ago, with negative follow-up, refractory anaemia (under study), sustained lymphopenia, arterial hypertension, permanent atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild chronic renal failure. The patient was being treated with paracetamol, repaglinide, esomeprazole, silodosin, carvedilol, candesartan, furosemide, prednisone, enoxaparin and digoxin. In consultation, significant general deterioration and poor respiratory pattern were observed. The patient and his relatives described acute symptoms of 4 days' evolution with fever, chills, shivering and purulent expectoration, for which he was referred to the Emergency Department for evaluation and initiation of treatment.

Emergencies
Diagnosis of respiratory failure and severe sepsis. Initial management. On arrival at the ED, the patient appeared serious. Blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, heart rate 121 bpm and respiratory rate 35 rpm. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 76%. Physical examination revealed lip cyanosis and hypoventilation predominantly in the left base, bilateral rhonchi and bibasal crackles. Arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory failure type 1 with PaO2/FiO2 of 167 and mixed alkalosis (pH 7.57, pCO2 38 mmHg and HCO3 34.8 mmol/l). Oxygen therapy was started with a reservoir mask, two peripheral venous accesses were cannulated, blood and urine tests were requested and cultures (blood, urine and sputum) were collected. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were also performed. Volume expansion with sodium chloride, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with Meropenem and Levofloxacin, and steroid administration (stress dose) were started. HIV and CMV viral load tests were also requested due to lymphopenia and history of repeated infections. The electrocardiogram showed tachycardic atrial fibrillation and the chest X-ray showed a focus of increased density in the midfield and left retrocardiac field, with associated pleural effusion. Blood and urine tests showed elevated inflammatory parameters with CRP of 247 mg/l and procalcitonin of 1.7 ng/ml, RIFLE 2 renal failure with creatinine of 1.4 and urea of 96 mg/dl and intense lymphopenia, with 280 lymphocytes x 106/l. In addition, relative neutrophilia with left deviation. Given the significant deterioration of the general condition associated with the risk of intubation, it was decided to transfer him to the Intensive Care Unit.

ICU: Resuscitation and management of the critically ill patient.
Stabilisation of the condition. On arrival in the intensive care area, central venous and peripheral arterial access was cannulated. It was also necessary to perform endotracheal intubation due to progressive respiratory deterioration. The evolution in the first few days was torpid, with persistent need for significant invasive ventilatory support, although the patient maintained haemodynamic stability without requiring vasoactive drugs. Cultures collected in the ED isolated P. mirabilis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, E. aerogenes and A. fumigatus in sputum and P. mirabilis and K. pneumonaie in urine. Cytomegalovirus viral load was positive with a logarithm of 4.86. Antibiotic treatment was sequenced after obtaining results with Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, Voriconazole and Ganciclovir according to antibiograms.

Assessment by Internal Medicine
Diagnosis and treatment adjustment (immunodeficiency). On admission to the ICU, assessment by Internal Medicine was requested to study the chronic process that had led to care in our centre. The patient's history was reviewed and the possibility of a diagnosis of Good syndrome was raised. Good's syndrome is a rare association of thymoma and immunodeficiency that was first described in 1956 by Dr. Robert A. Good, during his studies on the contribution of the thymus in mammalian immunity. Its age of presentation is between 40 and 70 years. The diagnosis of thymoma precedes the diagnosis of the syndrome by 3 months to 18 years, but resection of the thymoma does not prevent the possible onset of immunodeficiency. The most common clinical presentation is recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic diarrhoea, associated with a significant deterioration of the general condition. Common pathogens, in addition to those common in the normal population, include cytomegalovirus and T.gondii. Good's syndrome may also be associated with autoimmune phenomena, including oral lichen planus, present in 12% of cases reported in the literature. From the pathophysiological point of view, it is a hypogammaglobulinaemia associated with B-cell deficiency and defects in cellular immunity, the mechanisms of which remain unknown at present. Additional tests performed on admission showed hypogammaglobulinaemia of 0.3 g/dl in the proteinogram. Serum immunoglobulins were requested with the finding of a global immunoglobulin deficiency, with IgG values of 412 mg/dl, IgA 85 mg/dl and IgM 13 mg/dl. A study of lymphocyte subpopulations was also performed (0.18% of B lymphocytes compared to 91.93% of T lymphocytes). In view of these findings, the torpid evolution of the condition and the severity of the patient, it was decided in agreement with the Haematology Department and the Intensive Care Unit doctors to start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. The evolution in the following days was slowly favourable, with a gradual decrease in inflammatory parameters and ventilatory support requirements. The patient maintained haemodynamic stability and enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube at all times, and the diarrhoea he had on admission also improved. Extubation was carried out with good tolerance, initially requiring non-invasive ventilatory support with BiPAP and high-flow nasal goggles in the Intermediate Care Unit. The patient was finally transferred to the hospital in his place of residence once the acute symptoms had resolved and treatment for his immunodeficiency was started, 8 days after admission to our centre and 2 days after discharge from the ICU. At discharge he was haemodynamically stable, afebrile and with an adequate respiratory pattern and peripheral saturations estimated by pulse oximetry at >90% with minimal oxygen supply by nasal cannula.

Evolution after discharge
After discharge, the patient completed antibiotic and rehabilitation treatment at the hospital in his place of residence and was discharged home shortly afterwards, without the need for supplementary oxygen therapy. Subsequently, he has maintained regular check-ups in his locality and monthly administration of intravenous gamma globulins, as indicated after diagnosis of Good's syndrome. During the first 6 months after discharge, she had no symptoms of any new infection. Diarrhoeal discharges have partially improved and weight has stabilised. Dysphagia also improved. Despite persistent asthenia, the patient reports improvement in general condition, and has regained independence for activities of daily living.
