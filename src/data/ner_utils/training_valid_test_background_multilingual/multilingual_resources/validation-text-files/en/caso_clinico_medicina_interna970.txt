We present a 35-year-old male who was admitted to our unit for fever of 1 month's evolution after an intravenous procedure. He has a personal history of two pericarditis. 11 months before admission, he presented with extensive deep vein thrombosis in the left lower limb (lupus anticoagulant positive in a determination) and May-Thurner syndrome was found to be the cause. After 10 months of anticoagulant treatment, she presented severe post-thrombotic syndrome, so a percutaneous pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was performed in the left iliac vein with placement of a venous stent. Ten days after the procedure he developed fever.
He had been admitted on two occasions in the last month due to fever, and an exhaustive study was carried out (cultures, serology, autoimmunity, computerised tomography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms) without finding the cause (suspected infection). Finally, she was admitted to our centre, where she continued her studies. Anamnesis: high fever (40oC) with daily shivering and odynophagia, frequent oral ulcers, a fondness for ornithology and a visit to the countryside prior to the onset of fever. Physical examination: fever and oral aphthae. PET-CT scan showed 3 cm thrombosis in the right ventricle, stent rethrombosis with uptake points in both sites suggestive of infection, as well as thrombosis of the inferior vena cava up to the infrarenal level and thrombosis of the right iliac vein. Blood cultures and serology were negative, except for C. burnetii Ig G phase I titre 1/800. A difficult differential diagnosis of intracardiac thrombus (septic stent thrombophlebitis and infective endocarditis, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic Q fever endocarditis) was made and he was finally diagnosed with Beh√ßet's disease with intracardiac thrombosis and extensive venous thromboembolic disease. He underwent immunosuppressive treatment with disappearance of fever, general improvement and reduction of thrombi.
