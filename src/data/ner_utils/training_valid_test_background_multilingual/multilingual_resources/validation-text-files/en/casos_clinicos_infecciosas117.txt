58-year-old female, Costa Rican, resident of Desamparados, pensioner. She was admitted in July 2008 (summer in the Northern Hemisphere) to the Hospital San Juan de Dios, having returned 8 days earlier from a trip to North Florida, in the United States - where she had been walking in a forest known to have a high tick population - and had presented, since three days earlier, with an unquantified fever, general malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. One of her daughters had removed a tick from her left scapular region on the day of admission to hospital.

The initial physical examination showed no pathological findings, except for T 38.5Â°C. The clinical evolution during her hospital stay was satisfactory, with disappearance of fever after three days. There was no arthritis or skin alterations. There was no evidence of adenomegaly, jaundice, heart murmurs, neurological alterations or hepatosplenomegaly. He was discharged on day eight, in good general condition. Suspicion of Lyme disease led to the prescription of doxycycline 100mg bid VO for two weeks, which was very well tolerated by the patient.
