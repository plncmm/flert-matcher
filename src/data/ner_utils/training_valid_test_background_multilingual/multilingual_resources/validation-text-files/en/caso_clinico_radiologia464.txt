48-year-old woman with periumbilical abdominal pain, vomiting, fever and loss of 10 kg in one month. She had a history of abdominoplasties and had been an intrauterine device (IUD) user for 10 years, with no gynaecological check-ups. Examination revealed an infraumbilical stone mass and mucoid umbilical discharge. Leukocytosis with left shift and elevated CRP (206.9 mg/L). The gynaecological ultrasound showed a myoma as the only finding. An abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed to evaluate infectious/tumour pathology and possible puncture, identifying a lesion in the anterior abdominal wall, with hypercapillary borders, extending towards the anterior musculature and intra-abdominal fat. There was a left parauterine lesion and ipsilateral hydronephrosis due to extrinsic compression. Microbiological examination of the abdominal lesion isolated anaerobic germs (Actinomyces europaeus and radingae).
