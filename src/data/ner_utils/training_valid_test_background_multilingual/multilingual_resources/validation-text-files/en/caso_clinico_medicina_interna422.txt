A 56-year-old woman consulted for asthenia and generalised weakness of 45 days' duration. She also presented with fever (39oC), holocranial headache without associated focality and low back pain of 6 months of evolution.

History: Native of Morocco (last trip 3 years ago). DM II on treatment with metformin 850mg. Correct vaccination. No animals at home.

Evolution
Complete blood tests (anodine) and chest X-ray showed an extensive bilateral diffuse micronodular pattern.
Further study with a thoracic CT scan confirmed diagnostic suspicion.
Mantoux test (negative), IGRA (indeterminate) and complete laboratory tests were performed, including serology (all negative).
48 hours after admission, deviation of the left eyeball was observed: examination revealed paralysis of the left sixth cranial nerve.
Cerebral+medullary MRI was performed with multiple nodular cerebral and medullary lesions, which, given the history, were compatible with tuberculomas and gadolinium uptake in relation to tuberculous meningoencephalitis with encephalic and medullary involvement.
A lumbar puncture was performed and PCR was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Treatment was started with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol. Favourable evolution, with resolution of the paralysis of the LV P.C., for which she was sent home to complete treatment.
A contact study was carried out by primary care.
In subsequent check-ups, a chest X-ray and MRI were performed, with disappearance of the lesions in the brain and spinal cord.
