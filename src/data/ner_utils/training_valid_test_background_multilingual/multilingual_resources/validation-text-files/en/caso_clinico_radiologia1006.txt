80-year-old male presented with massive haemoptysis and was intubated.
CXR showed a ball within a cavity in the right upper lobe (air crescent sign) pathognomonic of a mycetoma (also called aspergilloma).
A lateral decubitus CXR may demonstrate the fungal ball shifting position. In this condition, a preformed cavity becomes colonised, usually by Aspergillus fumigatus. Cavitary disease may be secondary to fibrotic lung disease, e.g. previous TB, sarcoidosis, or ankylosing spondylitis. Massive haemoptysis may occur and a bronchial angiogram with embolotherapy is temporary.
Surgical resection is definitive, but bronchopleural fistula may occur. Unfortunately most patients have insufficient pulmonary reserve to allow surgical resection.
