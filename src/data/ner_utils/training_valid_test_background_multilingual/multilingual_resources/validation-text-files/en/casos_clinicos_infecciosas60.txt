We present the case of a 66-year-old woman whose most relevant personal medical-surgical history includes: the absence of known allergic drug reactions; long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) treated with insulin therapy with poor glycaemic control; liver cirrhosis of probable autoimmune origin with activity and clinical data of portal hypertension with multiple hydropic decompensations treated with deflazacort and 6-mercaptopurine and chronic renal insufficiency with secondary hyperparathyroidism being monitored by the Nephrology Service. The patient underwent cholecystectomy in 2002 and underwent surgery for well-differentiated and infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 2012, with lymph node emptying under follow-up by the maxillofacial surgery department. The patient attended the emergency department in February 2015, presenting with left eye pain for three weeks with progressive loss of vision, accompanied by pain in the nasal, periorbital and left frontal region. He reported a fever of 38oC in the last week. Examination revealed a reddened area on the left periorbital and maxillary region that was painful on palpation. The left eye showed a certain degree of proptosis and the ipsilateral pupil was in mid-irreactive mydriasis. The rest of the examination was unremarkable with normal vital signs.

Differential diagnosis
The patient presented with an acute and progressive episode of facial pain and fever, with a history of immunosuppression due to corticosteroids, type 2 DM and surgery for tongue carcinoma. Among the clinical entities presenting with facial pain, trigeminal neuralgia would be a possible diagnosis, but unlikely due to the presence of fever. The patient's neoplastic history should be taken into account, given that the facial pain could be the consequence of tumour recurrence with invasion of the paranasal sinuses, although the existence of fever, the absence of constitutional signs or symptoms and the acute onset would make this an unlikely diagnosis. Bacterial sinusitis mainly due to Pseudomonas spp. or fungal sinusitis due to Aspergillus spp. or Mucorales would be a very likely diagnosis given the clinical picture and the patient's personal history.

Evolution
Given the clinical suspicion of rhinocerebral mucormycosis, an urgent CT scan of the paranasal sinuses was performed, showing occupation of the left maxillary, frontal and sphenoid sinuses, as well as the left nostril and ethmoid cells on this side. Thinning of the bony septa of the ethmoid cells, the floor of the orbit and the inner wall of the left maxillary sinus, with erosion of the latter. There is increased attenuation of the fat and soft tissues of the left masticatory space, with increased density in the left pterygopalatine fossa. These findings would be related to an infectious-inflammatory process. There was no evidence of intracerebral alterations. At the same time, an urgent analytical study was carried out, where the haemogram showed an anaemia with a known microcytic and hypochromic profile. Leukocytes 11980 cells/microlitre (normal: 4000-11000 cells/microlitre) with absolute neutrophils 10850 cells/microlitre (n: 2000-7500 cells/microlitre). Platelets 306000 cells/microlitre (n: 150000-400000 cells/microlitre). Coagulation normal. Biochemistry: glucose 300 mg/dl (n: 70-100 mg/dl), urea 86.9 mg/dl (n: 7-18 mg/dl), creatinine 1.52 mg/dl (n: 0.6-1.4 mg/dl). Sodium 125 meq/L (n: 136-145 meq/L) and Potassium 5 meq/L (N: 3.5-4.5 meq/L). CRP 103 mg/L (n: 0-5 mg/L). Venous blood gases showed metabolic acidemia with pH 7.20 (N: 7.35-7.45), PCO2 34 mmHg (n: 35-45 mmHg) and HCO3 15 mmol/L (n: 18-23 mmol/L). The urine showed the presence of ketone bodies.

In view of this clinical situation, an ENT endoscopic examination was performed in the operating theatre, revealing an inflamed mucosa with necrotic patches of the entire septum and floor of the left nostril. There was necrosis in the inferior and middle turbinates with visible whitish patches. The rest of the examination was normal.

In the same exploratory act and in view of the findings described, which confirmed the initial diagnosis of suspicion, urgent surgery was carried out, performing a median turbinectomy, excision of the mucosa of the inferior turbinate, as well as the septum and floor of the fossa. A very wide median meatotomy was performed, resecting the entire sinus mucosa, anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy, sphenoidotomy and resection of the diseased mucosa. During the surgical procedure, samples are collected and sent to the microbiology and pathological anatomy departments.

Once the urgent surgical intervention has been performed, correction of the underlying predisposing risk factors (the patient's metabolic acidosis and hyperglycaemia) is initiated. Simultaneously, empirical intravenous antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (5mg/kg/24 hours) and caspofungin (loading dose of 70 mg on the first day followed by 50 mg/24 hours adjusted to the patient's weight) was started. A cranial MRI was requested as a control imaging test.

The microbiology laboratory urgently reported the existence of a pathogenic fungus belonging to the Mucorales order, Rhizopus spp. Subsequently, after identification, it turned out to be Rhizopus oryzae. The pathology laboratory also reported the existence of angioinvasion by the fungus and therefore findings compatible with mucormycosis.

The patient's evolution was torpid due to the existence of facial pain that was difficult to control, which led to a new review by the Otorhinolaryngology Department, which requested a new cranial CAT scan. The new test performed showed inflammatory changes secondary to the previous surgery, with no evidence of central nervous system involvement. In the following days, the patient presented with abdominal pain and distension accompanied by diarrhoea, a request was made for detection of Clostridium difficile toxin in stool, which was positive, and targeted treatment was started. Within 48 hours, the patient's clinical picture worsened despite treatment, and she died.

Final diagnosis
Rhizopus oryzae rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Nosocomial diarrhoea associated with Clostridium difficile infection. Metabolic acidosis secondary to chronic renal failure and probable diabetic ketoacidosis.
