Anamnesis
A 34-year-old woman came to the emergency department with suprapubic abdominal pain. No family history. Pathological history: IA smoker 10 pack/year. Non-drinker. FUR: 6/1/2014. No known drug allergies.

Physical examination
Head and neck: no palpable cervical adenopathies. AC: rhythmic, no murmurs. PA: preserved vesicular murmur, no over-added noises. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, laparotomy wound in good condition. Lower limbs: no oedema.

Complementary tests
"IQ was performed on 24/2/2013, observing a 10 cm tumour on the left side, left adnexectomy and lumpectomy were performed, with anatomopathological result of 11 cm papillary serous cystoadenocarcinoma limited to the ovary (pT1a).
"Following the findings, a CT-CT scan was performed showing a solid lung mass with hypodense areas at the level of the spiculated LSD measuring 5 x 3 x 4 cm, a 3 cm right adrenal mass suspected of metastasis, pathological lymphadenopathies in the portocaval space, retroperitoneal, para-aortic.
"Given the possibility of a synchronous tumour, she was assessed by Pneumology, and on 31/12/2013 a bronchoscopy was performed, in which an endobronchial lesion was observed at the level of the LSD.
"Biopsies were taken, with the result of a poorly differentiated infiltrating carcinoma and immunohistochemical profile compatible with lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 +, p63 negative, keratin CK56: negative, CEA, chromogranin and calcitonin positive, thyroglobulin: negative).
"A PET-CT scan was performed, showing areas of hyper uptake at the level of the LSD, cutaneous, lymph node, bone, subcutaneous and right adrenal, with the diagnosis of E IC ovarian cystadenocarcinoma and E IV lung adenocarcinoma, and she was sent to the Medical Oncology department.
"EGFR and ALK were requested (negative results) and biopsies of the SC nodule were performed, with the result of cutaneous metastasis of moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.
"In view of the results, a thyroid ultrasound scan was requested, showing a poorly defined irregular area of 1.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm in the right hemithyroid, as well as lymphadenopathy in the contralateral jugulo-carotid chain. Calcitonin: 776 .
"Given the diagnostic doubt, a thyroid biopsy was requested, with the result of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Due to the adrenal involvement, the possibility of pheochromocytoma was suspected and catecholamines were requested in blood and urine, which were positive. PTH: normal.
"RET proto-oncogene: de novo RET gene mutation.

Diagnosis
"Metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma.
"Suspected pheochromocytoma in association with MEN 2B syndrome.
"Ovarian cystadenocarcinoma and HF.

Treatment
With the result of probable medullary thyroid, treatment was started (January 2014) with vandetanib 300 mg/24h. She attended a check-up one month later, with improvement in her functional situation and a decrease in subcutaneous nodules. At the March check-up, she reported an increase in abdominal circumference and lumbar pain, so an MRI scan was performed, showing cauda equina syndrome, and IC to RT was performed with treatment with 30 Gy. Given the suspicion of progression, a CT-CT scan was performed, showing progression of the disease with an increase in bilateral supraclavicular adenopathies, increase in pulmonary nodules, increase in the right adrenal mass and appearance of a left adrenal mass, appearance of a mass at the level of the right ovary, calcitonin 1,455 (previously 776). Given the diagnostic doubt and the progression of the disease to vandetanib (first line in medullary thyroid), the case was presented at the oncology session and it was decided to start treatment with carboplatin + taxol (first line of unknown origin). The patient received three cycles of carbo-taxol and the CT scan to assess the response to the progression of the disease showed an increase in supraclavicular adenopathies, an increase in the lung mass of the LSD, an increase in the right and left adrenal mass, an increase in the right adnexal mass and an increase in bone metastases. Given that the tumour has neuroendocrine features and the poor response to vandetanib, treatment with gemcitabine + 80% irinotecan was started in March 2014. She received treatment for three cycles and on 7/7/2014, the response assessment CT scan showed a decrease in supraclavicular adenopathies, a decrease in cutaneous metastases, a decrease in the LSD mass, a decrease in bilateral adrenal masses, a decrease in abdomino-pelvic adenopathies and a decrease in the right adnexal mass. On 18/7/2014 the patient was admitted for febrile syndrome and appearance of bilateral multiple brain metastases, receiving holocranial RDT.

Evolution
Patient diagnosed with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma with adrenal involvement. First-line treatment was started with vandetanib with progression after three cycles. Switched to a line of QT of unknown origin, with new progression. Third line of treatment was started with gemcitabine + CPT 11, with response after three cycles and CNS progression.

Admitted on 26/8/2014 due to neurological deterioration, dying during admission. A necropsy was requested, but the family did not want it.
