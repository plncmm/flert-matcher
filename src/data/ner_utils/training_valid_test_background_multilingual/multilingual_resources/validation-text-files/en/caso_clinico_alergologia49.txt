An 8-year-old girl with a history of rhinitis and allergic asthma due to sensitisation to mites and cat epithelium, on basic treatment with inhaled budesonide and mite immunotherapy. The patient started treatment with oral prednisolone and bronchodilators for acute bronchitis. One hour after administration of the prednisolone dose, she developed dizziness, malaise, vomiting and urticaria unrelated to other triggering factors. At the health centre he was treated with methylprednisolone and intramuscular antihistamine, presenting increased urticarial lesions and general malaise. Intramuscular adrenaline was administered and the symptoms resolved within a few hours.

Results:
Group A corticosteroid skin tests were positive (positive prick to prednisolone and prednisone and positive intradermal reaction to hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone). Group B corticosteroid skin tests (triamcinolone, paramethasone, deflazacort and budesonide suspension) and Group C (dexamethasone and betamethasone) were negative.
