We present the case of a 48-year-old female patient from the Dominican Republic, resident in Spain for 15 years, who had last travelled to her country the previous year. She came to the emergency department for diffuse abdominal pain of 5 days' evolution, with a diarrhoeic bowel rhythm that had not changed in the last year (about 2-3 stools per day of soft consistency, without mucus, with occasional traces of fresh blood), no fever, no skin lesions or other accompanying symptoms. Haemodynamically stable, physical examination with no findings.
Main history of interest, ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome secondary to left adrenal adenoma detected in 2015 and operated on 2 months earlier by unilateral adrenalectomy. After the operation, she received supraphysiological doses of corticosteroids, in a descending pattern. Three weeks prior to this consultation, she presented self-referred symptoms of acute gastroenteritis with vomiting for 3 days, for which she did not adequately take corticosteroid replacement treatment and presented an episode of adrenal insufficiency that led to admission to Endocrinology and treatment with high doses of corticosteroids, currently on a descending dosage of 5 mg of prednisone per day. Laboratory tests showed Hb 12 g/dl and 16,000 leukocytes due to peripheral eosinophilia (3870 cells/μL, 24.2%) with no other findings. Chest X-ray with no pathological findings and abdominal ultrasound with no abnormalities. A coproparasitological study was requested in which Strongyloides stercoralis rhabditiform and filariform larvae were visualised. Giardia antigen, Cryptosporidium antigen, Entamoeba antigen and Kinyoun stain were negative, as well as serology for HIV, HTLV 1,2, HAV, HCV, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides and Blastomyces, all negative; IgG serology for Strongyloides was positive.
A diagnosis of chronic diarrhoea due to Strongyloides stercolaris was made and treatment was started with ivermectin 12 mg (200 μg/kg/day) in two doses one week apart after ruling out hyperinfestation syndrome, although with close follow-up due to clinical exacerbation after taking corticosteroids.
