45-year-old woman, resident in the urban area of Santiago de Cali (Valle del Cauca, Colombia), of low socioeconomic status, with occupation "candy seller" in the street. She had a history of chronic gastritis, severe malnutrition, four pregnancies with three living children and tubal ligation surgery 16 years earlier. She had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or smoking. She had a habit of drinking unsafe water.

The clinical picture began three months before her hospital admission, consisting of pain in the mesogastrium, asthenia, adynamia and oedema in the lower extremities, evolving after two months with episodes of fetid diarrhoea, emesis, and loss of appetite and weight. In the last few days he presented episodes of haemoptotic cough.

She consulted a peripheral health centre where S. stercolaris larvae were found on direct stool examination with 0.9% physiological saline and Lugol's solution. Medical treatment was started with ivermectin for two days (200 μg/kg/day) and albendazole (400 mg/day). Laboratory tests included an albumin of 0.5 g/dL, negative serology for HIV and positive serology for HTLV I-II. TSH was normal. Seven days later the patient was referred to an outpatient Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory distress. Presumptive diagnoses were pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), Lóeffler's syndrome or bacterial pneumonia.

She was admitted to the ICU conscious, with signs of respiratory distress, tachycardic, afebrile, with arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) by pulse oximetry of 87%, with oxygen support (FiO2 50%). Physical examination revealed fine bibasal pulmonary rales, abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation, grade III oedema in the lower extremities and the presence of erythematous, pruritic, non desquamative lesions on the skin, predominantly on the thighs. Admission tests showed white blood cells 26,200/mm3, haemoglobin 9.1 g/dL, neutrophils 86%, eosinophils 2%, C-reactive protein (CRP) 18 mg/dL, electrolytes and creatinine within normal ranges, severe hypoxaemia without acid-base disorder. Chest X-ray showed the presence of diffusely distributed mixed infiltrates with alveolar predominance. Anteroposterior chest X-ray showed diffuse alveolar-dominated mixed infiltrates in both lung fields. Chest X-ray after pharmacological treatment.

The patient evolved with progressive respiratory distress, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, without the need for high ventilatory parameters. She also required vasoactive support with norepinephrine due to persistent arterial hypotension. In his clinical evolution he presented constant haematic respiratory secretions with a significant decrease in haemoglobin, requiring red blood cell transfusion. Suspecting bacterial pneumonia, broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated. Subsequently, positive blood and urine cultures were reported for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC), and treatment was changed to meropenem. Suspecting pulmonary strongyloidosis, fresh microscopy of an orotracheal secretion sample was requested and S. stercoralis larvae were observed, so a new dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) was administered and oral albendazole (400 mg, twice daily) was continued. Photomicrograph of Strongyloides stercoralis filariform larvae in tracheal secretion sample. Pulmonary tuberculosis was also ruled out with negative serial smears. A colonoscopy was performed and the pathology report was a non-specific mild chronic colitis. Immunological tests for the diagnosis of strongyloidosis were not performed.

Progressive weaning from ventilatory support was performed, achieving extubation on the fifth day of invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient completed a hospital stay of 12 days, during which time she had repeated episodes of dry cough. At clinical follow-up, the coproscopic study showed no evidence of intestinal parasites, and the chest X-ray at 15 days showed significant resolution of the pulmonary infiltrate. He completed 10 days of anthelmintic treatment with albendazole. The discharge haemoglobin was 9.9 g/dL.

During her stay in the institution the patient received physiotherapy management, where a favourable evolution of her cardiorespiratory condition and level of functionality was observed.
