Anamnesis
The patient complains of generalised abdominal discomfort related to abdominal distension, with an important general syndrome (asthenia, loss of appetite and progressive weight loss). Dyspnoea on moderate exertion. No infectious symptoms at present.

Physical examination
ECOG 2. Haemodynamically stable and afebrile. Jaundice in skin, mucous membranes and conjunctivae. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tones, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: global hypoventilation. Abdomen: very distended, uncomfortable on palpation, large hepatomegaly up to 15 cm below the right costal margin. Lower extremities: no oedema.

Complementary tests
Blood tests before starting cytostatic treatment: Hb 7.8 g/dl, leukocytes 36,800 mmc, platelets 547,000 mmc, creatinine 0.71 mg/dl, total bilirubin 4.7 mg/dl, sodium 127 mEq/l, potassium 4.9 mEq/l, calcium 9 mg/dl. On previous days, the uric acid level was 10.4 mg/dl. Regarding neuroendocrine tumour markers, he had neuronal specific enolase 309.3 ng/ml and chromogranin A 914.4 ng/ml.

Diagnosis
With a diagnosis of G3 NEC (ki-67: 90 %) of stage IV cardia, with multisystem involvement, the patient was admitted to Medical Oncology and started 1st line of cytostatic treatment for advanced disease with carboplatin AUC-4 (day 1) + etoposide 80 mg/m2 (days 1, 2, 3) every 21 days, with dose reduction due to ECOG and hepatic involvement. Transfusion of 2 red blood cell concentrates was also performed.
The following day, the patient showed significant clinical deterioration, with dyspnoea at rest and oxygen saturation below 90%, requiring oxygen therapy with a reservoir. Laboratory tests were performed, showing: uric acid 15.4 mg/dl, creatinine 1.02 mg/dl, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dl, total cholesterol 577 mg/dl, LDL 522 mg/dl, sodium 125 mEq/l, potassium 5.7 mEq/l, calcium 8.6 mg/dl. Arterial blood gases showed pH 7.31, pCO2 25 mm Hg, pO2 56 mm Hg, bicarbonate 12.6 mmol/l, excess of bases 12.1 mmol/l and oxygen saturation 86 % (with MKV at 50 %).
Treatment was started with allopurinol 100 mg/8h orally, rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg/day intravenously in single doses, furosemide 20 mg/8 h intravenously and intensive serum therapy, maintaining antifungal treatment with fluconazole, which was started due to isolation of Candida albicans in oesophageal brushing performed during gastroscopy.
Blood tests and venous blood gases: uric acid 4.7 mg/dl, creatinine 1.61 mg/dl, calcium 8.2 mg/dl, sodium 132 mEq/l, potassium 6 mEq/l, phosphorus 8.1 mg/dl, pH 7.28, bicarbonate 16.9 mmol/l, pCO2 36 mm Hg, base excess-9.1 mmol/l.
In view of the progressive clinical deterioration, Intensive Care Medicine was notified and the patient was transferred to their department with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure and tumour lysis syndrome with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis.

Treatment
He continued ICU support, requiring continuous non-invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive serum therapy with ion replacement, as well as empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, maintaining antifungal treatment with fluconazole.
The presence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on portable chest X-ray was noted, establishing the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary haemorrhage and infectious complication.

Evolution
The patient evolved favourably, ventilatory support was withdrawn, with creatinine, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium and potassium levels in the normal range. After 8 days in ICU, he was transferred back to Medical Oncology. We performed a new control chest X-ray with a great improvement compared to the previous one. She presented progressive recovery of her general condition and it was decided to discharge her home in the following days.
