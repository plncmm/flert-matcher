Anamnesis
A 33-year-old female patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department for cough, muco-purulent expectoration, febrile fever and dyspnoea. These symptoms had been present for 7 years, although they had worsened in the last week. As epidemiological history of interest, he reported contact with pigeons.

Physical examination
Examination revealed the presence of dry crackles in both lung bases, with a SatO2 of 96% with nasal goggles at 2 bpm, BP 120/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm and Ta37.2oC. The rest of the examination by apparatus and systems was anodyne.

Complementary tests
Haemogram, biochemistry, autoimmunity analysis, angiotensin converting enzyme within normal limits.
Imaging tests included a chest X-ray, which showed a bilateral interstitial infiltrate predominantly in the lung bases. CT showed bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe and lingula, associated with a reticulo-nodular pattern in both bases (Figure 2). Mantoux test was positive. Precipitins against pigeon droppings were negative. Respiratory function tests showed a restrictive pattern (FVC 55%, FEV1/FVC 78%) and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage showed no pathological findings. Bronchoalveolar lavage culture for bacteria and mycobacteria was positive for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).

Clinical Judgement
Lady Windermere Syndrome: Chronic respiratory infection by MAC predominantly affecting the middle lobe and lingula.

Action plan and evolution
Treatment was started with Clarithromycin, Rifampicin and Ethambutol for 12 months, in accordance with clinical guidelines.
After a year and a half, the patient showed clear clinical improvement with negative sputum MAC. However, given the presence of bronchiectasis, the patient continues to suffer from recurrent Pseudomona aeruginosa infections.
