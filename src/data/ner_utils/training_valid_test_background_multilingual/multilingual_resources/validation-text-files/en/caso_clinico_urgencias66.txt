A 14-year-old patient with no past history of interest came to the emergency department with headache, drowsiness, fever, clumsiness in walking and stiff neck for 48 hours. He reported fever, cough and diarrhoea for the last week. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38°C with general malaise, other vital signs, cardiopulmonary auscultation and normal abdominal examination. The neurological examination revealed a Glasgow 14-15, dysarthria, somnolence, nuchal rigidity, positive Kerning and Brudzinski, nystagmus in the left lateral gaze, proximal muscle strength in the lower limbs 3/5, with less movement in the left. The rest of the neurological examination showed no findings. Analytically, biochemistry, haemogram and haemostasis were strictly normal, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.83 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.2 ng/mL. The cranial computerised axial tomography (CAT) scan performed was normal and the lumbar puncture showed glucose 52 mg/dL, 230 leukocytes with 85% mononuclear and protein 70 mg/dL. Given the findings compatible with acute encephalopathy and paresis in the lower extremities, treatment was started with cefotaxime, vancomycin and acyclovir and she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where the study was completed. The electrorencephalogram showed bilateral posterior slow focality, predominantly on the right, with preserved background activity. The electromyogram did not rule out polyradiculoneuritis or motor neuron involvement. The spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse, patchy, poorly demarcated spinal cord involvement, compatible with an inflammatory process of the acute encephalomyelitis type. The brain MRI showed patchy alteration in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles, midbrain and ganglia of the base, predominantly on the right, compatible with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Serologies for Brucella, Lúes, mycoplasma, measles, varicellazoster, cytomegalovirus and Lyme were negative. In view of the findings, treatment was started with gamma globulins and intravenous corticosteroids at high doses, maintaining the antibiotic and antiviral treatment until the results of the cultures were obtained. After the cultures and PCR were negative for herpes virus, antimicrobial treatment was withdrawn. The patient showed slow but progressive clinical improvement, with persistent paresis in the lower extremities, tendency to somnolence and dysarthria. With the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, he was transferred to the paediatric department, where he progressed favourably and was discharged with home treatment, being referred to rehabilitation to complete treatment.
