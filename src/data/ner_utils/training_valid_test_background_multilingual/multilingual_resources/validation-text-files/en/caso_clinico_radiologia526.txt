A 49 year old HIV+ male, who underwent an urgent abdominal CT scan due to suspicion of intestinal obstruction.

Significant dilatation of intestinal loops with the "stool sign", grouped in the right hemiabdomen. Poor definition of some segments of distal ileum with hypodense wall, probably due to hypoperfusion. Moderate amount of free peritoneal fluid. Terminal ileum and large bowel of normal calibre. These findings are compatible with mechanical obstruction of the small intestine, probably due to internal hernia, with radiological signs of vascular compromise.
