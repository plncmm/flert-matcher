25-year-old woman with a history of exposure to acrylic powder for one year. Symptoms began six months after exposure to the powder, with repeated infectious symptoms treated with multiple antimicrobials with partial reduction of the clinical picture. Symptomatology worsened with progression of dyspnoea to grade 2 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.6 On physical examination, vital signs were normal, temperature 36. 1 oC, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, heart rate 80/min, respiratory rate 23 breaths/min, and haemoglobin saturation with 75% oxygen in room air, physical examination showed scattered inspiratory crackles in both hemithoraxes, normal blood biometry, blood chemistry without alterations. Arterial blood gases on room air revealed pH 7.4, PO2 50 mmHg, PCO2 34 mmHg, SO2 75% and HCO3 24 mmHg. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were normal. Spirometry and plethysmography with very severe restrictive pattern. Forced expiratory volume at first second (FEV1) 0.98 L (31%), FEV1/FVC 116%, forced vital capacity (FVC) 0.99 L (26%) of predicted, total lung capacity 1680 mL (31%), residual volume 630 mL (32%), with decreased diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO 34% of predicted). During a six-minute walk, he covered 350 m with Borh 3-4 dyspnoea and 89% oxygen saturation, as he was 72% saturated on room air. Expectoration cultures were negative in mycological, bacteriological and mycobacterio-logical examinations, including nocardia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and HRCT showed thickening of the interlobular septa, predominantly bilateral peripheral, with cotonous opacities in mo-saic and other ground-glass opacities. Fibrobronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) aspirating milky and frothy material. There were no endobronchial abnormalities. Cytology revealed lymphocytes, proteinaceous material and alveolar macrophages. A diagnosis of alveolar proteinosis was made. Two BALs were performed over a period of three months with partial improvement of the symptoms, for which treatment with GM-CSF was started subcutaneously, without clinical improvement. Currently, she continues to be treated with BAL every two to three months.
