Anamnesis
An 85-year-old patient, with no personal history of interest, consulted for pruritic lesions of several months' evolution located in the right pretibial area. She had been treated with topical antibiotics by her primary care doctor without improvement.

Physical examination:
Physical examination revealed a well-defined erythematous-edematous plaque with vesicular-ampullous lesions on its surface, together with eroded and crusted areas. 

Additional examinations
With suspicion of a blistering disease, several skin biopsies were taken, which showed a fusocellular dermal proliferation, covered by an extensively ulcerated epidermis with epidermal crusting and superficial necrosis of the dermis, with marked oedema throughout its thickness and positivity for human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), all compatible with the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma in tumour stage associated with lymphoedema.
The analytical study showed no pathological findings, except for mild iron deficiency anaemia and positive serology for HHV-8. The rest of the complementary examinations (chest X-ray and abdominal and lymph node ultrasound) showed no alterations. The patient was referred to the Internal Medicine Department of our hospital to complete a study of iron deficiency anaemia, which was normal.

Diagnosis
Kaposi's sarcoma, bullous.

Treatment
The lesions were surgically removed, with no subsequent recurrence.
