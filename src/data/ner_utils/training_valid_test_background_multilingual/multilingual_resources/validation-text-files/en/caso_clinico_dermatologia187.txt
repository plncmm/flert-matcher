Anamnesis
A 39-year-old man, with a history of depression and dyslipidaemia under pharmacological treatment (bupropion, desvenlafaxine, rosuvastatin and fenofibrate) and psoriasis for 13 years, who consulted for exanthema on the trunk and pustular lesions in the groin, popliteal hollows and distal part of the lower limbs. The rash had appeared about 20 days after starting a new drug (lamotrigine), which she discontinued. The pustular lesions appeared a few days after discontinuation of oral prednisone, which she had started taking without a prescription due to an outbreak of plaque psoriasis.

Physical examination
Examination revealed an erythematous-papular maculo-papular rash, confluent in some areas, leaving areas of skin spared, affecting the trunk. Plaques of pre-existing psoriasis can be seen in the dorsal region. In the inguinal region and popliteal hollows there are erythematous papules, infiltrated, of different sizes between 0.5-2 cm, as well as pustules on an erythematous base in different stages of evolution, some of them with a necrotic centre.

Complementary examinations
Biopsies were taken of one of the pustular lesions showing psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epithelium with oedema in the papillary dermis, band-like and perivascular infiltrate and neutrophil exocytosis forming a spongiform pustule, compatible with pustular psoriasis.
A blood test was performed, including serology in case it was necessary to start systemic treatment, which showed an RPR 1/128, HAART + and HIV -.
Once the analytical results were received, it was decided to perform immunohistochemical staining for treponemes in the skin biopsies, which showed positivity for this microorganism in the lower part of the epithelium.

Diagnosis
Secondary pustular syphilis.

Treatment
Penicillin G benzine 2.4 MU, 1 single dose.

Evolution
The pustular lesions as well as the rash resolved progressively without scarring. The psoriasis outbreak was acceptably controlled with phototherapy (UVB-Be) and topical corticotherapy.
