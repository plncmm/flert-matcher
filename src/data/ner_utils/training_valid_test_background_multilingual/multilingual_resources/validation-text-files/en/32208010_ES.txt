A 59-year-old woman from Wuhan was admitted to our hospital after 4 days of recurrent fever. Her highest temperature had been 38.8°C before admission, accompanied by headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting; she reported no chills, cough or muscle pain. She had resided in Wuhan for many years and had a history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. The patient also had a history of chronic gastritis. Prior to admission, the Guangzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Initial laboratory tests also showed a low white blood cell count (3.06 × 109/L; normal range: 3.50-9.50 × 109/L) and lymphocytopenia (0.68 × 109/L; normal range: 1.10-3.20 × 109/L). A chest CT scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities, which were considered indicative of viral pneumonia. Based on the history and tests, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.

After admission, the patient showed recurrent fever up to 38.6°C with chills, cough with little white expectoration, nasal congestion, chest discomfort and dyspnoea on exertion. Laboratory tests showed that C-reactive protein values gradually increased, while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count decreased. Initially, the patient was given antiviral and anti-infective treatment. Six days after admission, the patient showed marked dyspnoea, her oxygen saturation decreased and her oxygenation was 169 (< 300). A thoracic CT scan showed multiple bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities with imprecise boundaries and essentially subpleural distribution. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing was negative and CT showed diffuse consolidations in both lungs. No pleural effusion or mediastinal adenopathy was observed. Lung lesions showed a clear worsening and enlargement. The diagnosis was changed to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Treatment was immediately changed to high frequency ventilation and administration of human immunoglobulin and teicoplanin.

After 9-11 days, the patient's temperature returned to normal but cough and haemoptotic expectoration worsened. However, C-reactive protein values decreased, while the leukocyte formula and lymphocyte count gradually increased; in addition, the SARS-CoV-2 test was negative. CT showed enlargement of lesions with increased attenuation. Some ground-glass opacities had developed into consolidations. The patient's symptoms were improving, but imaging tests showed a worsening. The physician suspected a delay in the presentation of imaging changes.

With a set of effective treatments on days 12, 17 and 21 after admission, detection of SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swabs was negative. Chest CT scans showed clear uptake of the lesions and a subpleural line. The patient's symptoms improved and the nucleic acid tests remained negative for SARS-CoV-2, so she was released from quarantine and discharged.

In this case, we observed the dynamic changes of severe COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT scans. In the early phase of the disease, CT showed multiple ground-glass or patchy opacities with subpleural distribution in several bilateral lobes, characteristic of signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT. As the pneumonia progressed, the CT scan showed that, within a few days, areas of lesions in the lungs increased in size and developed into diffuse consolidations in both lungs. Even when the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative and the patient's symptoms subsided, there was a delay in the CT changes and evidence of absorption of the lesions. During the absorption period, the patchy lung consolidations decreased and gradually absorbed, but the subpleural line was still present. Dynamic chest CT has a very relevant role in the diagnosis and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
