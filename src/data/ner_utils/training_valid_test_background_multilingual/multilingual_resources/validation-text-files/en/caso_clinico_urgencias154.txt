A 72-year-old woman, with no personal history and no pharmacological treatment, attended the emergency department with a tumour of sudden onset, of 4 days' evolution, in the right parotid region, without any associated symptoms, without fever or symptoms of neurological deficit. The ultrasound showed a 3 x 2 cm tumour, right preauricular, soft, well-defined and pulsatile. A cervical ultrasound was performed, and a tumour measuring 3 x 2 cm was visualised in the right facial region, adjacent to the temporomandibular joint, with the morphology of a vascular structure and with colour Doppler flow, dependent on the external carotid artery. She was assessed by the on-call facial maxillofacial surgeon and admitted to the ward to complete the study. A cerebral angiography was performed, in which a high-flow superficial AV fistula was detected, irrigated by the right posterior atrial aorta, with no other associated vascular malformations. It was selectively embolised by the interventional radiology service and was excluded in the final check-up. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for post-catheterisation observation and was discharged to the ward 24 hours later. She progressed favourably on the ward and was discharged home 48 hours later. She was re-evaluated in the maxillofacial outpatient clinic (CCEE) one month and three months later, with good evolution and improvement of the lesion. She was studied in the internal medicine department, where, after performing complementary tests and a biopsy of dermal skin lesions, the diagnosis of NF type I was made.
