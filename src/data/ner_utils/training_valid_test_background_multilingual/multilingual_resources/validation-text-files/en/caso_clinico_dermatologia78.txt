This is a 70-year-old man from Norte de Santander, from Bogot√°, with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia diagnosed 5 years earlier and chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the cirrhotic phase, who consulted the emergency department in very poor general condition, with dyspnoea and anasarca. In addition to the above, she had undergone clipping of a cerebral aneurysm, appendectomy and ligation of oesophageal varices.

During his hospitalisation, lesions were observed on the lower limbs, which were asymptomatic and of progressive extension. Consultation with the dermatology department was requested and papules and erythematous-violaceous plaques were observed on the inner thighs. On the front of the left leg there was a violaceous macule with phlyctena from which a biopsy was taken. The diagnostic impression was that of a vasculitic process.

The biopsy revealed skin with epidermis of usual appearance. In the dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue, stromal cells with prominent and irregular nuclei and an acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate with leukocytoclastic phenomena and extravasation of red blood cells were found. In addition, dilated dermal blood vessels were found with prominent and irregular endothelial cells, some of them with hyperchromatic nuclei. PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) staining was negative for fungi. Immunohistochemistry for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed, which strongly highlighted the previously described large endothelial and stromal cells. These findings led to the diagnosis of a viral cutaneous infectious process due to cytomegalovirus.
During hospitalisation, the patient presented with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with hepatic encephalopathy and prerenal hyper- azoaemia due to dehydration and severe anaemia. The patient was managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and support, however he presented a torpid evolution and died two days later, without having started antiviral treatment.
