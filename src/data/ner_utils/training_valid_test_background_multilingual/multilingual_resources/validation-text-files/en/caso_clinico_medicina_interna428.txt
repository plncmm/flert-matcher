A 26-year-old man was admitted to Internal Medicine for acute renal failure and altered liver function tests. He works in a workshop and has no medical or surgical history of interest. He regularly attends the gym and acknowledges the use of protein and vitamin supplements, which he discontinued the week prior to admission. He denies the use of toxic substances.
Four days prior to admission, the patient began with generalised myalgias and intermittent fever of up to 39oC, associated with choluric urine and nausea. On the day of admission, he presented with diffuse abdominal pain, which led him to the Emergency Department. He was haemodynamically stable, and the physical examination was unremarkable, with only slight pain on general abdominal palpation.
The first blood test showed significant elevation of transaminases (AST 4064 U/L, ALT 4064 U/L) and acute renal failure (urea 93 mg/dL, creatinine 4.05 mg/dL, GFR 19 ml/min/1.73m2). With these results and the patient's clinical presentation, a rapid test for influenza virus detection was requested, and the results were positive for Influenza A virus, as well as for CK and CKMB, with figures of 127,530 U/L and 1,680 U/L respectively.
In view of these findings, he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close surveillance and monitoring, and progressed well with abundant hydration, urinary alkalinisation and oseltamivir, with progressive improvement in renal and hepatic function and gradual decrease in CK and CKMB levels, without requiring renal replacement therapy. At discharge, he was asymptomatic and his laboratory tests were practically normal.
Influenza A virus-associated rhabdomyolysis is rarely described in the literature. This virus infects muscle cells, causing their destruction and consequently the elevation of muscle enzymes, leading to acute tubular necrosis responsible for renal damage. Exceptionally, as in our case, there may be hypertransaminasemia, and this elevation should not be confused with acute liver damage. Although our patient did not require renal replacement therapy, it is sometimes necessary to apply it temporarily until renal failure is resolved.
