A 54-year-old man with no toxic habits or epidemiological history of interest, who had consulted a year earlier for recurrent episodes of high fever (38-39°), in periods of 2-3 days, with occasional shivering and polyarthralgias with polyarthritis at different levels (distal interphalangeal joints, wrists, ankles...), which responded to paracetamol. The immunological and serological study was negative, and the thoraco-abdominal CT scan was normal. He was assessed by Rheumatology who, after a genetic study and confirmation of non-response to colchicine, ruled out autoinflammatory syndrome of the familial Mediterranean fever type and started trial treatment with steroids with partial improvement.
After a new episode of more than 10 days of fever over 39°, shivering with night sweats and arthritis of large and small joints in both upper and lower limbs, this time with a general syndrome and weight loss of about 7 kilos, he was admitted to internal medicine. A new thoracic-abdominal CT scan was requested, which showed splenomegaly of about 16 cm and large lymphadenopathies of up to 2 cm in the mesentery, grouped together to form a large conglomerate from the pancreatic area to the aorto-iliac bifurcation, so a laparotomy was performed to obtain biopsies. The mycobacterial culture was negative and histology showed clusters of histiocytes, many with foamy cytoplasm and the presence of PAS (+) material, resistant to the action of diastase and Ziehl (-), surrounded by lymphocytes, plasma cells and some eosinophils, with a positive PCR for Tropheryma whippelii. After starting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, she experienced a rapid symptomatic improvement, and the treatment was maintained for a year with complete remission of symptoms and disappearance of the lymphadenopathies.
