A 79-year-old woman was taken to the emergency department for decreased level of consciousness, with no response to stimuli. History of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, coronary stent, pacemaker, anticoagulated AF, anaemia and normal colonoscopy. His relatives reported deterioration for three months, up to bed rest, frequent headache, pain in the lower limbs, and behavioural alteration. She presented with obnubilation and temporo-spatial disorientation, with no neurological localisation. Laboratory tests showed plateletopenia, increased CK levels, and the rest was normal. The CT scan of the skull without contrast showed scattered calcifications of cortico-extraaxial location, not present in the previous CT scan six months earlier, and which were initially interpreted as an inconsequential finding. A more detailed analysis showed the presence of vasogenic oedema associated with a dominant tentorial calcification, so a CT scan with contrast was performed, which showed discrete nodular enhancement associated with the calcifications.
Meningeal carcinomatosis and neurocysticercosis were established as diagnostic possibilities (calcifications 8 months after primary infection and oedema in neurocysticercosis may help in the differential diagnosis). CSF cytology diagnosed adenocarcinoma. Body CT scan detected a small bowel tumour and pulmonary metastases.
