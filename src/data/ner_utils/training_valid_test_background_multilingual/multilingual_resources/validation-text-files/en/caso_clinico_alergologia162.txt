A 7-year-old male patient with a history of atopic dermatitis, debuted with urticaria and angioneurotic oedema after eating omelettes and fish at 12 months of age. At 3 years: IgE 360IU/ml, Ovomucoid 1.61kU/L, Clear 14.5kU/L, Ovalbumin 15.61kU/L, Cod 10.4kU/L, Tuna 21.4kU/L, Hake 7.24kU/L, Sole 6.47kU/L. Prick > 3 Clear, Ovomucoid and Ovalbumin. Oral provocation test (PPO) to boiled egg was negative, so a diet with boiled egg 3 times a week and no fish was indicated. Subsequently the patient reported urticaria after eating melon, prick test was performed: LTP 5/6, Profilina 0/6, Clara 8/6, Yolk 5/6, Egg 2/6, Ovalbumin 2/6, Ovomucoid 4/6, Melon 2/6, Cod 10/6, Sole 10/6, Hake 10/6, Hake 10/6.

A PPO of omelette was performed, which was positive, so a diet of boiled egg, free of melon and fish was indicated. At 7 years of age, the patient presented with food impaction, an oesophago-gastric endoscopy was performed, showing evidence of > 40 (eos/hpf). Fluticasone swallowed 250mcg BID + Omeprazole, a diet free of eggs, fish and melon was prescribed.

The present case could suggest the involvement of EoE with the reintroduction of allergenic foods, therefore strict follow-up of patients consuming allergenic foods after OIT is recommended.
