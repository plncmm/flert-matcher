50-year-old male, no known drug allergies, ex-smoker for 7 years, with an accumulated consumption of 30 pack-years and no other accompanying toxic habits. His personal history includes very poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with target organ involvement (nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; amputation of several phalanges in the lower limbs (MMII)). Of note is a previous admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in 2010 with clinical judgement at discharge of pneumonia and diabetic ketoacidosis complicated by secondary septic shock. The usual treatment consisted of insulin glargine 30 IU/day, insulin aspart according to daily needs and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day.
The patient was taken to hospital when found unconscious at home by relatives. He had not been taking insulin for three days by his own decision. For 48 hours, the patient had been complaining of thirst, nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed a poor general condition with a severe decrease in the level of consciousness (Glasgow score 9/15) as well as dryness and mucocutaneous pallor. He was eupneic at rest with an oxygen saturation of 98% with 2-litre nasal goggles, with BP 74/47 mmHg, bradycardic at 48 beats per minute (bpm) and afebrile. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal. No significant adenopathies were palpable. There was no oedema or signs of peripheral venous thrombosis in the lower limbs or skin lesions.
The following complementary tests were performed: electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 50 bpm, with no alterations in the QRS or repolarisation. The haemogram showed 12,300 leukocytes per microlitre and 88% neutrophils; the rest of the series were normal. Biochemistry was remarkable: glycaemia of 1083 mg/dl with glycated haemoglobin at 9.3%; acute renal failure with creatinine at 4 mg/dl (glomerular filtration rate 16 mL/min/1.73m2); severe hyponatraemia (116 mEq/L), normal potassium at 5.5 mEq/L, elevated CPK (9700 U/L), CRP at 11.8 mg/L and procalcitonin at 12 ng/ml. The coagulation study was normal. HIV serology was negative. Urine systemic analysis showed ketonuria and marked glycosuria with positive ketone bodies (50mg/dl). Urine toxicology was negative. Venous blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with pH <6.8, pCO2 32 mmHg, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L and lactate at 15.2 mmol/L. Posteroanterior and lateral chest X-ray showed a well-defined alveolar infiltrate at the right base, with blurring of the cardiac border. In the right upper lobe there was a less dense and more diffuse infiltrate. There was no associated pleural effusion. Simple helical computed tomography (CT) of the skull showed no significant alterations.
The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and suspected aspiration pneumonia. Intensive treatment was administered with fluid therapy, insulin perfusion and ertapenem 1g/24 hours intravenous (iv). A BAS was performed by flexible bronchoscopy (FBB) and a new chest X-ray showed a new alveolar infiltrate, nodular in appearance, in the left upper lobe. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was then requested, showing multiple nodules in the lungs, some cavitated, measuring up to 18-20 mm, in both lung fields, predominantly in the upper lobes and more significantly in the left lobe, some of them located in the periphery, but predominantly randomly distributed. There was also a small bilateral pleural effusion, minimal in the left hemithorax. Abdominal examination revealed no significant findings.

Differential diagnosis
For the differential diagnosis we have to evaluate diseases that cause cavitary lesions in the lung. Some of them would be:
1. neoplasms: Primary lung tumours are usually single cavitated, spiculated lesions with thick, irregular walls. They are frequently associated with soft tissue involvement or other findings such as lymphadenopathy, mediastinal invasion or infiltration of the chest wall. In addition, they are usually chronic processes (>12 weeks). The acute onset of our picture, as well as the multiple involvement, does not lead us to consider this option as a first possibility. Neither does the option of metastasis, given that there is no evidence of a primary tumour in the thoracic-abdominal CT scan and its presentation is also chronic. Some types of lymphoma can also present with cavitated lesions, however our patient did not present with symptoms or lymphadenopathy, findings highly suggestive of this entity. Another possibility would be Kaposi's sarcoma, but this is typical of patients with HIV infection and in the presence of skin lesions, both features absent in this case, and therefore we do not consider this option.
2. autoimmune pathology: This includes a group of pathologies that can produce, albeit rarely, pulmonary lesions similar to those in our case. We must mainly rule out granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis), which is a necrotising systemic vasculitis with involvement of the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract and kidneys. The form of presentation is usually chronic and progressive; therefore, the abruptness with which the clinical manifestations in our patient, with a decrease in the level of consciousness, deviates us from this entity. Sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis as when pulmonary nodules appear they can cavitate. The most frequent form of presentation is usually through hilar adenopathies which do not exist in our patient, just as he does not present clinical, analytical alterations (hypercalcaemia, ACE) or radiological involvement (interstitial pneumopathy) compatible with sarcoidosis.
3. pulmonary embolism: Pulmonary embolism of vascular origin cavitates exceptionally in 7% of cases, so it is unlikely to be the cause of our clinical case. Pulmonary cavitations also occur in cases of septic pulmonary embolism. They could be a possibility to be taken into account as they present acutely as multiple small nodules, peripherally and subpleurally located, as in our patient. However, the absence of fever and murmurs on cardiac auscultation, as well as the absence of the typical aetiology of this entity (bacterial endocarditis, drug addiction by parenteral route, patients with pacemakers or septic thrombophlebitis) do not favour suspicion.
4. infectious pathology: Most cavitated lung lesions arise as a complication of aspiration pneumonia, caused by anaerobic germs, in patients with a predisposing factor such as a low level of consciousness. This was our initial main suspicion, but lack of response to empirical treatment with ertapenem 1g/24 hours iv ruled out this option. Many other bacteria can cause lung cavitations, but do so less frequently and also often respond to ertapenem treatment: Klebsiella pneumoniae causes severe necrotising pneumonia that often coalesces into a large cavity and leads to pulmonary gangrene; and Staphylococcus aureus often causes multilobar consolidation, pleural effusion and empyema, and is associated with cavitations in 27% of cases. Therefore, infections secondary to antibiotic-resistant bacterial organisms had to be considered. Infection secondary to Actinomyces sp is associated with poor oral hygiene and is most frequently located on the skin of the face and neck. Nocardia sp infection mainly affects immunocompromised patients with deficient cell-mediated immunity. These reasons led us to rule out these infections in our patient. As for mycobacterial infection, in more than 90% of cases, it corresponds to reactivation of a latent infection, with a chronic onset, unlike our patient, who developed acutely. Furthermore, the clinical manifestations (absence of lymphadenopathy and haemoptysis) and epidemiology do not lead us to this diagnosis as a first possibility. The lack of response to empirical antibiotherapy in a poorly controlled diabetic patient with pulmonary cavitations leads us to suspect infections secondary to opportunistic fungi (aspergillosis and mucormycosis) as the first possibility. Pneumonia secondary to Aspergillus sp occurs in neutropenic patients who have received multiple courses of antibiotics or in patients with chronic corticotherapy, findings not present in our patient. Mucor sp infection, however, occurs in patients similar to our case, with diabetes mellitus and poor metabolic control with diabetic ketoacidosis. Although its most common involvement is rhino-orbital-cerebral, it can also cause pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement in others. Pulmonary mucormycosis presents as a very severe and rapidly progressive nodular pneumopathy, with a high probability of cavitation. This is largely consistent with our clinical case and therefore heads our differential diagnosis.

Evolution
In view of the results of the chest CT scan, liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day iv was added to the treatment. After bronchoaspirate (BAS), Mucor sp was isolated and the culture showed broad, non-septate hyphae with irregular branching, so liposomal amphotericin B was maintained. CT scan ruled out brain and ENT involvement by Mucor. During his admission to the ICU he required orotracheal intubation for 9 days and remained unstable for the first 72 hours, recovering after administration of noradrenaline. On the twelfth day, the patient was stable with normal renal function, no acidosis and glycaemia at 203 mg/dl, for which he was transferred to the Infectious Diseases ward. At no time did he present any clinical signs of pulmonary involvement. During his hospitalisation, the clinical and analytical evolution was favourable with liposomal amphotericin B for a total of 40 days (normalisation of blood glucose and pH). Radiological evolution was slower, with a slight decrease in pulmonary lesions. On discharge, treatment with oral posaconazole (300 mg/day) was continued due to the persistence, to a lesser extent, of the pulmonary lesions.
The patient continued to be seen at the Infectious Diseases Clinic with negative Mucor isolation in respiratory samples and completed treatment with posaconazole for 12 months until the pulmonary infiltrates were completely resolved.

Final diagnosis
