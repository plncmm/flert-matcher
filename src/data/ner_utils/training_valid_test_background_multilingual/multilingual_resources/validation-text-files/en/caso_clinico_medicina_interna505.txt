A 20-year-old woman was referred for ultrasound findings of bilateral parenchymal nephropathy with nephrocalcinosis and cortico-medullary microcysts. Personal history included moderate mental retardation, conduct disorder, hyperuricaemia and metabolic syndrome treated with allopurinol, statins and ACE inhibitors. A paediatrician's report noted nephromegaly at birth, with normal renal function and sediment, but kidneys already hyperechogenic on ultrasound. Among the family history, the maternal grandmother had chronic kidney disease. In the anamnesis, the patient denies renoureteral colic, haematuria and NSAID intake, and has had some uncomplicated UTIs. Physical examination was normal except for type I obesity.
Laboratory tests showed Cr 1.14 mg/dl with eGFR 69.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (already present in previous cases), hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia, elevated GGT and urine sediment with >100 leukocytes/field, without nitrites or bacteriuria (persistently). A recent urine study was completed (CAC 36 mg/g and CPC 0.130 g/g) and 24h urine (proteinuria 540 mg/24h and albumin 320. 2 mg/24h) and a study of possible causes of nephrocalcinosis (primary hyperparathyroidism, ATRD, hypercalciuria) and lithiasis with Ca2+, P, 25-OHVitD, PTH, venous gasometry, urine pH, calciuria, oxalate, citrate, phosphaturia, RTP and uricosuria, which were normal. Abdominal CT scan ruled out lithiasis. CKDG2A2 was suspected due to probable chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (CIN) due to persistent sterile pyuria. A urine culture, Mantoux and serology were completed to rule out infectious causes; a proteinogram and light chains to rule out infiltration; ANA and ENA to rule out CINT secondary to Sj√∂gren's syndrome and RCT and chest X-ray for the possibility of sarcoidosis; the results were normal. After ruling out other causes and given the family history, hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia and bilateral cortico-medullary microcysts, autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial nephropathy (ADTN) was considered as a possible diagnosis. The genetic study confirms the diagnosis of microdeletion/microduplication 17q/12 syndrome of maternal origin with intellectual deficit and NTID due to deletion of the HNF1B gene. This syndrome is rare and is characterised by bilateral cortical renal cysts, renal hyperechogenicity in the foetal and neonatal period, hypomagnesaemia, hyperuricaemia, altered liver function tests, Mody 5 type DM, pancreatic atrophy, genitourinary anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders.
