Anamnesis
A 23-year-old woman with a personal history of congenital heart disease operated on in childhood and Darier's disease confirmed by genetic study. Family history of Darier's disease in the father. She had been under dermatology control for years, treated with 25 mg a day of acitretin, photoprotection and short courses of topical corticosteroids in the event of an occasional worsening of the symptoms.
She consulted the dermatology emergency department for presenting an intense, very pruritic and painful erythematous rash, mainly on the neckline, face and armpits, which had been present for six days. The clinical picture did not respond to topical corticotherapy and progressively worsened over the days.

Physical examination
Physical examination revealed multiple erythematous papules and plaques, some of which were erosive and exudative, located on the neckline, submammary region, neck and armpits.
No alterations were observed on mucous membranes. Nails with reddish-white longitudinal striations, slight thinning of the nail plate with V-shaped indentation of the distal edge and subungual haemorrhages.
The patient did not present fever, but was in a very poor general state of health and was in poor health.

Complementary examinations
A haemogram, ionogram, renal function, liver function and cultures for bacteria and herpes were performed. The results of the blood tests showed no abnormalities except for leukocytosis of 14.21x109/L with a left shift. Bacterial culture was negative, however, herpes culture was positive for herpes simplex type 1.

Diagnostic orientation
Kaposi's varicelliform rash (KVR) in a patient with Darier's disease.

Treatment
Due to the patient's severe malaise and pruritus it was decided to admit her to hospital for further monitoring and treatment. Treatment was started with valacyclovir 500 mg every 12 hours for 5 days in addition to potassium permanganate fomentation 1:20,000 and topical treatment with clindamycin 1%.

Evolution
The patient progressed satisfactorily with improvement in pain and pruritus and resolution of the skin lesions, for which reason she was discharged on the fourth day. At the outpatient check-up in 7 days the lesions were practically resolved.
