Clinical history. Anamnesis
A 34-year-old male patient of Bulgarian origin, with a history of hepatitis C and former cocaine user 4 years ago. He consulted for 5 days of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea, accompanied by fever (the last two days) and pain in the left lower limb. Doppler echocardiography of the lower limbs and thoracic CT scan were performed, which led to the diagnosis of DVT in the lower limb, bilateral PTE and cavitated pulmonary nodules suggestive of septic embolism as the first aetiological option, without being able to rule out vasculitis and less likely a neoplastic process. In view of the above, it was decided to admit him to the ICU. After clinical stabilisation, he was transferred to Internal Medicine. During his stay on the ward, he presented with acute generalised pustular exanthema predominantly on the trunk and MMSS associated with fever and leukocytosis. He was assessed jointly with dermatology and samples were taken for biopsy and culture.

Physical examination
BP: 120/70 mmHg, HR: 90 bpm, Temperature: 37.8oc, Oxygen saturation of 100% with ventimask mask at 50%. Oral cavity: whitish lesion on the left side of the tongue.
CYC: Left retroauricular and axillary adenopathies. Chest: AC: rhythmic tones without audible murmurs. AP: Conserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or visceromegaly. Positive hydro-aerial sounds. Pain on palpation in the right hypochondrium. No signs of peritonism. Extremities: increased perimeter of the lower extremities. Palpable peripheral pulses. Bilateral inguinal adenopathies, the largest in the left inguinal area measuring 1 cm, adherent to deep planes, painless on palpation. Skin: generalised papulo-pustular lesions predominantly on the limbs with a firm erythematous base and some with crusting.

Complementary tests
Blood count: Leukocytes 20.6 thousands/mcL (Polymorphonuclear 86%), Hb: 12 g/dl, platelets: 233 thousands/mcL. ESR: 120 mm. Coagulation study: Prothrombin activity: 61%, ATTP: 32 sec. Fibrinogen: 874 mg/dl. Biochemistry Gluc: 99 mg/dl, Urea:17 mg/d, Creatinine:0.5 mg/d, Total Bilirubin:0.5 mg/d, GOT:17 UI/L, GPT:33 UI/L, CPK:110 UI/L. Na:137 mmol/L, K:3.2 mmol/L. Ca:8.7 mmol/L, Phosphorus:4.4 mmol/L, Magnesium:2.2 mmol/L. Mantoux: 0 mm of induration. Iron profile: Fe: 8 mcg/dL, Ferritin: 851 ng/ml, Folic acid: 3.1 pg/ml. Autoimmunity: ANA, ANCA negative, Complement normal. Serology: HAV (-), HBV (past infection), HCV (positive) with undetectable viral load. HIV (-). Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Coxiella Burnetti and Brucella Negative. Blood culture: positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Transthoracic echocardiogram: preserved LVEF. No alterations in cavities or at valvular level. No pericardial effusion. No data of endocarditis. Inguinal adenopathy biopsy culture: Aerobes (-). BAAR stain (-). Induced sputum culture: BAAR (x3) Negative.

Differential diagnosis
- Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis.
- Gianotti-Crosti syndrome or acral papular dermatitis.
- Neutrophilic dermatosis: S. Sweet, Vasculitis.
- Results:- Pathological anatomy of cutaneous biopsy: Neutrophilic, pustular dermatitis and vasculitis. The alterations observed suggest a papulo-pustular lesion of Behçet's disease as a first possibility - Skin biopsy culture: Aerobic. BAAR stain negative.

Final diagnosis
Neutrophilic dermatosis in a patient with Behçet's disease.
