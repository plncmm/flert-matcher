Female patient, 60 years old, resident of Mexico City. She was admitted to the Hospital de Cardiología del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mexico City in February 2017, referred from another hospital with a diagnosis of probable IE. The patient presented with fever of unknown origin, intermittent, up to 39.7 °C, accompanied by diaphoresis and chills for 24 months of evolution, as well as vegetations on the aortic valve demonstrated by echocardiography. According to Duke's criteria, it was concluded that he had IE of aetiology to be determined. He had a smoking rate of 1.5 packs/year, occasional alcoholism without becoming intoxicated and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in 2012, treated with chloroquine 150 mg/24 hours, prednisone 2.5 mg/24 hours and cyclosporine 100 mg/24 hours.

At the Cardiology Hospital, the following studies were performed: transthoracic echocardiography (TTEE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TTEE), corroborating the existence of two vegetations on the aortic valve smaller than 10 mm in diameter; scintigraphy and scintigraphy studies demonstrated the presence of hepato-splenomegaly. Laboratory tests including blood biometry, blood chemistry, coagulation times, blood grouping, immunology and blood cultures showed the following results: normocytic normochromic anaemia ranging from 8 to 11. 3 g/dL, persistent thrombocytopenia (48 and 122 x 103/μL), leukopenia ranging from 2 to 3.8 x 103/μL, prothrombin time prolongation ranging from 7 to 28.7 seconds, partial thromboplastin time prolongation ranging from 9 to 118.2 seconds, positive anti-toxoplasma IgG and anti-cytomegalovirus IgG. All other studies were within normal reference ranges.

Three blood cultures processed by the BacT/ALERT® 3D system were performed and showed no microbiological growth. Although the blood cultures processed by the automated method were negative, and because of clinical and imaging suspicion of IE, according to the treatment criteria for intracardiac vegetations (< 10 mm), the patient was managed with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and amikacin for 14 days.

At the control ECTT performed at the end of February, it was observed that the vegetations had increased in diameter: one measured 14 x 8 mm and the other 4 x 5 mm, so in March 2017 she underwent vegectomy and biological aortic valve implantation. The patient was discharged from the Cardiology Hospital in April 2017, with treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as acetylsalicylic acid and metoprolol.

During his in-hospital stay, as part of a research protocol, a manual blood culture was performed using the lysis-centrifugation method, which, according to previous publications, increases the isolation of fungi. From the sediment obtained with this technique, a white, filamentous, cottony colony developed, whose direct examination with cotton blue showed septate hyaline filaments, with vesicular cells in chains, without conidia; in the microscopic examination of the subculture, the same structures were observed.

In the absence of morphological structures to guide identification, molecular biology procedures were used. DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (ExgeneTM Plant SV, Gene All, Biotechnology CO, Korea), following the manufacturer's instructions. By PCR, the ITS-D1D2 region was amplified with primers ITS1 (5"-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3") and ITS4 (5"-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATATGC-3"). PCR was performed with 100 ng of DNA; denaturation temperature of 96 °C for 5 minutes; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 30 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The amplification product was 620 base pairs (bp), which was purified and sequenced. The sequence received was compared in the Genebank database, resulting in 100% identity with Histoplasma capsulatum (Sequence ID: KX646015.1). It is important to mention that the fungal development of the blood culture with the lysis-centrifugation technique occurred after the patient's discharge.

Histopathological study of the vegetations, with PAS and Grocott stains, performed by the Department of Pathological Anatomy of the Cardiology Hospital, showed the presence of two types of fungal structures: yeasts of 2 to 3 μm in diameter and septate, tortuous filaments of approximately 5 μm in diameter and variable length. Given the evidence of H. capsulatum IE, the patient was treated with itraconazole, 300 mg/day. To date, quarterly check-ups have shown no alterations suggesting persistence of the infection.
