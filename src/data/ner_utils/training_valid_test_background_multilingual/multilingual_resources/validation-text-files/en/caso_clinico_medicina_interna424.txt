71-year-old male with no known drug allergies or toxic habits. Personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, chronic stable ischaemic heart disease, right periinsular ischaemic stroke, normal LVEF and IgG multiple myeloma in early progression. On chronic treatment with calcium carbonate 600 mg, risedronic acid 5 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg, nitroglycerin patches 15 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, linagliptin 5 mg and solifenacin/tamsulosin 6/0.4 mg.
The patient presented with pain in the left maxilla of one week's duration, without fever and without other additional symptoms. Physical examination was unremarkable except for the finding of exposure of the left maxillary bone. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytes 14000/uL, neutrophils 70% and CRP 12 mg/dl. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. The first suspicion was of maxillary osteonecrosis secondary to treatment with bisphosphonates, so a CT scan of the face and paranasal sinuses was requested, showing a lytic lesion with some sclerotic areas in the left upper maxillary bone, extending to the left maxillary sinus, which was reduced in size and occupied by soft tissue density material (see attached image). Subsequently, the patient was referred to maxillofacial surgery for surgical excision of the lesion in the left upper jaw and during surgery a biopsy was taken for pathological anatomy. The biopsy found "sulphur granules" composed of microorganisms compatible with Actinomyces israelii, so we are dealing with a case of actinomycosis in a patient with osteonecrosis of the left maxilla.
After surgery, the patient remained afebrile and haemodynamically stable. Intravenous penicillin was administered for 2 weeks with good clinical response. After discharge from hospital, the patient was treated with oral amoxicillin for 6 months and reviewed at the outpatient clinic.
Actinomyces israelii is a gram-positive bacillus that is part of the oropharyngeal and colonic flora. Due to the increased use of bisphosphonates, the prevalence of maxillary or mandibular osteonecrosis has increased in recent years. In addition, as a peculiarity of this case, the patient develops a secondary actinomycosis.
