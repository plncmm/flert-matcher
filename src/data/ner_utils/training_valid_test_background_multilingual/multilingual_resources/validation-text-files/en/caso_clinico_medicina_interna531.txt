A 32-year-old man presented to the emergency department at the end of September with intermittent fever of up to 41oC in the afternoon and arthromyalgia lasting a week, treated with antipyretics and, in the 48h prior to consultation, onset of respiratory symptoms consisting of cough with expectoration and haemoptysis.
His most relevant personal history included an adverse reaction to metamizole, smoking, marijuana and inhaled cocaine use, vitiligo, repeated bronchial episodes and an unaffiliated personality disorder. He was treated with dipotassium chlorazepate, gabapentin, quetiapine, mirtazapine, paroxetine and ipratropium bromide. From the epidemiological point of view, inhabitant of Villafranco del Guadalquivir, crayfish fisherman, ex-convict, sexual relations with different partners, always using barrier methods.
On arrival at the emergency department he presented with BP 150/90mmHg, HR 81lpm, Ta 38.8oC, good general condition, frank non-threatening haemoptysis, slight mucocutaneous pallor, absence of lymphadenopathy, erosions and scarring skin excoriations on the lower limbs, scattered wheezing and slight crackles at the bases, and a normal neurological and abdominal examination.
Initial complementary tests showed an extensive bilateral alveolar-interstitial infiltrate on chest X-ray; haemoglobin of 11.7g/dL with normochromia-normocytosis and absence of liver or renal metabolic abnormalities in blood tests and negative smear tests and antigenuria.
The patient was admitted under empirical broad-spectrum antibiotherapy and during the first few days he continued with haemoptysis, anaemisation of up to 4 points and dyspnoea with the need for supplementary oxygen therapy. Given the suspicion of pulmonary haemorrhage, even with an open differential diagnosis, it was decided to start steroid pulses (1g methylprednisolone/24h). The evolution after this and finally, the results of the HRCT (alveolar haemorrhage) and serology (positive IgM for L. interrogans) were diagnostic of leptospirosis with pulmonary capillaritis.
This case teaches us, on the one hand, the importance of epidemiological anamnesis and, on the other hand, that in the eternal doubt between infectious and autoimmune aetiology, in severe cases, we should not skimp on aggressive treatment, even with immunosuppressants, as they acutely improve the prognosis of most severe infections.
