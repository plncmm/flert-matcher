A 52-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with a positive Philadephia chromosome undergoing chemotherapy with lamivudine presented during his third induction cycle with Trichosporon asahii fungaemia which was treated with intravenous amphotericin B. The fever resolved and the patient was discharged. The febrile symptoms resolved, although seeding persisted in the liver and lung, detected by computed tomography as disseminated calcified lesions. In addition, the patient had maculo-papular skin lesions that were biopsied and found to be positive for Trichosporon asahii.
Nine months after the diagnosis of acute ALL, the patient presented with ocular symptoms manifested as bilateral blurred vision. Visual acuity (VA) was 0.9 in both eyes and biomicroscopy showed a normal examination for his age. Fundus examination showed a mild bilateral vitritis (1+) and several scattered yellowish chorioretinal lesions located at the peripapillary level and at the posterior pole in both eyes.
Fluorescein angiography was performed, which revealed the activity of the lesions. It showed early hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence in the choroiditis foci.
After a systemic study ruled out other causes of chorioretinitis, the appearance of the lesions1 and the history of Trichosporon asahii fungaemia associated with persistent seeding in the liver and lung led to a presumptive diagnosis of Trichosporon choroiditis.
The therapeutic approach was carried out in agreement with the Haematology Department, which required eradication of the fungus from all foci in order to perform a bone marrow transplant on the patient. Empirical treatment was started with systemic and intravitreal voriconazole (0.25 Î¼g/0.1 ml) repeated on the third and sixth day in both eyes. Subsequently, a weekly injection was performed in each eye for two months. The response was satisfactory in the right eye, where all lesions were inactivated, but partial in the left eye, as inactivation of all foci was not achieved.
A change of treatment to intravitreal amphotericin B in the left eye was decided. After the injection, the patient developed aseptic endophthalmitis and required urgent vitrectomy 23 g. He also required cataract surgery. He also required cataract surgery two months after vitrectomy. Following these complications, and because his haematologist advised against bone marrow transplantation at that time, the patient refused to continue with any type of therapeutic procedure on his eyes.
After one year of follow-up, his VA was 1 in both eyes and activity persisted in one of the chorioretinal lesions in his left eye.
