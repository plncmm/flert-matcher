Anamnesis
A 28-year-old male patient with the only history of condyloma acuminata in the perianal and genital region was diagnosed with common acute lymphoid leukaemia (B-ALL). He initially received chemotherapy treatment, which was effective, until 9 years after diagnosis he presented a late relapse refractory to chemotherapy. As he had no HLA-identical siblings, a haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from his mother was performed. After the infusion, the patient began with urinary discomfort, a lesion on the glans penis and groin pain.

Physical examination
Necrotic penile skin. Ulcerated balanopreputial lesion, yellow-greenish in colour, with purulent exudate, painful on palpation. Inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Complementary tests
- Culture of the exudate: growth of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies.
- Blood cultures: growth of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies.
- Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): hyperintense signal in penile tissues, with destructuring of sheaths and presence of gas.

Diagnosis
Gangrenous balanopreputial ecthyma. Bacteraemia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Treatment
Antibiotic coverage with meropenem 1 g every 8 hours, intravenous. Life support measures in the Intensive Care Unit.
After systemic stabilisation, the patient was transferred to the ward, where he remained for a period of 3 weeks under treatment with local dressings, with unsatisfactory evolution. On the 52nd day post-infusion, extensive surgical debridement was performed, excising the entire necrotic skin surface, and an assessment of the resulting defect by Plastic Surgery was requested. The penis was found to be completely debrided, completely free of skin, with a purulent exudate, which remained positive for P. aeruginosa. Silver-based dressings (first with ointments and then dressings) are prescribed to clean the lesion with a view to surgery. The first choice was to cover the penis with a partial skin graft. Given the patient's haematological chimerism due to his maternal PHPT, this graft would have to come not from the patient but from his mother, in order to avoid a graft-versus-host reaction1 . On the 93rd day postinfusion, in simultaneous operating theatres, the thick partial skin graft from the maternal donor is harvested and, under spinal anaesthesia, implanted in the recipient as a single body graft with dorsal suture with 5/0 resorbable monofilament in the recipient. The implant is performed with traction of the penile shaft to its maximum extension and after suturing, a bandage is applied as a splinting device2-4.

Evolution
No complications occurred in the postoperative period, and once graft attachment was confirmed, the patient was discharged. The 6-month review showed total coverage of the penis with the graft, with no signs of rejection, with flexibility, no retraction and adequate functionality.
