Anamnesis
58-year-old patient with a personal history of bacterial endocarditis complicated with bacterial meningoencephalitis, discitis at D12-L1 level and left parietal ischaemic stroke in 2006, without sequelae, ex-smoker (3 packs/day).
In September 2011, he began to experience low back pain radiating to the anterior aspect of the right thigh, with little response to analgesic treatment, leading to several visits to the emergency department. Since January 2012, she had been experiencing progressive weakness in her right leg, requiring support with crutches for ambulation, and a feeling of ipsilateral numbness, especially when standing upright. In the last month, she also reported a feeling of numbness and weakness in her left leg when walking, which improved after resting. He reported no sphincter disturbances or other symptoms. The patient provided an electromyographic study (EMG), which revealed the presence of severe L4-L5 radicular distress with evidence of active denervation; and a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in October 2011, which showed mild degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1, with very discrete stenosis of the lateral recesses and foramina without signs of radicular involvement. MRI of the dorsal-lumbar spine in T2 sequence without contrast, in which a small D12-L1 disc protrusion can be seen, without causing alteration of the medullary signal. In view of the clinical-radiological dissociation and the torpid evolution of the clinical picture, the patient was admitted to the Neurology Department to complete the study.

Physical examination
Vital signs were normal. Normal head and neck, no palpable lymph nodes. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic, no murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, without masses or megaliths; there were no palpable inguinal adenopathies.

Neurological examination: atrophy of the right thigh. Global weakness in the right lower extremity, predominantly distal, with a foot drop. Weakness for dorsal flexion of the left foot. Muscle reflexes abolished in the right lower extremity and hypoactive in the left lower extremity. Bilateral flexor flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex. Normal sensory modalities. Bilateral Las√®gue's sign at 45o. Very difficult gait, bilateral steppage, predominantly on the right.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests with haemogram, biochemistry, HbA1, thyroid hormones: normal.
- Coagulation: fibrinogen 541 mg/dl.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 49 mm.
- Vitamin B12: 4,789 pg/ml. Folic acid: 1.9 ng/ml.
- Prostate specific antigen: negative.
- Immunological study: antinuclear antibodies 1/160, rest negative.
- Serology retrovirus, lupus, Borrelia, Brucella: negative. Herpes simplex virus serology: IgM negative, IgG positive.
- Cerebrospinal fluid study: leukocytes 165 cells/ul (mononuclear greater than 90%), glucose 61 mg/dl, protein 1.7 g/l.
- Cerebrospinal fluid cytology: lymphomonocytic pleocytosis. No evidence of atypical cells.
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm.
- Chest X-ray: no evidence of pleuropulmonary pathology.
- Spinal X-ray: evidence of D12-L1 disc disease.
- Electroneuromyogram (ENMG): evidence of active denervation in practically all the muscles explored in the lower limbs, except at left L4; in part of the muscles dependent on right C8 and in the lumbar paravertebral muscles, with neurogenic tracings or absence of PUM (right L5 root) on voluntary contraction of these muscles.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervico-dorso-lumbar spine without and with contrast: focal spinal cord lesion at the level of the L1 vertebral body, approximately 2 cm long and 8 mm thick, involving the anterior and central portion of the conus medullaris and extending widely over the pial surface of the anterior aspect. After contrast administration, it showed peripheral enhancement and central hypocaptation. It was associated with centromedullary oedema, extending from D11 to the conus medullaris and slight medullary expansion, although there appeared to be depression of the pial surface in the central area of the lesion. Doubtful intrathecal nodular lesion adjacent to the right S1 root. MRI of the dorsolumbar spine, T2 sequence without contrast with a spinal cord lesion at the level of the L1 vertebral body affecting the anterior and central portion of the conus medullaris. After contrast administration, it shows peripheral enhancement and central hypocaptation associated with spinal cord oedema.
- Laminectomy with lumbosacral root biopsy: metastasis of carcinoma. The immunohistochemical study showed immunopositivity for cytokeratin 7 and TTF1, suggesting lung adenocarcinoma metastasis as a first possibility.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT): subcarinal and right hilar necrotic lymphadenopathies were observed. Chronic bilateral basal pleural thickening. No lung parenchymal masses were demonstrated. Small bilateral renal cortical cortical cysts. Perirenal lipomatosis.

Diagnosis
Infiltration of the lumbosacral roots by metastatic carcinoma. Meningeal carcinomatosis.

Treatment and evolution
With the suspected diagnosis of lumbosacral plexopathy, the patient was admitted to the hospital to complete the diagnostic study, and analgesic treatment was initially administered. A battery of complementary tests was performed, including a spinal MRI study, which showed the presence of a spinal lesion associated with perilesional oedema and heterogeneous contrast uptake compatible with a neoplastic lesion, for which reason high doses of dexamethasone were associated with the treatment. The patient underwent surgery for biopsy and excision of the lesion. During the operation, a thickened, yellowish, granular lumbar root was observed, which was thinning at L1 and bifurcated at D12, and it was only possible to take a sample for histological study. With the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin (probably adenocarcinoma of the lung), the case was discussed with the Oncology Department to assess radiotherapy treatment. A few days later, without having started oncological treatment, the patient developed confusional symptoms with significant deterioration in general condition, and died shortly afterwards.
