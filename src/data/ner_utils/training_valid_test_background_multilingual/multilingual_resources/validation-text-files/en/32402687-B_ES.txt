A 32-year-old man, with no concomitant diseases or risk factors, was admitted to our emergency department on the 14th day since the onset of symptoms, with dry cough, asthenia, arthromyalgia, fever and right pleural pain. A baseline electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, 97 bpm, normal PR interval (120ms) and normal QRS complex (80ms), aQRS 0°. QTc (Friderica) 415 ms. No echocardiogram was performed, but the initial physical examination revealed blood pressure value 136/79 mmHg, regular rhythm without murmurs, distal pulse present and symmetrical and no signs of deep vein thrombosis. Laboratory tests showed elevated ferritin values (615 ng/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) = 3.6 mg/dL and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) (144.7 pg/mL). Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) 12seconds, international normalised ratio 1.1, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 28.2seconds. The test for lupus anticoagulant was positive. Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M were also negative. D-dimer values were elevated at 2460 ug/L and, because of suspected pulmonary thromboembolism, dual-energy CT pulmonary angiography (DCTPA) was performed. CTPA confirmed bilateral thromboembolism associated with multiple opacities, compatible with viral pneumonia. Iodine mapping imaging showed a peripheral triangular pulmonary infarction. 
The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine at an initial dose of 400 mg on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day for the next four days. He was also given azithromycin at 500 mg/day for 3 days and enoxaparin at 80 mg/12 h for 10 days. During admission, the patient showed clinical improvement without assisted ventilation and maintained an oxygen saturation around 97-99% on room air. On day 10 of admission, 24 days after the onset of symptoms, the patient was discharged in good health and asymptomatic. Given the positivity for lupus anticoagulant autoantibodies, a thrombophilia test will be performed in 3 months. He was prescribed a full anticoagulant regimen (80 mg/12 h) for 6 months.
