Anamnesis
A 54-year-old male smoker, under follow-up in urology for long-standing lower urinary tract symptoms treated with silodosin and diagnosed by cystoscopy with a 1.5 cm bladder neoplasm following an episode of haematuria. Treated by transurethral resection of the bladder, with a diagnosis of low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the lamina propria (T1G2).
After surgery, treatment began with endovesical instillations of bacillus Calmettte-Guérin (BCG) for 6 weeks, with good tolerance. After the seventh dose of BCG she began to develop fever, which persisted despite antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin and later with cefuroxime, for which reason she went to the emergency department. He reported afternoon febrile peaks of up to 39°C associated with asthenia, loss of 5 kg, cough and dyspnoea on exertion. No micturition syndrome or other accompanying symptoms.

Physical examination
Afebrile, haemodynamically stable. Oxygen saturation 95% at rest. Cardiopulmonary auscultation without alterations. Abdomen soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Negative bilateral renal fist percussion. Rectal examination: III/IV, adenomatous. Not suggestive of prostatitis.

Complementary tests
- Haemogram and blood biochemistry without significant alterations.
- Urine system: no relevant information.
- Fluorescein staining of urine (acid-fast bacilli): negative.
- Sputum smear microscopy negative.
- Chest X-ray: bilateral and nodular parenchymal involvement was observed, suggesting dissemination of miliary tuberculosis as a first possibility. No pleural or mediastinal alterations were observed.

Diagnosis
BCG-itis.

Treatment
Oral tuberculostatic antibiotic treatment was started with rifampicin (600 mg/day), isoniazid (300 mg/day) and ethambutol (500 mg/day).

Evolution
The patient was admitted to hospital to monitor the evolution of the clinical picture. During admission, he presented irritable urinary syndrome and episodes of night sweats without thermometric fever. As the fever disappeared and the clinical course was good, it was decided to discharge him from hospital and to continue with outpatient tuberculostatic antibiotic treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid until 6 months of treatment were completed and ethambutol until 2 months were completed.
In the subsequent follow-up at the clinic 4 weeks after discharge from hospital, the patient reported no recurrence of fever, although he occasionally presented slight fever and night sweats.
In order to monitor the possible side effects of the tuberculostatic treatment, periodic laboratory tests were requested, with no deterioration in liver function and a normal ocular fundus.
