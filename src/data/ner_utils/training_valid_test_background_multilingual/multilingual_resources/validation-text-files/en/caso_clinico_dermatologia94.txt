Anamnesis
We present the case of a 54-year-old man, with no pathological history of interest, who came to the clinic in August due to the appearance of pigmented lesions on the dorsum of the hands and forearms that had developed over a period of 7 to 10 days. The lesions were asymptomatic and had initially been erythematous.

Physical examination
Mottled pigmentation together with pigmented macular lesions were observed on the forearms and dorsum of the hands, particularly in the area of the anatomical snuffbox. There were similar lesions on the abdomen and thighs, with the same pattern of mottled hyperpigmentation and linear morphology, coinciding with the trouser area.

Complementary examinations
Not required.


Diagnosis
Given the distribution and characteristics of the lesions and the time of year, a question was asked about the preparation of mojitos in the weeks prior to the appearance of the lesions, and the response was affirmative. These data led to a diagnosis of lime-induced phytophotodermatitis (dorsal acropigmentation due to mojito preparation).


Treatment
Treatment consisted of informing the patient about the origin and harmlessness of the condition and adequate photoprotection.

Evolution
The evolution was satisfactory, as the lesions had improved almost completely, with post-inflammatory hypopigmentation appearing in some areas after 4 weeks.
