A 34-year-old man of Spanish nationality consulted for an increase in abdominal perimeter of about 10 days of evolution accompanied by a sensation of gastric fullness and early satiety. He reported no fever, constitutional symptoms or other symptoms of interest. He was a smoker of 15 years/pack and was a drinker of less than 20 g/day. He worked in construction. Physical examination showed good general condition, skin pallor, blood pressure 110/60, temperature 36o, heart rate 76lpm and 02 saturation 98%. No adenopathies were detected in peripheral lymph node chains. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. Abdomen: moderate ascites with no pain, no other findings of interest. Lower limbs without oedema. Complementary tests performed in the ED: red blood cells 2,900,000, Hb 8.8g/dl, HtO 25%, MCV 86.2fL, platelets 181,000miles/uL, leukocytes 3530/uL (3500 neutrophils, 400 lymphocytes, 500 monocytes). Coagulation: PT 17.6s, IQ 65.9%, INR 1.44, aPTT 27.2 Basic biochemistry normal. GOT 44, GPT 72. Chest X-ray: normal. Abdominal ultrasound was performed due to new onset ascites, confirming the presence of abundant free fluid in the perihepatic and perisplenic space, both leaks and minor pelvis. Liver with no evidence of focal lesions. Gall bladder is alliased. Porta permeable. Discrete homogeneous splenomegaly of 14.5cm. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and a clear liquid was extracted with the following findings: Red cells 140, leukocytes 210 (PMN40%, MN60%), glucose 103, protein 0.8, ADA 5, LDH 76, pH 7.4, albumin 0.6. Culture was negative and cytology showed reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. In the hospital ward the complementary tests were extended with complete blood tests: total cholesterol 89mg/dl, HDLc 23mg/dl. Total plasma protein 5.8mg/dl, albumin 3.4g/dl, Ca 7.7mg/dl, CRP 1.14mg/dl. Thyroid hormones were normal. Iron profile showed iron 25, transferrin 247, IST 8, ferritin 38. Peripheral blood smear confirmed absolute lymphopenia and anisocytosis. Platelet series normal. Folate and vitamin B12 normal. A digestive study with gastroscopy, colonoscopy and gastrointestinal transit with no findings. As it was a recently diagnosed ascites of unidentified aetiology, the serum albumin gradient and albumin in ascitic fluid were calculated, which turned out to be 2.8 (>1.1), suggestive, therefore, of Portal Hypertension (PHT). The most frequent cause of ascites in the context of portal hypertension is chronic cirrhotic liver disease of any aetiology. The study was extended to include HBV and HCV serology, anti-mitochondrial (AMA), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), anti-LKM, copper metabolism, alpha-fetoprotein, alpha 1 antitrypsin, proteinogram, immunoglobulin count and tumour markers, which were normal or negative. CA 125 of 176 (0.5-35). ANA was + to titre 1/160 nucleolar pattern with negative Anti-DNA. ECA: 86 (8-55). HIV, Rose Bengal, Q fever and Leishmania serology were negative. Mantoux was negative. Echocardiography: Normal study with no signs of right or suprahepatic pathology. A thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with contrast showed abundant ascites in all peritoneal spaces with lymphadenopathy in the mesentery and upper retroperitoneum up to 1.5cm in diameter. Discrete splenomegaly. The study was extended with MRI of the abdomen: normal liver, without pathological uptake. Thrombosis of the main portal vein with cavernomatosis, homogeneous splenomegaly. Intra-abdominal free fluid. Multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric adenopathies. In the presence of portal thrombosis of unclear cause, a hypercoagulability study was carried out, which showed no alterations of interest. To rule out paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, haemosiderinuria, haptoglobin, reticulocytes and the AMH test were normal or negative. In summary, the patient is :
- 34-year-old male with acute onset ascites and albumin gradient suggestive of portal hypertension together with homogeneous splenomegaly.
- Chronic thrombosis of the main portal vein with cavernomatosis and pathological lymphadenopathy in the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
An exploratory laparotomy with biopsy of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies was considered. Pathological anatomy showed lymph nodes with preserved architecture, presence of focal epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells without necrosis. No microorganisms were detected by PAS and Zielh techniques. Thus we have a patient with portal portal thrombosis with portal hypertension and granulomatous lymphadenitis. The clinical entities that present with peritoneal granulomatous lymphadenitis are: Granulomatous infectious diseases (TB, other mycobacteria, CF, Leprosy, Brucellosis, Typhoid fever, Whipple, etc), Lymphoproliferative tumour processes, Inflammatory bowel disease, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Chronic granulomatous disease, Immunodeficiencies, ANCA+ vasculitis (Churg-Strauss, Wegener's, microscopic polyangiitis). Due to the anatomo-pathological findings of the adenopathies (epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells without necrosis), the presence of an elevated ACE and the negativity of the rest of the study performed, the diagnosis of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with lymph node and liver involvement with portal thrombosis and portal hypertension was suggested as the first possibility. Treatment was started with steroids and oral anticoagulation with a good clinical response with gradual disappearance of the ascites and reduction in the size of the lymphadenopathies. Steroid treatment was progressively discontinued in about 9 months and anticoagulation was maintained. The patient remained clinically stable but after 4 years the ascites reappeared and signs of portal hypertension with ascites, grade II-III/IV oesophageal varices and several episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding became more evident. Anticoagulation was discontinued and beta-blockers were started as prophylaxis for rebleeding. Imaging tests showed global hepatomegaly, with lobulated contours and a very heterogeneous echostructure in relation to chronic liver disease, with abundant ascites and splenomegaly. The liver functional analysis was classified as Child Pugh B9 and MELD 10. Due to the appearance of new episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and frequent episodes of ascitic decompensation with the need for weekly paracentesis, the possibility of placing TIPS was assessed but rejected due to the technical difficulties posed by portal thrombosis. Finally, with the diagnosis of hepatic sarcoidosis with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the patient was included on the liver transplant list and an orthotopic liver transplant with temporary portacaval shunt was performed. The anatomo-pathological study of the patient's liver showed liver tissue with loss of architecture, replaced by nodules separated by fibrous septa in the centrolobulillar area with non-necrotising sarcoid granulomas. The patient is currently doing well on immunosuppressive treatment with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate as well as steroids.

Final diagnosis
Hepatic and nodal sarcoidosis with associated portal thrombosis progressing to cirrhosis with refractory portal hypertension requiring orthotopic liver transplantation.
