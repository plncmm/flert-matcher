An 8-year-old boy, with no clinical history of interest, consulted the emergency department for a clinical picture of fever up to 39.5oC for 14 days of evolution, associated with chills, pale skin, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, weakness and lack of appetite. He had been treated with azithromycin 500 mg daily for five days. Physical examination revealed the presence of a grade II/III systolic murmur in the auscultatory focus corresponding to the left ventricle. The electroencephalogram and chest X-ray showed no pathological findings. Laboratory tests showed the presence of inflammatory markers: leukocytes of 10,500 cells/ml, a neutrophilia of 70% and an elevated CRP (119 mg/L). Treatment was started with cefotaxime i.v. 200 mg/kg/day after serial blood cultures on two consecutive days. After 24 h of incubation, both blood cultures were positive. Gram stain showed pleomorphic gram-positive bacilli in a "V" shape. Direct identification of the organism from the positive blood cultures by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was C. pseudodiphtheriticum. In this context, echocardiography was performed, showing a 10 mm vegetative formation (Figure 1) on the left ventricular side, causing moderate insufficiency, without repercussions on haemodynamics and cardiac function. The presence of bicuspid aortic valve disease was also noted. With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, gentamicin (6 mg/kg/day) was added to therapy pending definitive identification of the microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile. After 24 h of incubation on solid culture media, the growth of grey colonies on blood agar plates, catalase positive, was observed. Identification by 16S RNA gene sequencing confirmed the isolation of Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum. Epsilometric antibiogram (E-test) showed resistance to azithromycin (MIC > 256 μg/ml) and sensitivity (MIC) to amoxicillin/ac. clavulanic acid (0.016 μg/ml), cefotaxime (0.38 μg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.5 μg/ml), linezolid (0.016 μg/ml), penicillin G (0.25 μg/ml) and vancomycin (0.38 μg/ml). The patient's clinical course was favourable, with remission of the febrile symptoms within 48 h of initiation of combined antimicrobial therapy. Given his good evolution, with negative blood cultures and no imaging changes, cardiac surgery was not considered at that time, unless there was any clinical deterioration. Sixteen days after hospitalisation, the patient again presented fever associated with frontal headache, disorientation and poor motor tone that evolved into right brachial paresis, right hemicara and aphasia. The picture was interpreted as a cerebral septic embolism. Linezolid was added to the antimicrobial treatment for possible superinfection by resistant microorganisms in another focus. Given the risk of a new embolism, cardiac surgery was performed on the aortic valve territory (Ross procedure), which was successfully completed. On the third post-operative day, the patient developed intracranial hypertension. A brain MRI was performed which revealed an ischaemic infarction due to occlusion at the origin of the left middle cerebral artery. Due to its severity, the patient died in the following days. The final microbiological results again confirmed the isolation of C. pseudodiphtheriticum in blood cultures.
