Anamnesis
Male patient aged 63 years, ex-smoker for 14 years of 60 packs/year, hypertensive on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide/telmisartan once a day.

Oncological history: operated on in August 2012 for left renal neoplasia, radical nephrectomy was performed, with no surgical complications. The pathological anatomy (AP) reported a well-demarcated nodular lesion of 2.7 cm in greatest diameter; the immunohistochemical (IHC) study showed strong positive expression for CK7 and CK Cam 5.2, all compatible with multifocal clear cell papillary carcinoma with extensive areas of necrosis, Fuhrman grade 2. As it was an indolent tumour, it was decided to follow six-monthly check-ups by the Urology Department, with no evidence of recurrence until December 2013 (abdominal CT scan).

The current disease began in March 2014, when the patient attended the emergency department for cough with limited haemoptotic expectoration of one week's duration and constitutional syndrome of one month.

Physical examination
Good general condition, mucocutaneous pallor, eupneic at rest, haemodynamically stable. Pulmonary auscultation was preserved, without added noises; in the abdomen there was a left lumbotomy scar, limbs without oedema. The rest was normal.

Complementary tests
The patient was admitted to the Pneumology Department to complete the study:
"CBC: haemoglobin 7.7 g/dl, leukocytes 6,300 (lymphocytes 1,000), rest normal.
"Chest CT scan: solid mass with lobulated contours measuring 70 x 70 mm in the posterior mediastinum, centred in the subcarinal region, entering the right bronchus; it is also stenotic and obliterates the bronchus intermedius. Right hilar adenomegaly up to 14 mm.
"PET-CT scan: bilobulated and irregular hypermetabolic mass of 7 cm at subcarinal and right hilar level compatible with neoplastic mass, without being able to discern whether it is an adenopathic conglomerate or a primary bronchial lesion.
"Two bronchofibroscopies were performed: the cytology was indicative of carcinoma, but the biopsies were not diagnostic.
"The case was presented at the meeting of the Multidisciplinary Thoracic Tumour Management Committee and it was decided to perform diagnostic mediastinoscopy, given the dilemma of the mass being a second primary tumour or metachronous metastasis of the previous one. Mediastinoscopy was performed with biopsy of subcarinal adenopathy. The PA reports: metastasis of carcinoma, IHC with positivity for vimentin, CD 10 and PAX 8 suggesting renal origin.

Diagnosis
Mediastinal metastasis of primary renal carcinoma.

Treatment
In June 2013 she started chemotherapy as part of a clinical trial, receiving pazopanib 800 mg/day, with monthly evaluations.

Evolution
In August 2013 he was hospitalised for a non-condensing respiratory infection, with positive sputum cultures for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, receiving specific antibiotic treatment according to antibiogram (sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), with joint follow-up with the Infectious Pathology Unit.
During admission, a CT scan was performed (according to clinical trial protocol) which showed a decrease in the size of the infracarinal mediastinal mass, with the presence of bubbles inside it and an increase in the size of the left common iliac and external iliac adenopathy.
Given the persistence of respiratory symptoms and the fact that the patient reported choking every time he ingested food, with a subsequent coughing crisis, a chest X-ray was performed, showing right basal condensation (not previously visualised). Suspecting an oesophageal fistula, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was requested, which revealed a 5 cm long ulcerated extrinsic compression in the middle third of the oesophagus, for which an oesophageal prosthesis was placed at the same time. After progressive improvement of symptoms, he was discharged.
Pazopanib was restarted and received for a further 2 months; however, despite the good radiological response, the patient's general condition progressively deteriorated (ECOG 4), and for this reason it was decided to discontinue treatment at the end of November 2014.
Finally, the patient died in December 2014, 7 months after the diagnosis of recurrence.
