A 20-year-old mixed race woman from the Peruvian jungle of Iquitos, Loreto, was admitted with fever and lymphadenopathy of one and a half months' duration. He reported no pathological history of interest, denied having received blood transfusions and had had protected sexual relations with only one partner. She also presented a progressive increase in parotid volume, associated with facial oedema. One week before admission to hospital, the patient reported progressive dysphagia to solids. On physical examination, her temperature was 39.5Â°C, she had lymphadenopathy in the submandibular, axillary, cervical and left palpebral areas and hepatomegaly.

A complete blood count was performed: haemoglobin 10.7 g/dl, leucocyte count 9,690 cells/mm3 and platelets 179,000 cells/mm3. Coagulation, liver and renal function tests were normal. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was high: 1,020 mg/dl. Serology for HTLV-1 was positive and negative for HIV. A chest X-ray revealed a tumour mass located in the middle lobe of the right lung. A biopsy of one of the axillary lymph nodes was performed and histology showed a diffuse proliferation of lymphoid cells with scant cytoplasm and a high mitotic index, without flowering cells. The findings were suggestive of a lymphoproliferative process, consistent with a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lymphoblastic type. Bronchoscopy was performed to study the thoracic tumour mass, histopathological analysis of which revealed small cells associated with the lymphoproliferative process. Immunohistochemistry of the lymph node tissue and lung tumour was positive for specific markers, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+. In sum, the diagnosis of lymphomatous LLTA was made by clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical findings. Proviral integration into host DNA was demonstrated by PCR (proviral load was 666). In addition, immunohistochemical study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed because the patient presented with neurological deterioration manifested by seizure episodes. CSF showed infiltration of neoplastic cells with expression of specific markers such as CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, CD25+, CD45+. The patient received chemotherapy with EPOCH (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, doxorubicin and vincristine) associated with intrathecal prophylaxis based on her neurological involvement. Post-chemotherapy she presented an episode of febrile neutropenia which was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The patient died a few days later as a result of septic shock and neurological complications.
