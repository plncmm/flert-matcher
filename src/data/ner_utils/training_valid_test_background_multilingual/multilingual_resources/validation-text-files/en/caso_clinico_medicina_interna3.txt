Patient aged 34, pharmacist, who was implanted with a pacemaker at the age of 16 after being evaluated for syncope and possible episodes of AV block detected on Holter. In March 2009, when she was 31 years old, the generator was removed due to inactivity. Subsequently, he developed progressive asthenia, had 8 febrile episodes lasting 24-48 hours, sometimes up to 40o, without focus. Hepatosplenomegaly was detected and she was referred to our clinic. Examination: soft hepatosplenomegaly at 3 crossings, no signs of chronic liver disease, no lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary normal.

Complementary studies: leukocytes 5,000; platelets 115,000; Hb 12.7; haematocrit 37.5%; ESR 41; bilirubin 1.7 (D 0.69); GOT 34; GPT 20; GGT 98; LDH 334. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Serial blood cultures, negative serology for Brucella, lupus, HIV and CMV. Coxiella stage I: 1/64; stage II: 1/256. Normal ECG. Echocardiogram: image in the inferior cava suggestive of stenosis/thrombosis in the inferior cava; thickening of the cables with a deflected, mobile scalloped image; serology was assessed and he was treated with Doxycycline and Ciprofloxacin (3 months) and TTE was performed: deflected image in the ventricular electrode at the level of the tricuspid valve, mobile, measuring 7x11 mm.


Evolution: fever disappears, general condition improves, hepatosplenomegaly disappears and phase reactants normalise. Evolutionary serology for Coxiella: phase I not detected; phase II: 1/128. December-10: new syncopal symptoms. Cardiac Holter normal. Fever reappears for a week, without focus, which subsides with Doxycycline and Ciprofloxacin. In January 11: she developed abdominal distension and umbilical hernia and underwent surgery for which ascitic fluid leaked from the wound for several weeks, a total of 7 litres. Ascitic fluid examination: transudate. Spontaneous remission. In March-11: greater amount of ascites. Examination: no signs of chronic liver disease. Normal gynaecological examination. Laboratory tests: leucotrombopenia, prothrombin activity 67%. Serology B, C virus, iron metabolism, copper, ceruloplasmin, antimitochondrial antibodies, ANA and LKM antibodies: negative. In May-11: new febrile episode with shivering, with negative serology and haemocultures. Ascites did not reappear but oedema appeared and splenomegaly increased. Abdominal ultrasound: homogeneous hepatosplenomegaly. Gastroscopy: incipient oesophageal varices. Reactive bone marrow with negative cultures. Liver biopsy: cholestasis; Knodell index 4; portal fibrosis grade 2/6. TTE similar to previous ones. Abdominal CT: suspicion of infection of pacemaker wires is maintained and the diagnosis of abdominal vascular obstruction is added. Finally, a procedure is performed that leads to a definitive diagnosis and resolution of the problem.
