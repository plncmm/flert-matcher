A 60-year-old man with a history of aortic prosthesis and double coronary bypass, with antephrenic pericardiectomy complicated by bacteraemia due to S. epidirmitis. He presented with diarrhoea of 24 hours' duration. Examination revealed fever and hypotension. Laboratory tests showed a CRP of 12.07 mg/dl and metabolic acidosis.

Abdominal X-ray showed distension of the colon and oedema of the colon wall. In view of the torpid evolution and tendency to hypotension, the ICU department requested an abdominal CT scan with VSD, showing generalised dilatation of the colic framework, with nodular submucosal mural thickening and oedema of the folds (accordion sign). It is associated with free intraperitoneal fluid and scant involvement of the pericolic fat. The findings are compatible with pancolitis. Given the history of recent surgery and broad-spectrum antibiotherapy, pseudomembranous pancolitis due to Clostridium difficile is suggested. Toxins A and B were positive in stool at 24h.
