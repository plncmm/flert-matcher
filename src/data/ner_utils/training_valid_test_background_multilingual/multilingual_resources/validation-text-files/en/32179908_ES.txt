An otherwise healthy, 55-day-old, mixed breastfeeding baby girl became ill with rhinorrhoea and dry cough on 28 January 2020. She was admitted to our hospital on 2 February 2020. Prior to the onset of symptoms, between 16 and 24 January, her parents had taken her to Lu "an (Hubei province) for a family party. At the party, the girl's uncle and aunt, who live in Wuhan, developed a cough and fever. Then, on 31 January 2020, the girl's parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of their symptoms, chest X-rays and nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swabs. The nasopharyngeal swab obtained from the girl also tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time RT-PCR.
On admission, physical examination showed normal vital signs except for pharyngeal hyperaemia. A chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. Laboratory tests showed alterations in liver functional capacity values and a mildly abnormal myocardial cytogram. Lymphocyte count, thrombocyte count, CD8+ T-lymphocyte count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M value were slightly high. Other laboratory tests of the patient showed no abnormalities, such as haemoglobin, D-dimer, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and renal functional capacity. Tests for rotavirus in stool and cytomegalovirus in blood were negative. Based on the clear contact history and the above results, the girl was diagnosed with COVID-19 (normal type). She was isolated and treated empirically with interferon α-1b (15μg, twice daily) by inhalation, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (30 mg/kg, every 8 hours, i.v. glucose tolerance test), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid and the traditional Chinese drug lotus qingwen. On hospital days 2-6 (days 7-11 of illness), the patient worsened, presenting with frequent productive cough and occasional tachycardia (150-170 l.p.m.). On the morning of the fourth day of hospitalisation, a decrease in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (lowest PaO2: 56 mmHg) with high lactic acid values when breathing room air was observed. Sputum aspiration was applied. In the meantime, oxygen was immediately administered via nasal cannula and ambroxol was given to clear the phlegm. As a worsening trend was observed, a second chest CT scan was performed on the evening of the fourth day of hospitalisation (day 9 of illness), which showed evidence of progression of pneumonia. The radiological findings were consistent with a worsening respiratory status. The abnormal myocardial cytogram on admission and an increase in troponin I (0.025 μg per litre) on the fourth day of hospitalisation indicated myocardial injury, so she was given i.v. sodium phosphocreatine to protect the heart. During this period, the child continued to have a good appetite and did not present with diarrhoea, oliguria or shock. On day 11 of illness, a stool sample was collected for the first time to detect viral RNA; the PCR result was positive.
On hospital days 7 to 12 (sick days 12 to 17), the patient's clinical condition gradually improved and respiratory symptoms disappeared on sick day 11. Oxygen therapy was withdrawn and her oxygen saturation values were 94% to 100% on room air. Pulse rate was maintained between 120 and 140 bpm. Laboratory tests on hospital day 10 showed that myocardial cytometry and hepatic functional capacity had returned to normal values. On hospital day 11 (sick day 16), a third chest CT scan clearly showed that the patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities had been absorbed. Based on the patient's clinical picture and other analytical tests, Citrobacter freundii found in two sputum cultures was considered a respiratory tract colonising bacterium and was not treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained on hospital days 10 to 13 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-PCR tests. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium was withdrawn on hospital day 11 and interferon α-1b was withdrawn the following day. According to the latest interim guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China, the patient met the criteria for discharge. However, we found that anal swabs collected on hospital days 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, the patient remained hospitalised. As of 16 February 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for further isolation and observation. In the process of reviewing the manuscript, we have learned that she remained asymptomatic during this period and that the anal swab collected on 28 February 2020 was negative for this viral RNA. For the patient's mother, we learned that viral RNA was detected in stool samples from the mother on 4 February 2020 (day 8 of illness) and in an anal swab on 7 February 2020 (day 11 of illness), although she had no abdominal symptoms. In addition, three consecutive tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk were negative between 2 and 4 February 2020. The mother's urine samples, collected on 6 February 2020, also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
