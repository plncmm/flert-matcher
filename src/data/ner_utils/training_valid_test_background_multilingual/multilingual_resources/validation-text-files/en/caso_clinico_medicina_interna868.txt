A 59-year-old man with no personal or family history of interest, except for macrocytic anaemia treated with oral iron and a history of glossitis recorded by his primary care doctor. He works as a treasurer in a nut factory. He was admitted to Internal Medicine with a condition characterised by asthenia, apathy, weight loss of 20 kg in one year and subacute neurological symptoms consisting of disorientation, bradypsychia, somnolence and paraesthesia in all four extremities. On arrival at the ward, haemodynamically stable, adequate heart rate and afebrile. Moderate cachexia. Conscious and oriented, bradypsychic. Mucocutaneous pallor. No alterations in the ENT area. Cardiorespiratory auscultation and abdominal examination without relevant findings. No de novo skin lesions. Neurological examination with no motor deficits or gross sensory alterations, normal cranial nerves. No cerebellar alterations. Osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical.
With regard to the complementary tests, the urgent analysis showed a slight elevation of bilirubin at the expense of direct bilirubin (total 1.37 mg/dl, direct 0.86 mg/dl) and haemoglobin 75 g/l with macrocytic macrochromic characteristics. A skull CT scan showed no LOEs, haemorrhagic or ischaemic foci. A lumbar puncture was performed and showed no pathological findings. Laboratory tests revealed a severe vitamin B12 deficiency (12, 50 pg/ml) with normal thyroid hormones. Intermediate fever serology was negative (including syphilis, HIV hepatitis). In addition, negative HSV, EBV, B. burdgoferi. Blood cultures negative (x2). Basic autoimmunity was also negative.
A CT scan of the thorax-abdomen-pelvis showed prostatic hyperplasia and a 10 mm circumferential thickening in the middle rectum, so a colonoscopy was requested, which revealed no pathological findings. The electroneurogram revealed a predominantly sensory and axonal polyneuropathy.
Based on the above, a diagnosis of megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency was made.
The aetiology of this deficit was sought, and so anti-parietal antibodies, anti-intrinsic factor antibodies and a celiac disease study (antibodies and HLA) were requested, which was negative. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, revealing chronic atrophic gastritis with metaplasia, duodenum without alterations. H. Pylori negative.
Finally, the diagnosis of megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to chronic atrophic gastritis with metaplasia was established.
