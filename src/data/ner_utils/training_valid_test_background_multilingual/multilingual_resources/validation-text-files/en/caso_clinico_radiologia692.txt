59-year-old patient with febrile and emetic syndrome of one week's evolution, right hypochondrium pain, Murphy negative. Leukocytosis, 21,000, and CRP, 300. With clinical suspicion of febrile syndrome with abdominal focus, CT scan was requested.

The abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of a focal hypodense hepatic lesion (attenuation 15-20 HU), located in the right hepatic lobe, with lobulated contours and septa, with marginal and septal enhancement. This lesion caused obliteration of the middle hepatic vein and stenosis of the right superior portal branch. Discrete amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The rest of the abdominal structures showed no significant alterations. A differential diagnosis of pyogenic/amebic abscess, primary tumour (hepatocellular carcinoma, cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma), metastasis, among others, was proposed, and abscess was established as the first possibility due to semiology and clinical suspicion.
