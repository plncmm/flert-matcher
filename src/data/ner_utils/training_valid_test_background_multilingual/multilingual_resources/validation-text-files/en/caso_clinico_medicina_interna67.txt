This is a 64-year-old male with a personal history of arterial hypertension, anaphylaxis due to wasp sting with sensitisation to polistes wasp in 2010, meningeal TB and spondylodiscitis in his youth (not documented in the clinical history), SAHS, benign prostatic hypertrophy, anxiety disorder. Smoker for 40 years, 1 pack/day, not a regular drinker. Operated on right paramaxillary adenoma. Lives with his wife. Last trip to Costa Rica in July 2013 for 10 days, no risky contacts, no unprocessed food. No drug allergies. Current treatment with soluble Allergovac (polistes), Alprazolam 0.5mg at night, Tamsulosin 0.4mg/day. Consultation in August 2013 in the emergency department of our hospital due to a thermometric fever of 38°C of 4 days' evolution and asthenia. Physical examination was unremarkable, blood tests were normal except for normochromic normocytic anaemia and CRP 92 mg/dl. Chest X-ray was normal. Blood cultures x 2 were requested, subsequently reported as negative, and he was discharged with antipyretics and monitored by his general practitioner. One week later, he was referred to the internal medicine department for elevated acute phase reactants, continued with fever and the appearance of joint pain and erythematous, non-elevated, non-pruritic skin lesions on the anterior and posterior trunk that did not disappear with acupressure. Referring similar symptoms to previous doses of Allergovac but of lesser intensity, a first diagnostic impression is made of: Serum sickness and spondyloarthrosis. A new battery of tests with autoimmunity is ordered. One month later, he was assessed again in our department, at that time in his 5th dose of Allergovac, he defined more reaction in the left arm with oedema and pruritus, exanthema in torso and back, currently without fever, but he persisted episodes of migratory arthritis in both hands and oedema in the left ankle. Blood tests, biochemistry, haemostasis, lipidogram, iron metabolism, ANAs, complement, immunoglobulins, serology (HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, Brucella, Toxoplasma), urine auramine/rhodamine stain normal. Blood in stool: first sample positive. Tumour markers normal except beta-2 microglobulin 5.19 mg/l. Examination revealed only slight left bimalleolar oedema, hepatomegaly of two finger widths and moderate pain in the left iliac fossa. Treatment was started with corticosteroids in a descending pattern due to clinical suspicion of migratory polymyalgia and an appointment was made with a preferential abdominal ultrasound scan. The abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged fatty liver, without obvious LOES, splenomegaly, spleen 135 mm long. The radiologist, on visualising a pulmonary window that was not initially contemplated, found thrombus in the right lower lobar pulmonary artery and in at least four right basal segmental arteries, also thrombus in a left basal segmental and subsegmental artery and slight hepatosplenomegaly. It was decided to admit the patient to our ward. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed: mild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, PSAP of 32 mmHg. Good global and segmental function. Intermittent fever was observed during admission with negative blood cultures, a lumbar puncture was performed, which was impossible to perform due to hyperalgesia in the puncture area, so an MRI of the lumbar spine was requested, which revealed a more significant spondylodiskarthrosis at L5-S1. There was still normocytic anaemia, so a gastroscopy was performed with the following finding: chronic gastritis and H. pilory and colonoscopy with no findings. The option of performing a bone marrow aspirate was discussed with the Haematology Department, considering that it was not currently indicated given the absence of clinical, analytical and imaging data suggesting a haematological process, although in the event of persistent febrile symptoms, a microbiological bone marrow culture would be reconsidered. On the third day of admission, the patient experienced no fever despite the reduction of the corticosteroid regimen administered on an outpatient basis. He was discharged with oral anticoagulation (Sintrom), treatment to eradicate H. pilory and subsequent follow-up in the consulting room. He was seen in consultation and referred to the Rheumatology Service for persistent generalised pain before minimal friction and pain with joint inflammation in the hands and knees, as well as fever causing general malaise (maximum of 37.3°C) which improved with Paracetamol. At that time he was on 15mg of corticoids and felt worse, with the joint inflammation appearing, as well as pain in the cartilage of the right ear and nose. On examination: arthritis of the hands (MCF and IFP plus the left) with limited mobility and pain. There were also erythematous skin lesions on the torso and arms. Blood tests: ESR: 49; Hb: 11.2; Ht: 34.7; MCV: 99.7; Reticulocytes: 1.66; CRP: 31 mg/dl. He was discharged with Metrotexate 2.5 mg weekly (2 tablets Thursday and 2 tablets for dinner), Acfol 5 mg weekly and increased to 20 mg of Dacortin with a suspected diagnosis of polyarthritis/undifferentiated connective tissue disease and an appointment was made for a biopsy by the Dermatology Service, who reported it to be compatible with urticaria. He was seen in December 2013, he continued with generalised pain, and reported fever and general malaise the day after taking methotrexate, which is why he discontinued it. ESR: 28 and CRP: 28.8 mg/dl. Examination was unremarkable and there were no lesions at the time of assessment. Treatment was started with Leflunomide 20 mg/day as he could not tolerate Metrotexate, and Fosavance 5600 1 cp weekly was added. The patient decided to go on his own to the Clínica Universidad de Navarra, where he underwent a bone marrow aspirate and skin biopsy compatible with leukaemia cutis in the context of myelodysplastic syndrome with 10% blasts in the bone marrow. He was seen again in the Soria Internal Medicine Department and was referred to the Haematology Department. Due to the patient's age and general condition, he was considered a candidate for intensive chemotherapy. A new biopsy of the lesion was performed due to doubts in the previous histological diagnosis. Finally the patient was diagnosed with: Myelodysplastic syndrome type AREB-1 with paraneoplastic Sweet's syndrome. He is currently being treated with Azacitidine and a descending course of corticoids, with a good clinical and analytical response.
