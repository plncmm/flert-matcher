Anamnesis
A 54-year-old woman, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic, with recurrent depressive disorder (two attempts at self-harm), attended the emergency department for clinical manifestations of 2-3 weeks of evolution consisting of asthenia, weakness, progressive motor clumsiness, somnolence and difficulty in performing basic activities. She denies other clinical manifestations of interest. No intake of non-prescribed medication or increase in dosage. Examination revealed emotional lability, some bradypsychia and clumsiness in fine movements, associated with uraemic fetor. On arrival, he presented with acute renal failure with creatinine of 10.31 mg/dl and urea of 256 mg/dl (last control 8 months earlier with creatinine 1.1mg/dl), metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L and ions and renal ultrasound without alterations.

Evolution on the ward
After admission to the nephrology department, the patient reported chronic consumption over the last 10 years of Cassia Angustifoli infusions purchased at a herbalist's to combat chronic constipation, taking up to 8-10 infusions daily. A complete study was carried out, including blood and urine proteinogram, immunoglobulins, autoimmunity, complement and tumour markers, all of which were normal. After hydration, intensive serum therapy and alkaline diuresis, renal function recovered rapidly within 72h, with creatinine of 1 mg/dl at discharge, and she remained asymptomatic.

Diagnosis
Severe acute renal failure (ClCr: 6.40 ml/min) with metabolic acidosis associated with excessive consumption of natural laxative (Cassia Angustifoli).
