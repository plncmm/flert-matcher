A 31-year-old woman with 2-3 days of general malaise with non-productive cough and bilious vomiting accompanied by fever and dysuria, diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia. Predictive scales for pneumonia were calculated: FINE 1 (30-day mortality < 1%). CURB-65 (mortality 0.7%). Given the prostration, hypoxaemia and radiographic image, admission to internal medicine was decided, despite the low scores on the scales.
Twenty-four hours after admission, clinical, blood gas and radiographic deterioration led to admission to the ICU for septic shock, meeting the criteria for severe pneumonia according to ATS/IDSA 2007. After 44 days in hospital, she was discharged with diagnoses of CAP, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, vocal cord paralysis in abduction, hyponatraemia, systemic candidiasis due to Candida parapsilosis, fibrosis and pulmonary infiltrates, paralytic ileus. He is currently being followed up in internal medicine and rehabilitation outpatient clinics for post-pneumonia bedridden syndrome. He is in a wheelchair, although he walks with a walker at home. He also attends speech therapy consultations for voice recovery. Results: Once the diagnosis of CAP has been established, a prognostic assessment must be made to decide whether the patient should be hospitalised or not, and where. Clinical judgement alone is imprecise and insufficient and depends on the experience of the doctor in charge, and may underestimate or overestimate the severity of the process, so "prognostic and severity scales" are used, which estimate the probability of death in patients with CAP, identifying patients at low risk of death, who can be treated on an outpatient basis, and recognising patients at high risk who should be admitted. Our patient with a calculated Fine of I and a low CRUB-65 would be a candidate for outpatient treatment. She did not present any seriousness data in the first assessment but the patient's prostration, the radiographic image and the low oxygen saturation led to the decision to admit her to hospital. The evolution of CAP was disastrous, with admission to the ICU unit and all possible subsequent complications.
