Anamnesis
A 15-year-old patient came to our clinic for assessment of two lesions, located on both upper limbs, of one month's evolution. The patient had already been assessed for these same lesions, with the diagnosis of lesions caused by arthropod bites with superinfection, for which he was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and topical corticosteroid, with partial resolution of the symptoms. The patient reports fluctuations in the severity of the lesions, with subjective perception of improvement after infliximab infusions. He denies general malaise, fever or other systemic symptoms. No foreign travel, no contact with animals, denies handling of animals. He lives in a town in the south of the Community of Madrid. As personal history, the patient has been diagnosed with non-bacterial osteitis with mainly pelvic involvement for four years, with the development of psoriasis two years ago. He is being treated with infliximab every six weeks and leflunomide 20 mg daily.

Physical examination
Examination revealed two ulcerated lesions: on the right forearm, ulcer with a clean background, erythematous-violaceous borders and a perilesional erythematous halo. Infiltrated on palpation and measuring 17 x 14 mm in diameter. In the left humeral area there was a smaller lesion, measuring 12 x 10 mm, with similar characteristics to the first lesion, covered by a serohaemorrhagic crust. There were no other lesions on skin examination.

Complementary examinations
Two biopsies of the larger lesion were necessary to reach a conclusive diagnosis. Histopathological and microbiological analysis was performed on both biopsies. Laboratory tests were performed with different determinations, including serology and blood parasite culture.

Diagnosis
The pathological anatomy of the first biopsy showed multiple non-necrotising granulomatous formations consisting of epithelioid cells with lymphocytic crown and multinuclear giant cells. No microorganisms were identified by PAS, Grocott and Ziehl's techniques.
The second biopsy showed a dense polymorphous lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with abundant histiocytic aggregates with a granulomatous appearance. The infiltrate was also accompanied by abundant cellular detritus.
PCR of the biopsied tissue was positive for Leishmania infantum. Serology was positive for parasites of the genus Leishmania. PCR detection of Leishmania antigens in blood and urine was negative.
The diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis was therefore established.

Treatment
The patient started treatment with intralesional meglumine antimoniate 1500 mg/5 ml, divided between the two lesions. The patient received seven doses spread over three weeks. Prior to and during treatment, successive analyses were performed with hepatic, renal and ion profiles, with no relevant alterations in these parameters. The electrocardiogram was monitored and showed no alterations during treatment. The patient had a feeling of dysthermia during the hours following the injections, which was treated with paracetamol 600 mg.

Evolution
After receiving seven doses, the patient presented complete resolution of the skin symptoms and persistent negativity in the detection of Leishmania antigens in blood by PCR.
