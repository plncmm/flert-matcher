A 57-year-old man with cough, dyspnoea, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fever up to 38.7 °C and abdominal pain, of 8 days' evolution. The trunk and thighs showed symmetrical and extensive livedo reticularis. Laboratory tests showed high values of C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer, as well as lymphocytopenia. A nasopharyngeal smear PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 and a chest CT scan showed multifocal ground-glass opacities, indicative of COVID-19. Because of the unusual sudden onset of symmetrical livedo reticularis in a middle-aged man, additional testing for pre-existing diseases was performed. Although anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, thrombocytes, INR/APTT rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins and anti-phospholipid antibodies were negative, antinuclear factor was positive, with nuclear pattern (value 1/320, but without specificity for ENA transfer). The previous value of anti-nuclear factor was unknown, and to date it has not been investigated whether COVID-19 can induce this type of antibody. Infectious causes of livedo, such as HIV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, syphilis, Legionella pneumophila, influenza A/B, RSV, hepatitis B/C were negative. For 8 days, oxygen, acetaminophen, hydroxychloroquine and low molecular weight heparin were administered in a preventive regimen. After discharge, the livedo fluctuated but progressively disappeared. At three weeks, inflammatory parameters were normal (except for a very slightly elevated ferritin value), although the patient still suffered from mild exertional dyspnoea.
