We present the case of a 4-year-old female patient, with no personal history of interest, who consulted the Emergency Department for a fever of 72 hours (up to 39.5°C) and intermittent diffuse abdominal pain with no other symptoms. Family history: father with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) undergoing chemotherapy. Vital signs and physical examination on arrival: temperature 37°C, heart rate (HR) 155 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 37 rpm, blood pressure (BP) 90/40 mmHg, saturation 89% with inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 21%. General malaise, skin pallor, acral coldness and elongated capillary refill. Petechial rash on the neck, back and lower limbs. Subcostal tugging and hypoventilation and crackles in the left hemithorax. Rhythmic tones without murmurs. Pharyngeal hyperemia. Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or megaliths. Lethargic and bradypsychic, with no evidence of neurological focality or nuchal rigidity.

The patient presented a febrile syndrome of 72 hours' evolution, accompanied by tachycardia and tachypnoea at the time of assessment, and therefore met the diagnostic criteria for sepsis. In view of this clinical suspicion, oxygen therapy was started with a mask with reservoir, maintaining haemoglobin saturations of around 93%, two peripheral lines were cannulated, volume loading was prescribed in the form of physiological saline solution (20 ml/kg) and antibiotherapy was started with EV ceftriaxone, after drawing blood tests, venous blood gases and cultures. Admission to the PICU was decided. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytes 2,970/mm3, lymphocytes 240/mm3, haemoglobin (Hb) 10.6 g/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 92.6 mg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) 34 ng/ml. Venous blood gases: pH 7.26, pCO2 53 mmHg, HCO3 21.8 mmol/L, base excess (BE) -5 mEq/L, lactic 4.8 mmol/L. Ionogram, renal, hepatic and coagulation functions were normal. After admission to the PICU, clinical worsening persisted, fulfilling the criteria for established septic shock, with maintained arterial hypotension despite expansion of blood volume (total fluids 80 ml/kg). Orotracheal intubation with connection to invasive mechanical ventilation was performed, central venous access was channelled and inotropic support with dopamine and dobutamine was started. A chest X-ray was performed, showing consolidation in the left lung field and right upper lobe, and an echocardiogram showed correct biventricular function, with no evidence of structural heart disease. A few hours after admission, the Microbiology Service reported the growth of gram-positive cocci with Streptococcus morphology in the blood culture, as well as a positive pharyngeal smear for Streptococcus pyogenes. Physical examination revealed a progression of the exanthema on the thorax, which acquired scarlatiniform features. In the first hours of admission, haemodynamic lability was observed with a significant systolic-diastolic blood pressure differential that required inotropic support with noradrenaline and increased oxygen requirements (FiO2 of 0.4 to 0.6) to maintain haemoglobin saturations within the normal range. Hours after achieving clinical stability and control of the sepsis, the appearance of right crepitus, hepatomegaly and central venous pressures (CVP) > 12 cm H2O was noted. A new radiological control was requested.

A pulmonary ultrasound was performed showing lung oedema (increased B lines), in addition to left pleural effusion (30 mm) and the presence of ipsilateral consolidation. Water restriction was performed and diuresis was forced with furosemide, achieving a negative water balance and PVC values between 5-10 cm H2O. Despite this, 36 hours after admission, high FiO2 requirements persisted with PEEP between 8-10 cmH2O, so it was decided to perform thoracentesis and place a pleural drainage tube, obtaining 415 ml of serohaematic fluid, with no evidence of empyema.

Following the implementation of these measures, respiratory and haemodynamic improvement was initially observed. However, on the fourth day of admission, there was a progressive worsening in respiratory function with difficulty in oxygenation, with an oxygenation index (OI) of 25, despite optimisation of parameters (FIO2 up to 0.9 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) up to 11 cmH2O) with bilateral hypoventilation and cardiac auscultation without alterations. Haemodynamics maintained with noradrenaline and adrenaline at low doses. Control laboratory tests: leukocytes 6,200/mm3, Hb 11.8 g/dl, haematocrit 36%, platelets 97,000/mm3. Elevated CRP and PCT. Worsening of bilateral pulmonary parenchyma in radiological control.

In view of the patient's hypoxaemia, an echocardiographic check-up was performed with no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or signs of PTE, and Hb and haematocrit figures were stable. In addition, a new lung ultrasound examination was performed, which showed the appearance of a bilateral patchy pattern. In view of the diagnosis of ARDS, the ventilatory strategy was modified by applying an open lung ventilation strategy with high PEEP (up to 15 cmH20), low tidal volume, permissive hypercapnia and it was decided to place the patient in the prone position, as well as to perform recruitment manoeuvres.

Following the appearance of scarlatiniform rash, which subsequently affected the oral and genital mucosa, the possibility of streptococcal TSS was raised. The appearance of complications associated with the entity was carefully monitored. Finally, on the fourth day of admission, after the onset of ARDS and the appearance of thrombopenia, she met the diagnostic criteria for streptococcal TSS.

Streptococcus pyogenes is highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics; however, the use of penicillin monotherapy in cases of TSS is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Clindamycin was added to previous treatment with EV ceftriaxone. Immunoglobulin G levels (200 mg/dl; normal range 700-1,700 mg/dl) were requested and after low levels were found, treatment with EV immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was started.

Given the immunosuppressed state of the patient's father (ALL), oral penicillin prophylaxis was indicated (250 mg/6 hours for two days). The patient's clinical and laboratory evolution was favourable. Antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and clindamycin was maintained for 14 days, with negative control cultures. From the respiratory point of view, elective extubation to non-invasive ventilation was achieved after 15 days of invasive mechanical ventilation, with subsequent support with high-flow oxygen therapy and its definitive withdrawal 19 days after admission. An immunity study was performed with normal results. She is currently asymptomatic and has not presented any new infectious processes requiring hospital admission.
