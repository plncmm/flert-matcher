A 53-year-old male transsexual consulted for self-palpation of a left breast mass.
The patient started cross-hormonal treatment with intramuscular testosterone at increasing doses at 36 years of age. Two years later, bilateral mastectomy with nipple reimplantation was performed, followed by hysterectomy with double adnexectomy and sex reassignment surgery, and she had no previous history of interest except for a maternal aunt with breast cancer.
On physical examination, a firm, non-painful mass of less than 2 cm was palpable. In view of the suspicion of malignancy, breast ultrasound and mammography were performed, describing an 18 mm spiculated nodule with polymorphous calcifications in the upper quadrant of the left breast, and core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of suspicion.

Breast ultrasound: Spiculated nodule with polymorphous calcifications in UCS of MI; 18 mm in diameter.

Mammography: Bilateral fibroglandular tissue. Post-treatment changes in both breasts. Spiculated nodule with polymorphous calcifications in UCS of MI; 18 mm in diameter.

To complete the study, a chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were performed, which were compatible with normality. The histopathological examination of the sample showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade 2 (pT1c N0/2 M0) and immunohistochemical staining showed estrogen receptor (ER) expression 100%, progesterone receptor (PR) 40%, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression negative, androgen receptor expression 60-70%, and Ki-67 index of 50%. To rule out distant metastasis, bone scintigraphy was performed and no pathological findings were found.

After presenting the case to the oncology committee, it was decided to complete treatment with chemotherapy and adjuvant hormone therapy and the patient was advised to discontinue testosterone treatment.

The patient is currently being treated with tamoxifen after 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel. During treatment the patient decided not to stop testosterone treatment for fear of the disappearance of secondary male characteristics, despite the presence of androgen receptors in the tumour.
