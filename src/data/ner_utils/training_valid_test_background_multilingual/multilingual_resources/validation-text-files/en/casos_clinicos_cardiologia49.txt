HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
We present the case of a 72-year-old patient, operated on for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with implantation of a biological aortic prosthesis (Mitroflow no21), who was admitted for febrile syndrome. The patient had a personal history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and was being treated with enalapril 10mg, one tablet every 12 hours, and simvastatin 40 mg, one tablet per day. Three months after the operation, the patient consulted the emergency department for two weeks of fever (> 38°C), asthenia, anorexia and deterioration of general condition. On physical examination he was haemodynamically stable (BP 140/80 mmHg; HR 75 bpm, SatO2 97 % breathing room air). Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic, tachycardic sounds, with systolic murmur II/VI in the aortic focus, with no clinical signs of heart failure. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, with no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
The admission blood test showed a high white blood cell count (16,000/μL) at the expense of neutrophils (87%) with elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 267 mg/l), the rest of the analytical parameters being normal. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and signs of left chamber enlargement with an overload pattern. On admission, 4 batches of serial blood cultures were taken and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in all the bottles, so antibiotic therapy was started with vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin, in accordance with the regimen recommended by clinical practice guidelines. As a first approach, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed, which showed a biological prosthesis in the aortic position, with adequate opening of its leaflets, without the presence of periprosthetic regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or conclusive signs of endocarditis. Given the high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis, it was decided to extend the study with positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET/CT), which showed increased FDG uptake at the level of the aortic root, periprosthetic, of annular morphology and with a SUVmax (Standard Uptake Value) of 5, compatible with endocarditis. It was decided to perform a new TEE, 2 weeks after the first study, where signs of endocarditis with significant periprosthetic involvement were observed: presence of periannular pseudoaneurysm with fistulisation towards the right atrium, vegetations and signs of periprosthetic dehiscence.

EVOLUTION
After two weeks of antibiotic therapy with negative blood cultures, valve replacement surgery and repair of the aorto-atrial fistula with pericardial patch was performed. Microbiological analysis of the excised surgical tissue showed abundant polymorphonuclear cells without microorganisms in the Gram stain, and the culture was finally negative.

DIAGNOSIS
Early infective endocarditis on aortic biological prosthesis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Periprosthetic pseudoaneurysm, fistulised to right chambers. Antibiotic and surgical treatment with good evolution.
