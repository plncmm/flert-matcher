We present the case of a 14-year-old male patient with asthma that was difficult to control. His personal history included transient respiratory distress, virus-induced asthma and egg allergy. At the age of four he was diagnosed with seasonal asthma with sensitisation to pollen and was treated with immunotherapy for four years. He improved during the season but respiratory symptoms persisted during the autumn and winter months and he was referred to paediatric pneumology.
During his follow-up, despite adequate treatment and good compliance, a deterioration in lung function was observed with a drop in FEV1 of 11%, so an extensive study was carried out to rule out comorbidities (imaging tests, skin tests, sweat test, immunity study, bacterial sputum cultures and mycobacteria). The results obtained showed total IgE of 1713 U/ml, specific IgE to Aspergillus and positive precipitins, sputum culture and skin test positive for Aspergilus Fumigatus, confirming the diagnosis of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis and initiating treatment with antifungals, corticosteroids and omalizumab.
