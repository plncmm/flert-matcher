Anamnesis
38 year old patient with no known drug allergies and with a personal history that includes a medicated induction with exogenous testorenone for sex change from female to male, pending hysterectomy together with salpingo-oophorectomy and a bilateral mastectomy in 2008, consulted at the Hospital because she noticed a lump in her left breast. She denies previous trauma, no fever, no pain or other symptoms.

Physical examination
Patient with ECOG 0, conscious and oriented; a hard, mobile nodule, about 10mm in diameter, was observed in the superoexternal quadrant of the left breast region. No axillary adenopathy was palpable. Previous mastectomy scars in good condition, with no signs of infection. The rest of the physical examination was unaltered.

Complementary tests
A blood test with tumour markers was carried out, which was found to be within normal parameters. A mammogram was performed, which was found to be pathological, so an ultrasound scan of the breast was performed, which revealed a 9mm irregular hypoechogenic nodule in the superoexternal quadrant of the left breast region, BIRADS 5.
Given the findings, the lesion was biopsied.

Diagnosis
The lesion was biopsied and was positive for infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast grade I, pending determination of progesterone and oestrogen, Ki67 and HER2.

Treatment
With the aforementioned result in the pathological anatomy of the lesion, lumpectomy + sentinel lymph node was performed. The surgical specimen confirmed that it was a grade I infiltrating ductal carcinoma, being a pT1b (10mm) N0(sn) Mx RE 100% RP 70% Ki 67 18% HER2 -, with perineural invasion, with no evidence of lymphatic infiltration or blood vessels, and with free surgical margins of more than 5mm.

Evolution
This is a patient with a diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast pT1b N0(sn) RE 100% RP 70% RP 70% Ki 67 18% HER 2-, with a history of bilateral mastectomy 8 years ago due to sex change from female to male and currently undergoing exogenous testosterone. As adjuvant treatment to surgery, tamoxifen was started and radiotherapy was indicated, and is currently in progress.
