A 56-year-old female patient from the shapono of Niayope in the Sierra de Parima (2o 47 ́21" N, 64o 13 ́55" W, Altitude: 885 masl), Alto Orinoco, Amazonas State, who was referred by the community doctor for presenting pain in the right hypochondrium and hypogastrium of moderate intensity, without extenuating circumstances or concomitants of 6 years of evolution (2003-2009) with a presumptive diagnosis of hepatic cancer. Due to the clinical-epidemiological suspicion and the historical records of cases of hydatidosis in Venezuelan Guayana, it was decided to perform serology to rule out this parasitosis.

For the serological diagnosis of both patients, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the R-50 fraction of a sheep hydatid cyst antigen was used to detect specific IgG antibodies (normal value: optical density (OD) ≤0.170). Western blotting (WB) was performed with the same antigen to detect 6 specific molecules of 15, 20, 21, 29, 35 and 46 kDa (antigen and protocol "in house" Immunology Section of the Institute of Tropical Medicine "Dr. Felix Pifano" (Colmenares et al., 2009). The IgG-Hydatidosis ELISA in the patient's serum was positive, with an O.D. of 1.336. This result was confirmed by WB detecting 4 of 6 specific bands.

The patient was transferred to the Hospital Universitario de Caracas (HUC) where an abdominal echosonogram was performed, showing cystic images in the right hepatic lobe and, in more detail, 19 to 25 well-defined, thin-walled cystic images with an image inside of 19.6 HU in liquid range partially compromising the right hepatic lobe, with displacement to the left of the left hepatic lobe and the abdominal aorta were observed in the Computerised Axial Tomography (CAT).

The patient was medicated with Albendazole 800 mg daily for three months until surgery, which was performed laparoscopically using the puncture, aspiration, instillation and reaspiration (PAIR) technique.

The fluid extracted from the hydatid cysts at the time of surgery was citrine, possibly due to cell death as a result of medical treatment. On microscopic examination (40X), numerous hydatids without movement of the flaming cells were visible and 40 hooks were observed and measured. Morphobiometry was performed on the hooks and an average total size of 40 μ, blade size 24.96 μ and hook shank size of 15.04 μ were obtained, which were characteristic of E. vogeli.

The patient progressed satisfactorily and was treated with albendazole for an additional 3 months and postoperative tomographic control was performed.
