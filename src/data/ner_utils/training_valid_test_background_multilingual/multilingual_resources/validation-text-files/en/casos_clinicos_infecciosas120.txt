A 14-year-old female adolescent, previously healthy, with a clinical picture of six weeks' evolution of intense progressive headache, occipital in location, waking her up at night, referred 10/10 (visual analogue scale), associated vomiting, intermittent low-grade fever, myalgias and arthralgias. She went for medical attention where she was treated for probable pharyngotonsillitis with unspecified antimicrobial treatment. Symptoms persisted, and he was admitted to the National Paediatric Institute for assessment. Initial physical examination revealed only nuchal rigidity, the rest of the neurological examination was normal, arthralgias of both knees without finding phlogosis or a decrease in the arc of movement. Paraclinical tests were performed and it was decided to perform a lumbar puncture on suspicion of neuroinfection. Blood count showed leukocytosis of 21,410/Î¼L at the expense of neutrophilia (80%). Cerebrospinal fluid with microproteins 62 mg/dL, glucose 55 mg/dL (serum 129 mg/dL), slightly xanthochromic appearance, no film, cells 267/mm3, lymphocytes 74% and segmented cells 26%, hospitalisation was decided for surveillance, with a torpid evolution with persistent fever and blurred vision that evolved into amaurosis days later. A new lumbar puncture was decided which reported micro-proteins 56 mg/dL, glucose 37.3 mg/dL, no film and cells 0/mm3. She was assessed by ophthalmology, which reported right optic neuritis and incipient left optic neuritis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion compatible with vasculitis. Topical and intravenous steroids were started with clinical improvement. Due to the time of evolution, microorganisms such as mycobacteria, Cryptococcus neoformans and Borrelia burgdorferi were suspected. Samples were sent for a targeted search of cerebrospinal fluid and blood for mycotic forms, PCR for mycobacteria, ELISA and Western Blot (WB) for Borrelia burgdorferi and empirical treatment was started with ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day. WB and IgG against Borrelia burgdorferi positive in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient progressed satisfactorily, recovered 20/20 bilateral vision, completed the intravenous antibiotic treatment and was discharged to continue ambulatory surveillance.
