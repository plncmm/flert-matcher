A 44-year-old male patient, HIV-positive, on treatment for one year with Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir and undetectable viral load. He presented with fever of two months' duration, erythematous, hot and painful nodules on the right forearm, as well as inflammation and tenosynovitis of the dorsum of the right hand. The rest of the examination was normal.

Complementary tests
Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound: normal,
ANA: positive 1/80 homogeneous pattern, HLA-B51, Anti ENA, ANCA, Ac anti DNA, negative.
CBC: ACE: 82mcg/L, rest normal. Mantoux: positive.
Skin biopsy culture: mycological, mycobacteria and bacilloscopy, negative Pathological anatomy of the skin nodule: Necrotising granulomatous lobular granulomatous panniculitis (presence of acid-fast bacilli).
The patient reported that he had an aquarium at home, so, given the anatomopathological findings and this new data, a very likely entity would be infection by Mycobacterium marinum, and treatment was started with Clarithromycin 500mg/12h, in addition to prophylaxis with Isoniazid 300mg/24h, with resolution of the lesions in almost all cases.
Mycobacterium Marinum infection occurs through skin erosions during the care of domestic aquariums. The most frequent sites are the hands, followed by the forearm and lower extremities. The initial lesion is a violaceous papule, which may progress to erythematous nodules or plaques. They may be solitary or follow a linear course along the lymphatic drainage line. Occasionally, the infection may penetrate into underlying structures such as synovial sacs, or joints, but the lymph nodes are usually not affected.
Histologically, these are tuberculoid granulomas with or without central caseous necrosis. Staining for acid-fast bacilli is usually negative, and culture is necessary to identify the causative germ.
