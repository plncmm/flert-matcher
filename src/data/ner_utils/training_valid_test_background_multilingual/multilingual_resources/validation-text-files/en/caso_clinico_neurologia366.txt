Anamnesis
63-year-old woman, with a personal history of arterial hypertension and epilepsy (complex partial seizures) on treatment with carbamazepine, verbal information from the family, as no clinical follow-up report was available (her usual residence was outside the province). Good seizure control. He had been seizure-free for more than 5 years. Usual treatment: carbamazepine and enalapril. They denied the use of toxic substances. The patient was brought to the emergency department for a clinical picture of inattention and confusion that had been evolving for several hours. For a week she had been experiencing episodes of disconnection from her surroundings lasting a few seconds, with a fixed gaze and repetitive hand movements, which subsided spontaneously, without any other accompanying symptoms. The day after admission she presented two generalised tonic-clonic seizures and right hemiparesis.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 165/92 mmHg, heart rate 73 bpm, temperature 36.2 oC. Neurological examination: tendency to sleep, although awake to verbal stimuli. Inattentive, with need to repeat orders. Understands simple commands, but only few complex ones. Little spontaneous language (single or monosyllabic words). Repeats and names appropriately. Moderate dysarthria. Normal threat campimetry. Right supranuclear facial paresis. Right hemiparesis with crural predominance. Left flexor flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex, right indifferent. Generalised vivid os-teo tendon reflexes. No alterations in sensitivity.

Complementary tests
- Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation: normal.
- Slightly increased liver enzymes: glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase 91 IU/l, glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase 116 IU/l.
- Antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm, anti-Ro, anti-La: negative.
- Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) negative.
- Serology for hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Brucella, Borrelia, cytomegalovirus, herpes, Ebstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus: negative.
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). First analysis: 2 cells, rest normal. Second: normal. Third: normal. Cultures negative. Cytology: absence of neoplastic cells, abundant proteinaceous material with very few normal lymphocytes.
- Transthoracic echocardiography: normal.
- Repeated electroencephalograms (EEG): signs of diffuse cerebral involvement together with the presence of paroxysmal epileptiform abnormalities at the left hemispheric level with no status pattern.
- Supra-aortic trunk Doppler (TSA) and TCD: normal.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT): mild cortico-subcortical atrophy. Subcentimetric hypodense image in the right paramedial margin of the pons, compatible with lacunar infarction. Images suggestive of lacunar infarcts located in both putamen and in the head of the left caudate nucleus. Hypodense images in the white matter, of small size in both cerebral hemispheres suggesting areas of gliosis secondary to multi-infarct disease.
- Cranial CT with contrast: no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Rest of study similar to initial CT scan.
- Cranial CT scan without contrast (3 days after the initial scan): two hypodense lesions were observed at the left frontal and left posterior parietal level, compatible with an acute/sub-acute ischaemic event. 
- Venous MRI angiography: hypoplasia of the sigmoid sinus and left internal jugular vein, with no clear signs of venous thrombosis.
- Cranial MRI: ischaemic lesions at frontal and left parietal level, in the territory of the left MCA. Patchy lesions suggestive of chronic ischaemic lesions, leuko- araiosis and gliosis in the corona radiata, semioval centres, internal capsule and basal ganglia, compatible with small vessel disease. Cranial MRI, FLAIR sequence: bilateral ischaemic lesions compatible with small vessel disease. The diffusion sequence shows a left hemispheric lesion restricting diffusion, compatible with acute infarction in the border area between the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery.
- Arteriography: multifocal stenosis at the level of the small and medium-sized bihemispheric arteries, suggestive of cerebral vasculitis. Arteriography image in lateral projection, showing small areas of stenosis at the level of the small and medium calibre vessels, suggestive of vasculitis.
- Right temporal biopsy (including superficial temporal artery, dura mater and cortex of the right anterior temporal pole): no remarkable findings.

Evolution
During admission to Neurology, he presented complex partial seizures lasting minutes with clonus of the right limbs and secondary generalisation. LEV was introduced without response, presenting on the third day with three generalised tonic-clonic seizures in one hour, without recovery of the level of consciousness, compatible with status convulsus, for which she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). During her stay in the ICU she required sedation with midazolam together with treatment with LEV, PTH, LCS, CBZ, without seizure control and persistence of clonus in the right hemiface. He required invasive mechanical ventilation. He also presented infectious complications. He suffered nosocomial pneumonia, which was treated with cloxacillin and meropenem due to gram-negative bacilli and coccobacilli isolation. As for the neurological situation, the clonus in the right hemicara was controlled with the aforementioned antiepileptic treatment, and it was possible to withdraw BZD. As a result of the clinical evolution, with seizures that were difficult to control and the presence of diffuse ischaemic lesions on neuroimaging, an angiographic study was performed on suspicion of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. The findings supported the diagnosis and treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g for 5 days and a subsequent course of 60 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/day was started. Initially, the clinical situation of the patient improved progressively, recovering the level of consciousness, directing the gaze and mobilising the right limbs, and extubation was possible. She remained mute with episodes of agitation. He was transferred again to the neurology ward after a month in the ICU. On the ward, she suffered two episodes of reversible respiratory arrest without cardiorespiratory arrest (CRP), and on a third occasion she presented cardiorespiratory arrest for about 15 minutes; after resuscitation manoeuvres, vital signs were recovered, although the patient remained in vegetative coma with subsequent development of postanoxic encephalopathy and EEG pattern without cortical activity. After almost 3 months in hospital, she presented a new CRA and died. The family did not agree to a necropsy.
