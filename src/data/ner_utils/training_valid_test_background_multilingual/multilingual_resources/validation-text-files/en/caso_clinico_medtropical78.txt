A 20-year-old male, with no relevant medical history, born and residing in Loreto, Amazon region of Peru. He reported that nine months earlier he had presented petechial, erythematous, circular, pruritic lesions with well-defined borders on his legs, associated with pruritus in the plantar area, which later became generalised. Three months later, he began military service in Lima, where the pruritus was exacerbated and the number of lesions on the upper and lower extremities increased. Four months later, general malaise and intermittent fever up to 40°C were added. He went to a health facility in Rimac, Lima where he was given metamizole intramuscularly. He continued with this medication for two months; however, due to the non-remission of fever and the progression of the lesions, he consulted our hospital.

The patient was admitted in stable general condition. On physical examination he presented maculopapular, erythematous, circular, confluent, confluent, maculopapular lesions with well-defined, wine-red, palpable borders that did not disappear with acupressure. They were approximately 0.3 x 0.3 cm each, located on the upper and lower extremities, trunk, abdomen and periumbilical region, which caused intense itching. No gastrointestinal symptoms.

The haemogram showed a hypereosinophilia of 50% (absolute eosinophils: 6,480 cells/mm3), with normal leukocyte and lymphocyte counts. The diagnoses of vascular purpura and non-specific parasitosis were raised. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) of 609.8 IU/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.63 mg/L, and viral serological tests (HIV, HTLV-1, HCV, HBsAg) and VDRL were negative.

Symptomatic treatment was started with chlorphenamine i.v. Parasitological examination of stool showed Strongyloides stercoralis larvae. Ivermectin 200 μg/kg/day was started for two days. In addition, cysts of Entamoeba coli and Iodamoeba bustchilli were identified, so he received albendazole 400 mg, once a day, for seven days. Subsequently, ivermectin 200 ug/kg/day was administered for two more days, seven days after the first dose.

After 15 days of treatment, the number of skin lesions decreased significantly, although they maintained a punctiform pattern on the lower limbs and dorsum. For this reason, topical methylprednisolone aceponate was added. In addition, during this period, a skin biopsy was obtained which identified a lymphocytic infiltrate without the identification of larvae. In relation to control tests, on the seventh day of treatment, eosinophil levels decreased to 24% (1,685 cells/mm3); and at 15 days, they decreased to 9% (645 cells/mm3), while IgE decreased to 461 IU/mL.

One month after treatment, skin manifestations were scarce. A serial parasitological examination of control faeces showed Hymenolepis nana, so he received albendazole 400 mg daily for five days, praziquantel 25 mg/kg in a single dose and nitazoxanide 500 mg, twice daily, for three days. IgE levels in a third control were 357.6 IU/mL. At the end of treatment, a new serial parasitological examination did not identify parasite infestation. Finally, after two and a half months of treatment, she was discharged with a diagnosis of resolved Strongyloides stercoralis reactive purpura.
