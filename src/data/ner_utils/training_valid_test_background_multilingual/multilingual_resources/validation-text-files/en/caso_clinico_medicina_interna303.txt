Reason for consultation: 21-year-old woman admitted for progressive loss of strength in the left lower limb.

Personal history: Allergy to milk, egg, kiwi and strawberries. NAMC. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Repeated bronchitis. Intervention at 12 years of age for left pleural empyema, after pneumonia.

Present illness: 15 days of fever, cough and expectoration, which partially improved with bronchodilator and antibiotic treatment. At the same time, he began to notice weakness in the left lower limb, which has progressively worsened, and he was admitted to Neurology for this reason. Physical examination: Haemodynamically stable. Afebrile. Thin. Multiple warty lesions on both hands, hyperkeratotic lesions on the neck, abdomen and chest. Pulmonary auscultation: roncus and bilateral rales up to midfields. Cardiac auscultation, abdomen and EIA were normal. Neurologically: Claudication of left extremities in Barr√© and Mingazzini. In the left upper limb, proximal strength of 4/5 and distal strength of 4-/5. In the left lower limb, proximal strength of 4/5 and distal strength of 2/5. Generalised hyperreflexia with increased reflexogenic area. Left Babinski.

Complementary tests
Normal haemogram and coagulation. Biochemistry: total proteins 5.1 gr/dl, rest normal.
Immunoglobins: IgG 476 mg/dl, IgA, IgE and IgM: normal. IgG-1: 396; IgG-2.97, IgG-3.41, IgG-4.4.
Proteinogram: hypogammaglobulinaemia. IgG Lambda monoclonal band in late gamma.
CSF: Inflammatory profile. ADA 6 U/l. Bands: Pattern compatible with intrathecal synthesis of IgG in systemic disease. Cytology: negative for malignancy. Culture: negative. Serology (HIV, HSV, lupus and Borrelia): negative. JC virus PCR: 331 copies/mm3.
Serology (HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, Brucella, Borrelia and Lues): negative. Positive IgG HSV and VZV.
CAT scan: findings compatible with viral infectious process.
Cranial CT: small hypodensity in frontal and right periventricular white matter, without enhancement after contrast administration.
Cranial MRI: Compatible as a first possibility with demyelinating disease of the CNS.
Brain MRI with spectroscopy technique: data consistent with clinical and analytical suspicion of PML.

Evolution: During admission he suffered an episode of acute respiratory distress that required admission to the ICU. As the days went by, thermoalgesic sensitivity was affected and strength worsened in the left upper limb. He was initially treated with methylprednisolone without improvement. After receiving a positive CSF PCR for JC virus, treatment was started with Cidofovir, intravenous immunoglubulins and mefloquine with little improvement.

Diagnostic Judgement
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
- Combined immunodeficiency, with hypogammaglobulinemia at the expense of
IgG and IgM.
