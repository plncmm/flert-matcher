A 59 year old man was admitted to the hospital to be studied for asthenia, anorexia, febrile fever and dry cough of 4 weeks' duration. No fever, shivering or other associated symptoms. Background history: AHT, LBP, hypothyroidism, OSA in treatment with CPAP, stable ischaemic heart disease with LVEF of 30%, papillary urothelial carcinoma treated with BCG (attenuated mycobacterium bovis) in October 2018 (two months before the onset of the symptoms).
Physical examination revealed only pharyngo-tonsillar erythema.
Laboratory tests showed CRP1 4.52mg/dL and ferritin 1542 ng/mL, the rest was unremarkable. Serology: negative. Chest X-ray: peri-bronchovascular thickening. IGRA: positive. Thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan: diffuse and bilateral nodular pattern in lung parenchyma that may correspond to miliary TB. No lymphadenopathy or involvement of the pleural space. Discrete homogeneous splenomegaly. Serology was negative. Bronchoscopy was performed and nodular images were observed in the mucosa of the LSI. Bronchoaspirate culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis with positive PCR2 Tuberculosis complex (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, africanum, bovis and bovis BCG). LBA was also performed with gram stain, bacteriological culture and culture for mycobacteria, Ziehl-Neelsen and Auramine stain, all results being negative. Bone marrow aspirate was performed and PCR2 multiplex tuberculosis was positive and culture for mycobacteria where Mycobasterium bovis BCG grew. A diagnosis of disseminated infection by atypical mycobacteria secondary to endovesical BCG instillation for treatment of urothelial carcinoma and reactivation of latent mycobacterium tuberculosis was made.
Treatment was started with Rifampicin + Ethambutol + Isoniazid and pyrazinamide for 2 months and then 4 months with double antibiotherapy with good progress so far.
Both reactivation of latent TB and disseminated infection by attenuated mycobacterium bovis after instillation of BCG for treatment of urothelial carcinoma have been described in the literature as rare but potentially fatal complications of this treatment. Even rarer are the cases in which the causative mycobacterium has been isolated by culture, and empirical treatment with antituberculosis drugs based on clinical suspicion is the usual management.
