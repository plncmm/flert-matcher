Anamnesis
A 36-year-old woman from Guinea. She was treated with doxycycline at the age of 20. No family history of cancer.
Present illness: three days after arriving in Spain, she went to the emergency department for a painless tumour in the nose which had developed over three months and which has progressively increased to measure 4 x 5cm. She has lost approximately 10 kg in weight in two months. In addition, she presents dyspnoea with moderate exertion. She refers to risky sexual activity.

Physical examination
Temperature 37.9 oC, BP 100/50 mm Hg, HR 104 bpm, Sat 97 %. Pharynx with presence of red-violaceous tumours all over the soft palate, cervical and submandibular adenopathies. Large, lobulated, exophytic, red-violaceous nasal tumour. CA: rhythmic. AP: preserved vesicular murmur. ABD: soft without masses or megaliths. On the left lower extremity, there was woody oedema up to the knee. Hypopigmented lesions in the pretibial region, reddish warty lesions on the sole of the foot. Hypervascularised macular lesions on the right knee.

Complementary tests
"CBC: anodyne except for CRP: 56.80 mg/l (less than 5). RPR-, IgG toxo+, IgG CMV+, anti-HCV-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+, HBsAg-, anti-HAV+. In addition, brucellosis, Rickettsia, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella and Plasmodium falciparum were ruled out.
"He was HIV positive with 375 CD4 and 41,000 viral load. He had no mutations in transcriptase inhibitors.
"Chest X-ray: interstitial infiltrates predominantly in upper and posterior lobes, mainly in LSI in the form of atelectasis.
"Echo Doppler of the left lower limb showing extensive thrombus in the common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein and left popliteal vein.
"Complete coagulation study with no relevant findings.
"Sputum x 3: Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated.
"CT scan: lung with multiple and diffuse foci of bilateral pseudonodular consolidations, cavitated or with a tendency to cavitation, predominantly in the upper lobes and upper segments of the lower lobes. Multiple bilateral hilar reactive adenopathies and in the subcarinal space.
"Skin biopsy of the knee and nose: proliferation of spindle cells with atypia and mitosis, together with vascular clefts and haematic extravasation can be seen in the dermis. They show immunoexpression for HHV-8. Diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Diagnosis
"HIV disease, stage C2. (375 CD4 and 41000 CV); MAR HLA B5701 negative. RPR-, IgG toxo+, IgG CMV+, anti-HCV-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+, HBsAg-, anti-HAV+. raltegravir (RAL), tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC).
"Pulmonary tuberculosis.
"Kaposi's sarcoma stage IV.
" Common femoral, superficial and lower popliteal deep vein thrombosis.

Treatment
The patient, while in respiratory isolation, started treatment with ethambutol, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. After two weeks of tuberculostatics, antiretroviral therapy was started with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir (the latter in double doses due to its interaction with rifampicin, which induces the enzyme that metabolises cytochrome P450 drugs). Due to possible interactions and in anticipation of starting oncology treatment, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin was discontinued, and on 7/10/16 she started palliative oncology treatment with the pegylated (sic) Adria (Caelyx®) scheme (Caelyx®) of which she received 7 cycles until 30/5/2017. The dose has had to be delayed several times due to G3 neutropenia.

Evolution
The patient, after 7 cycles of treatment, has shown an almost complete response in all lesions: particularly noteworthy is the significant improvement in the nose lesion despite the delays. She is currently awaiting assessment by Dermatology with a view to performing cosmetic surgery on the nasal lesion. In addition, the patient has presented G:3 neutropenia and her dose has had to be delayed several times, requiring support with filgrastim. She complies well with antiretroviral therapy.
