A 29-year-old woman was referred from the penitentiary centre for fever of 3 weeks' duration and pain in the right flank. No known drug allergies. Drug addict. Supracondylar amputation of the left lower limb was performed in 2008 with subsequent infections and improvement after antibiotics. In 2009, a 20 cm retroperitoneal cystic mass was diagnosed, with drainage of 5 litres of purulent material and growth of E. coli, with follow-up by urology for surgical assessment. The patient did not keep her appointments. On arrival at the emergency department for the current process, the patient was afebrile and her BP was 115/80. On examination, the presence of a large, hard, non-painful abdominal mass on the right flank, measuring about 20 cm, attracted attention. Laboratory tests showed: Hb: 9.4; Hct: 27.1; platelets: 161,000; leukocytes: 16,040 (N: 14,830, L: 750); glucose: 113, urea: 56; creatinine: 0.98; GOT: 60; LDH: 217. Abdominal-pelvic CT scan was requested: the right kidney was not visualised. A large right retroperitoneal cystic mass measuring 21 x 16 x 14 cm was observed. These findings correspond to a large abscess on the remaining kidney. There were no other findings of interest. The patient worsened and was admitted to the emergency department for observation, where a peak fever of 39.7oC was observed, with tachycardia at 160 bpm, hypotension and deterioration of general condition and tachypnoea. Treatment was started with intensive serum therapy, antibiotics (piperacillin-4 g- tazobaztam) and vasoactive drugs (noradrenaline) to raise blood pressure. It was decided that the patient should be admitted to the ICU, but first the drainage of the abscess had to be "negotiated" from the emergency department. It was decided to drain the retroperitoneal abscess by interventional radiology guided by CT. > 4 litres of purulent material were extracted and a sample was sent to microbiology. It was finally decided to admit the patient to the ICU and once she was stabilised, a right nephrectomy was performed due to pyonephrosis, with a good evolution.
