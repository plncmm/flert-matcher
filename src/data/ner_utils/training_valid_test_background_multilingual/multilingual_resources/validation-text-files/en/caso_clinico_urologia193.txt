Anamnesis
74-year-old male with the following personal history: no known allergic drug reactions; denies toxic habits; hypertension under treatment; type II diabetes mellitus; obesity; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol; double mitral valve lesion; obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome; stage 3 chronic kidney disease; hyperuricaemia with podagra crisis; polyarthrosis; essential tremor and septic shock of pulmonary origin two years ago. Operated for left knee prosthesis 4 years ago. Operated for bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. Usual treatment: enalapril 20 mg, tamsulosin, torasemide 5 mg, pramipexol, acenocoumarol 4 mg as prescribed, allopurinol 300 mg, bisoprolol fumarate 10 mg, pantoprazole 20 mg, metformin 850 mg, lercanidipine hydrochloride 20 mg.
The patient came to the Emergency Department with general malaise of 2 hours' duration, accompanied by dysthermic sensation without thermometry, nausea without vomiting and micturition symptoms consisting of pollakiuria, with no other symptoms.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 164/97 mmHg; heart rate 69 bpm; temperature 37.5 oC. Conscious and oriented in all three spheres. Mucocutaneous dryness. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic and without murmurs or superimposed noises. Pulmonary auscultation with preserved vesicular murmur and absence of adventitial sounds. Abdominal air sounds present and of normal intensity. Abdomen soft and depressible, not painful on palpation, no signs of peritonism, no palpable masses or megaliths. Irreducible right inguinoscrotal hernia, irreducible left inguinal hernia. Negative bilateral renal fist percussion. Rectal examination: prostate with regular edges, non-painful, no faeces in the rectal ampulla. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

Complementary tests
● Blood tests: leukocytosis of 15.74 103/μl, with neutrophilia (89.40%), increased acute phase reactants and impaired renal function with urea 71 mg/dl and creatinine 1.60 mg/dl.
Urine system: pH 5.5, density 1.010 g/l, protein 20 mg/dl; glucose negative; ketone bodies negative; bilirubin 0 mg/dl; urobilinogen negative; nitrites positive; leucocytes 500 cells/μl; red blood cells 300 cells/μl.
Urgent sediment: > 100 leucocytes/field, isolated b-tract cells and bacteriuria.
● Blood and urine cultures: multisensitive Escherichia coli.

Treatment
The patient was diagnosed with complicated urinary tract infection, and treatment was started with ceftriaxone 1 g/12 hours intravenously, and the patient was kept under observation to assess the response to treatment, despite which the clinical manifestations and fever persisted.
Given the patient's history, and given the worsening renal function of the patient, whose baseline serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl, it was decided to request an abdominal-pelvic ultrasound, which revealed hydronephrosis in the right kidney with grade III pyelocaliceal ectasia, with dilatation of the ureter in its course, leading to the inguinal region, where the patient had a recurrent inguino-scrotal hernia; In the juxtavesical region, the ureter was of normal calibre. In order to assess a possible compromise of the urinary tract as the cause of acute renal failure, it was decided to request a CT scan, which showed obstructive uropathy with grade III hydronephrosis and significant dilatation of the right ureter until it reached a voluminous inguinal hernia, where it was lodged; at the exit of the hernia there was a change in calibre causing the pathology, which led to a delay in the elimination of the kidney and a left inguinal hernia with fatty content. The patient required hospital admission and intravenous antibiotherapy.

Diagnosis
● Febrile urinary tract infection.
● Grade III right ureterohydronephrosis due to herniation of the right ureter.
● Recurrent bilateral inguinal hernia.

Evolution
Three months later the patient underwent surgical treatment, being performed:
● Hernioplasty with 30 x 30 polypropylene mesh via preperitoneal route according to Stoppa technique, through infraumbilical median laparotomy incision.
Catheterisation of the right ureteral meatus with placement of a double J 6 x 30 catheter.
After surgery, the patient recovered his baseline serum creatinine levels to around 1.3-1.5 mg/dl, and was discharged 4 days after surgery. In the early postoperative period he presented a haematoma in the surgical region and scrotal oedema. Four weeks after surgery, the double J catheter was removed without incident. The patient's evolution has been satisfactory.
