A 36-year-old woman, with no previous history of interest. Married with one healthy child, she lives in a rural area near the capital of the island of Gran Canaria. The patient was brought to the emergency department on several occasions due to a progressive clinical picture of 15 days' evolution of behavioural and intellectual alterations consisting of psychomotor agitation, stereotyped movements of the upper limbs and verbal stereotypies together with recurrent periods of active mutism. She was assessed at the Mental Health Unit and hospital admission was decided in order to rule out organic causes for a probable conversive disorder. In the absence of evidence of organicity and a normal CT scan in the emergency department, the patient was admitted to the Psychiatry Department, where she developed a severe progressive deterioration of coordination and language, with generalised myoclonus. A week after admission, she developed episodes of sweating, fever and bronchial secretions, associated with increased agitation, which led to consultation with Internal Medicine, who assessed the patient and extended the study. The general physical examination was normal. The neurological examination revealed an autistic attitude with no connection to the environment, frontal release reflexes and no motor deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis obtained by lumbar puncture revealed the presence of 60 predominantly mononuclear cells with glucose and proteins in the normal range. Given the liquor findings in the context of encephalopathic symptoms, parameningeal, toxic-metabolic and infectious causes were investigated. Among the complementary tests carried out, the electroencephalographic findings stood out, which repeatedly showed slowing of cortical activity, with a theta-wave base rhythm. Brain MRI showed mild left temporal atrophy, with a normal brain CT scan. Laboratory tests (except for CK of 770 U/L) and lumbar puncture performed one week later (without any treatment) were normal, with negative results in microbiological studies (VDRL, PCR for HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV, HVH-6 and BK virus) and prion protein investigation. The investigation of usual toxins in blood and urine was negative. After two months of admission with partial improvement on treatment with neuroleptics and dopaminergic drugs, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute encephalopathy of non-filial origin with residual neuropsychological deterioration of frontal pattern. The patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for follow-up, during which the results of the serology requested during admission were received, showing positive anti-Coxiella burnetti (FC) Ac 1/64, positive IgG IFI Ac (phase I) Coxiella burnetti 1/320, and positive IgG IFI Ac (phase II) Coxiella burnetti > 1/320, compatible with the acute phase of Q fever, which, together with the unfavourable evolution of the symptoms, led to the patient's readmission. Treatment with doxycycline was prescribed, despite which no clinical improvement was observed. Imaging findings (CT, MRI and brain SPECT) were not significant. In this context, the possible concomitance of other factors of neuronal toxicity that could explain the lack of resolution of the picture was considered. An organic and inorganic toxicity study was performed, the results of which revealed the presence of Lindane in blood (2.247 mg/L), hair (0.420 mg/g) and urine (0.288 mg/L). After discharge, the patient was closely followed up in outpatient clinics, with the clinical picture slowly evolving towards a progressive improvement, and the patient was neurologically asymptomatic 15 months after the onset of symptoms.
