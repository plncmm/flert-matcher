A 57-year-old man with no history of respiratory failure presented to the emergency department in Hunan (China) with haemoptysis of 3 hours' duration. He denied recent travel to Wuhan, Wuhan province, or any exposure to 2019-nCoV. Laboratory tests on admission were not indicative. A plain chest CT scan showed a localised area of ground-glass opacities in the apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe. 

Radiological findings on admission
A plain chest CT scan showed a localised area of ground-glass opacities in the apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe. The distribution of the lesions was mainly medial. No lesions were observed in other regions of the lungs.
The patient was admitted to hospital with suspected pulmonary infection or tuberculosis. Three days after admission, a small amount of pleural effusion was observed. No positive results were found on drainage of the pleural effusion. The haemoptysis could not be controlled with symptomatic treatment, including haemostasis and anti-infective therapy. Eight days later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the ground-glass opacities of the left upper lobe had progressed to consolidations. 
Radiological findings on the 8th day after admission
Chest CT showed that the ground-glass opacities of the left upper lobe had changed to consolidations. New ground-glass opacities were observed in the lingual segment of the left upper lobe and the upper segment of the left lower lobe distributed in subpleural regions.
Ground-glass opacities appeared in the upper segment of the left lower lobe. On day 10 after admission, haemorrhage in the apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe was confirmed by fibrobronchoscopy. The patient presented fever on day 11 and reached a maximum temperature of 39oC. On day 14 he presented dyspnoea, which progressively worsened. On day 18 after admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe had decreased, while diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidations increased in the remaining areas of the lungs. The patient showed diffuse infiltrates in both lungs, with butterfly wing pattern and cobblestone pattern, as well as air bronchogram. Ground-glass opacities were distributed in the peripheral or subpleural regions. 
Radiological findings on day 18 after admission 
On day 18, the initial ground-glass opacities and consolidations in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe had decreased, while diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidations increased in the remaining areas of the lungs, with diffuse infiltrates and butterfly-wing pattern. A cobblestone pattern and air bronchogram were seen. Some ground-glass opacities were distributed in the peripheral or subpleural regions.
COVID-19 infection was finally confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Haemoptysis gradually improved and dyspnoea was mitigated with symptomatic treatment and antiviral therapy, according to the guidelines for COVID-19. A chest CT scan showed that the consolidations in both lungs had absorbed; by day 24, the area with ground-glass opacities had increased, but their density had decreased.
Radiological findings on day 24 after admission 
On day 24 the consolidations had clearly absorbed. The area with ground glass opacities had increased, but their density had decreased. Some ground glass opacities were mixed with small patchy consolidations.
On day 29 after admission, ground glass opacities and a small consolidation core were still absorbing. The ground-glass opacities of the first CT and the ground-glass opacities and consolidations of the second CT in the apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe had clearly absorbed.
Radiological findings on the 29th day after admission 
On day 29, ground-glass opacities and a small consolidation nucleus were still absorbing. The ground-glass opacities of the first CT and the ground-glass opacities and consolidations of the second CT in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe had clearly absorbed.
