29-year-old woman with no personal or family history of interest. She lived in a rural environment, without pets. She denied travelling abroad and no dietary/medicinal transgressions. No other epidemiological history of interest.
She initially attended the emergency department for abdominal pain of one week's evolution, predominantly in the right hypochondrium. She was associated with general malaise, nausea and choluria. No fever or other symptoms in the anamnesis by organs and apparatus.
Examination revealed mucocutaneous jaundice and pain on palpation of the right hypochondrium. He had chronic scratching lesions on the trunk and abdomen.
Laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.18 mg/dl (direct 2.87 mg/dl), GOT 444 mg/dl, GGT 183 mg/dl and alkaline phosphatase 239 mg/dl, the rest normal. An abdominal ultrasound was also requested, which revealed the presence of a large trabeculated cyst in the left hepatic lobe (10x11 cm), compatible in the first place with hydatid cyst.
During his admission, serologies for hepatotropic viruses and HIV were performed, all of which were negative. CT, abdominal MRI and cholangio-MRI showed a large multitabular cystic formation in segment IV of the liver with dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile duct and secondary cholestasis due to extrinsic compression of the mass. Finally, serology for Echinococcus granulosus was requested and was positive (IgG), giving the key to the diagnosis.
The patient was treated with Albendazole 400mg/12h and is currently awaiting surgery to remove the cyst.
