The patient and his environment Luis is a male patient aged 23 years at the time of the first psychiatric consultation. He lives in an urban area, has completed secondary education and above average academic performance. He has worked as a labourer in construction, with a last job six months before the first consultation. No relevant personal history and no previous psychiatric consultations. No signs of personality disorder and with adequate psychosocial functioning in the year prior to the onset of symptoms. He is the fourth of five siblings. The grandmother on the paternal side suffered from schizophrenia. A brother, who lives with the patient, is also being treated for schizophreniform disorder associated with substance abuse. The father died four years earlier due to a stroke. The mother is blind and requires support for housework, which has been provided by the patient until the current episode. The primary relative is one of the siblings.

Substance use
At the age of 14, Luis started smoking tobacco and hashish, according to the family "because of frequenting bad company". Between the age of 16 and the first psychiatric consultation at 23, he smoked between 6 and 7 joints of hashish every day. According to the patient, he smoked hashish because "I was looking for tranquillity, it makes me laugh...". He has sporadically used marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and speed. He consumes alcohol in moderation. He has never used LSD or heroin. No behavioural addictions.

Clinic
Urgent referral to the Addictive Behaviour Unit from Primary Care "due to a problem of marijuana use, antisocial behaviour and lately aggressive behaviour towards his mother". The family reports that he has been increasingly isolated for approximately four months, at home he is seen talking and laughing alone. He has notably neglected his personal hygiene. He has been repeatedly reported for minor offences in the neighbourhood. On first examination he is uncooperative and shows a paranoid, hostile and oppositional attitude, with poor contact. Language is disjointed, with logical associations. It is not possible to explore mental contents due to lack of collaboration. No reference to delusional contents of thought. In a new retrospective assessment seven months later, with total remission of the symptoms, no hallucinatory symptoms were noted at any time during the course of the patient's evolution, nor were there any signs of delirious clinical manifestations in the past.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis
According to DSM-IV-TR, the following criteria for schizophrenia are met:
- A(4): catatonic or severely disorganised behaviour.
- A (5): negative symptoms (social withdrawal).
- B: social/occupational dysfunction.
- D: exclusion of schizoaffective and mood disorders.

Criterion C (duration of at least 6 months) and E (exclusion of substance use and medical illness) are not met. Since the association of the psychiatric symptoms with substance use is evident (which according to clinical judgement is considered to be a causal relationship, with cannabis use being the cause and psychosis the effect), the differential diagnosis with a cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is considered. However, criterion A of this diagnostic entity (hallucinations or delusions) is not met, but rather the psychotic symptoms in this patient have been predominantly hebephrenic with disorganisation of behaviour, affectivity and language. Therefore, a diagnosis of unspecified cannabis-related disorder (F12.9) is made. According to ICD-10, a diagnosis of Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with predominantly polymorphic symptoms (F12.53) can be made, considering the disorganised symptomatology and in the absence of hallucinations or delirium.

Treatment and course
Risperidone (4 mg/day) was initially prescribed, which the patient did not take due to refusal of treatment. After assertive outpatient follow-up, a month after the first consultation, depot treatment with fluphenazine decanoate (12.5 mg/month) was started. Two weeks after the first injection, contact has improved significantly, hostility and paranoidism have disappeared and he is cooperative. After the second injection, a slight akathisia appeared, so regular clinical follow-up was agreed with the patient, but without pharmacological treatment. From the first interview, motivational treatment was given to stop using cannabis, stressing the probable causal relationship with the psychotic symptoms. The patient reported having stopped using hashish from the first follow-up. At eight months of follow-up, six months after the last administration of antipsychotic treatment (fluphenazine decanoate), he is asymptomatic, with adequate affectivity and no formal thought disorders. The family reports that his behaviour is normal, although he has not tried to look for work again, has few social relations and "spends a lot of time looking out of the window". A urine tox screen was performed, which was negative for THC, cocaine, opioids and amphetamine. Some family members request a psychiatric report for the recognition of a disability entitling them to a pension. Others disagree, stating that "to give him a pension would be to kill this boy in life". Finally, it was decided not to apply for disability recognition and to start a psychosocial rehabilitation programme with the aim of a quick return to normal work. Likewise, motivational treatment is maintained in order to remain abstinent from toxic substances and monitoring for the early detection of possible psychotic prodromes.
