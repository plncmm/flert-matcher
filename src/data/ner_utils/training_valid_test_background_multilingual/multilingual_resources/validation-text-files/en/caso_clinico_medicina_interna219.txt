A 40-year-old male butcher, hypertensive with associated hypercalciuria, obese (BMI 30kg/m2), with no toxic habits, with a family history of maternal childhood tuberculosis. The patient consulted for an inflammatory mass in the right rib cage, without pain, cough, fever or constitutional syndrome. After two weeks with anti-inflammatory drugs without improvement, a puncture and drainage was performed, and the smear test was negative but the culture was positive for multisensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Subsequently, a thoracoabdominal CT scan showed a 2mm subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe, ipsilateral pleural thickening and calcifications, an air cavity secondary to drainage in the lateral wall and small mediastinal adenopathies. When the culture was positive one month later, he started treatment with Rifater, after 2 months it was replaced by Rifaldin, at 4 months the rib access had a complete closure and the X-ray showed a minimal rib irregularity and a hyperdense focus in the 7th and 6th rib respectively, compatible with secondary fractures. In successive check-ups, uric acid (8mg/dl) and triglycerides (191mg/dl) were elevated, compatible with good adherence to treatment, with normalisation after completion.
