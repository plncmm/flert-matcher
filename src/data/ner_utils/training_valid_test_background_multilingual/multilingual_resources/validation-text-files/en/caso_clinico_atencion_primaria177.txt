Reason for consultation
The patient went to his GP because the previous morning he had gone to the emergency department for conjunctival jaundice, previously reporting only a feeling of general malaise, without fever. Stools with some acolia and, in the last 48 hours, choluria.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests)
Conscious, oriented. Good general condition. Conjunctival and cutaneous jaundice. ACR: normal. Abdomen: normal. MII: normal. Neurological: normal. Laboratory results: CBC normal. Biochemistry normal, except: bilirubin 15.41, got: 1622, gpt: 2617. Coagulation: normal Given the parameters of hepatic cholestasis with hyperbilirubinaemia at the expense of direct and intense hypertransaminemia, ultrasound was performed with a probable diagnosis of infectious hepatitis.

Complementary tests
Given the parameters of hepatic cholestasis with hyperbilirubinaemia at the expense of direct and intense hypertransaminemia, an ECOGRAPHY is requested to evaluate a possible obstructive pattern.
The results of the abdominal ultrasound were normal; compatible with acute hepatitis, viriasis. The diagnosis was therefore: INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS.

The family has a family history of cancer: the paternal grandfather was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of 75 and the maternal grandmother with endometrial cancer at the age of 82, now deceased. The maternal grandfather is hypertensive, the maternal grandmother is 67 years old and was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 45, which was cured by partial colectomy. The maternal aunt died at the age of 49 due to Endometrial Cancer and the mother of the son is diagnosed with small intestine cancer.

We contacted the preventive doctor to warn of an outbreak of this disease along with the measures that the patient had to be concerned about taking on a day-to-day basis.

Once the patient has been diagnosed in the emergency department and everything that has been done in the department has been explained, he/she goes to the primary care clinic and a thorough medical history is taken: dietary transgressions, other accompanying symptoms in addition to those mentioned above, constitutional symptoms, taking drugs or herbal products, travelling to other countries or elsewhere. Risky sexual relations with your partner or other relationship. Complete blood test (liver function + renal function + coagulation) + serology.

Serology at 5 days: HIV: Negative CMV: IgG positive, IgM negative. EBV: Ig G positive, Ig M negative HERPES: IgG positive, Ig M negative. Syphilis: Negative. Hepatitis C virus antibodies: negative. After the diagnosis of Acute Hepatitis B, much more research was carried out on the clinical history to see if there were any other details that we had missed or if the patient had told the half-truth. It was discovered that his partner had the same symptoms and also had the same diagnosis.

Family and community approach
Family structure not well consolidated; in particular between mother and son; due to the sexual condition of her son. The father has a good relationship with the son, but between mother and son there are conflicts in the coexistence and in the ways of thinking of each one. The family environment has a family history of oncology. We consider the differential diagnosis between Hereditary Syndrome (Lynch Syndrome) vs Icteric Syndromes (probable infectious aetiologies, etc.).

Clinical judgement (list of problems, differential diagnosis)
Indirectly predominant jaundice. Intrahepatic: Hepatitis. Cirrhosis. Oral contraceptives. U Extrahepatic: Choledocholithiasis. Pancreatic cancer, etc.
