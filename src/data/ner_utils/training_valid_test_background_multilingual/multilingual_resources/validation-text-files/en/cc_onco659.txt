Anamnesis
A 54-year-old man with a personal history of mental retardation with 55% disability and idiopathic generalised epilepsy being monitored by Neurology and under home treatment with carbamazepine. Family oncological history: brother died of lung cancer, another brother under treatment for lung cancer and father died of laryngeal cancer.
In October, the patient came to the emergency department for constitutional syndrome accompanied by abdominal pain and numerous episodes of diarrhoea lasting two weeks. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed multiple liver lesions suggestive of metastasis in an enlarged liver and a chest X-ray showed a rounded, well-defined mass in the lower lobe of the right lung. Laboratory tests showed slightly increased liver enzymes and haemoglobin (hb) of 11.9 g/dl. In view of the data obtained, it was decided to admit him to the Digestive Department for further investigation.
During his stay in the Digestive Department, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen was performed, reporting findings compatible with neoplasia of the lower lobe of the right lung measuring 6.5 cm in diameter, liver metastases and lymphadenopathy at the level of the celiac trunk. A core needle biopsy (CNB) of the liver was requested.
Given the persistence and frequency of the number of stools, a detailed study of possible causes was carried out, with negative results for malabsorption/digestion disorder, coeliac disease, stool culture and Clostridium difficile toxin. Colonoscopy was then performed, with limitations due to poor preparation, but no gross alterations were observed.
In a stable condition, and pending the results of hepatic AGB, the patient was discharged.
In December, the patient returned to the Emergency Department for moderate rectorrhagia, where a rectal examination was performed with no evidence of spontaneous bleeding except for a thrombosed haemorrhoid, and anaemia (Hb 8.1 g/dl) was observed in the ED analysis, requiring transfusion of red blood cell concentrate. The patient was admitted to the oncology ward with a histopathological diagnosis of metastasis of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour with a proliferative index (Ki 67) of 2% and the following immunohistochemical profile: positive for CKAE1/CK19, chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negative for EMA, TTF-1, CDX2, D2-40, HepPar-1, CK5/6, CK7, CK20, PAS. Doubtful: CD56, CEA.
An OctreoscanÂ® test was performed, which showed pathological uptake of the tracer in liver and lung parenchyma, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was requested in 24-hour urine, while the first dose of octreotide LAR 30 mg every 28 days was started.
The patient began with very florid symptoms; accentuated central thoracic pain without irradiation, ruling out ischaemic causes; in addition to oedema in the slavina, flushing, dyspnoea and jugular ingurgitation, for which reason a chest CT angiography was performed, ruling out superior vena cava syndrome and echocardiography, which reported severe tricuspid insufficiency. The case was discussed with Cardiology and the patient did not require surgical treatment.
Given the high suspicion of carcinoid syndrome (although pending 5-HIAA), and difficult symptom control, especially diarrhoea and central thoracic pain with flushing, the case was discussed with the Endocrinology Department, which indicated continuing with octreotide LAR 30 mg but reducing the administration time to 21 days, and octreotide 100 mg subcutaneous rescue in crises.
After stability and good pain control, the patient was discharged and referred jointly to the Endocrinology and Oncology Outpatient Departments for follow-up.

Physical examination
ECOG 0. Earthy skin colour. Orientation, although with a base of mental retardation. Eupneic at rest. Basal saturation 98%. HR 80 bpm. Cardiac auscultation with pure tones with audible murmur, some extrasystole. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur without rales with generalised hypoventilation. Abdomen soft, depressible, painful on deep palpation in the hypogastrium and left iliac fossa, with non-painful hard hepatomegaly of 2 tracts. No oedema in the lower limbs.

Additional tests
"Chest and abdominal CT scan, reporting findings compatible with neoplasia of the lower lobe of the right lung of about 6.5 cm in diameter, liver metastases and lymphadenopathy at the level of the celiac trunk.
"Liver BAG of metastasis of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour with a proliferative index (Ki 67) of 2% and the following immunohistochemical profile: positive for CKAE1/CK19, chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negative for EMA, TTF-1, CDX2, D2-40, HepPar-1, CK5/6, CK7,CK20, PAS. Doubtful: CD56, CEA.
"5- HIAA in urine positive (26.50 mg/24h).
"Re-evaluation chest-abdomen CT scan, which reports progression in number and size of mesenteric lymph nodes, so a first line of chemotherapy is started with everolimus with good tolerance and no toxicity, to date demonstrating clinical benefit and greater control of the disease.

Diagnosis
Carcinoid syndrome associated with a neuroendocrine tumour of probable intestinal origin with hepatic, pulmonary and abdominal lymph node involvement.

Treatment
A first line of chemotherapy is started with everolimus 10 mg daily on a continuous basis until re-evaluation.

Evolution
One month after discharge from hospital, she visited the Emergency Department on several occasions presenting with central thoracic pain of similar characteristics to the previous admission, requiring treatment with opioids. To improve her clinical condition, the Endocrinology Department was consulted and, after receiving a positive result for 5-HIAA in urine (26.50 mg/24 h), decided to increase the dose of octreotide LAR to 40 mg every 21 days.
At the beginning of February, on an outpatient basis from the Oncology Department, a re-evaluation CT scan of the chest and abdomen was requested, which showed progression in the number and size of mesenteric lymph nodes, so a first line of chemotherapy with everolimus was started with good tolerance and no toxicity to date, demonstrating clinical benefit and greater control of the disease.
