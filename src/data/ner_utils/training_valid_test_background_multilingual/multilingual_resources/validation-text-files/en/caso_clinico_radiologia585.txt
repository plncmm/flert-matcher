We present the case of a 26-month-old girl who came to the emergency department with a high fever of 4 days' evolution and abdominal pain of progressive intensity.

ECHO: thick-walled cystic lesion with heterogeneous content located in the anterior supravesical region. CT scan with EV contrast: cystic lesion of 55 mm maximum craniocaudal diameter, located in the urachus tract between the umbilicus and the bladder dome, adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall. It has thick walls that strongly capture contrast, with intralesional septa, so its appearance is that of an over-infected urachal cyst. Percutaneous drainage of the collection was performed, obtaining purulent fluid, which was sent for microbiological and cytological study. Microbiology: abundant colonies of Staphylococcus aureus. Cytology: negative for malignant cells. Marked acute inflammatory component.
