Clinical history and anamnesis
We present a 17-year-old male with a history of primary hypercoagulability due to heterozygous mutation of the prothrombin gene and the homocysteine gene with an episode of cavernous sinus thrombosis at the age of 6 years, for which he has been anticoagulated with acenocoumarol since then. For the past 10 years, he has presented with almost continuous oral thrush, two episodes of genital ulcers in this period, pruritus and redness of the free edge of both eyelids and liquid stools (3 times a day). Diagnosed with prurigo due to acneiform lesions with residual scarring. In September 2013, he visited the emergency department for skin lesions that began on the inner left thigh and spread distally, ruling out venous thrombosis. In addition, he had intermittent episodes of peripheral arthralgia, asthenia and fever, self-limited, with weight loss of about 3 kg in recent months. The patient was referred from the dermatology department to the internal medicine department on 8 January 2014 to rule out possible Behçet's disease, where general laboratory tests, autoimmunity and immunodeficiency studies and a whole-body CT scan were requested. The patient presented with a hard, firm tumour on the anterolateral side of the neck, with lymphoproliferative syndrome being ruled out as a first possibility. The patient attended the emergency department on 9 January due to a cervical tumour that had been present for 48 hours after a coughing spell and was increasing in size. Examination revealed dysphonia and cervical tumour in the left anterolateral region, two oral aphthous lesions on the tongue and inner face of the lower lip. The rest of the patient had no other findings. Following an urgent cervical ultrasound scan, an image was found compatible with a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior wall of the left common carotid artery (LCCA) measuring 28x28x26 mm, which was confirmed by CT angiography where prominent venous vascular structures were also observed in the left temporal parenchyma, as well as in posterior cervical soft tissues in relation to a possible non-nidal intracranial vascular malformation of the fistula type. Following the results of these imaging tests, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where on day 10 angiography was performed, showing chronic occlusion of the superior longitudinal sinus with great development of venous collateral circulation. Giant pseudoaneurysm (7-8 cm long with a narrow neck of about 8 mm) and severe stenosis of the LMCA in relation to its spontaneous dissection. Two sealing stents were placed plus endoaneurysmal thrombin injection with the result of partial sealing in the subsequent control with Angio-CT. On day 15 the patient was transferred to the Internal Medicine hospital ward.
Complementary tests
Complete blood biochemistry was requested with normal results including ESR, CRP was 77.4 mg/L, haemogram with leukocytosis of 15,410 with neutrophilia of 82.4%, thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone levels were normal. 4%, thyroid hormones and urine elemental normal, iron metabolism with low sideremia and saturation index, autoimmunity study (anti-cytoplasm-specific antibodies MPO, PR3, anti-nuclear, anti-centromere, anti-mitochondria, anti-LKM, anti-smooth muscle) normal. Serology was also requested for Chlamydia, hepatitis B and C virus, Mycoplasma, HIV, CMV, EBV IgM and syphilis, with negative results, EBV IgG positive and EBV IgM negative. Proteinogram with albumin/globulin ratio 0.7, slightly increased alpha, beta and gamma globulins and increased immunoglobulins (Ig G 1944.9 mg/dL, Ig A 581.10 mg/dL) with normal Ig M, elevated complement levels (C3 180.7 mg/dL, C5 22.90 mg/dL) with normal C4, C1q. Tumour markers were normal, except for A.C. 125 antigen of 55.9 U/ml. Genetic study for HLA B51 was negative.
Differential diagnosis
The diagnosis of Behçet's disease is exclusively clinical, there are no laboratory tests, autoantibodies or specific histological findings, so we must exclude other processes that justify the patient's symptoms and require different management. According to the revised classification criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet "s Disease (2006), 3 or more points are required to establish a diagnosis of Behçet "s disease, and the patient presented with oral and genital aphthae and cutaneous, vascular and ocular involvement, scoring 7 points in this classification. We must rule out large vessel vasculitis such as Takayasu's arteritis where there is no venous involvement and in the case of our patient did not meet the criteria, in the case of giant cell arteritis it appears at an advanced age and the ESR must be elevated, lastly Kawasaki disease presents with fever, bilateral conjunctivitis, oral aphthae and cervical lymphadenopathy, it occurs in children and in our case lymphadenopathy was ruled out. In relapsing polychondritis, there is ocular, joint and skin involvement, and vascular involvement may appear in the form of aneurysms; however, our patient did not have chondral involvement. We can think of Hughes-Stovin syndrome due to the history of venous thrombosis, haemoptysis, but the presence of pulmonary aneurysms was ruled out. In the case of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular ruptures occur due to the formation of pseudoaneurysms and visceral perforations, without hyperlaxity of large joints, with thin, translucent skin associated with a prominent venous pattern without alterations in scarring and with frequent ecchymosis. In addition, he usually has a typical facies. The definitive diagnosis is based on heterozygous mutation in the COL3A1 and COL3A2 gene. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), non-erosive arthritis, skin involvement, oral aphthous ulcers, gastrointestinal disorders, thrombosis and vasculitis may be considered. According to the new SLICC (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics) diagnostic criteria, our patient only has oral aphthous ulcers and synovitis, without fulfilling 4 criteria (one of them immunological). Sarcoidosis is associated with anterior uveitis, arthritis, skin changes, hypergammaglobulinaemia, but the venous system is not affected and our patient did not have typical pulmonary involvement.

Clinical judgement and evolution
The patient was diagnosed with Behçet's disease with aphthous orogenital ulcers, anterior ocular involvement without hypopyon, acneiform skin lesions, thrombosis of longitudinal cerebral sinuses, spontaneous dissection of ACCI with pseudoaneurysm, arthralgias and probable digestive involvement. During his stay on the ward, his evolution was favourable, with a fever peak secondary to superficial venous access phlebitis with negative blood cultures. He presented haemoptotic sputum, ruling out pulmonary arteriovenous fistula and pulmonary artery aneurysm by means of a new urgent chest CT angiography, where an image of tenuous infectious or inflammatory bronchiolitis was seen. On 17 January, a new arteriography was performed with PTF stent placement and sealing of the pseudoaneurysm with minimal leakage, confirming spontaneous thrombosis of the same in control echo-Doppler. After starting boluses of 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone in three doses and continuing with 60mg/24h of oral prednisone, the general condition improved and the general symptoms and haemoptotic expectoration disappeared. The steroid cycle was consolidated with the first dose of cyclophosphamide (750 mg intravenous on 20 January) without incident. She completed 5 more sessions of cyclophosphamide on an outpatient basis, and is currently on treatment with azathioprine 50 mg/12h, double antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg and ASA 100mg) and anticoagulation with dabigatran.
