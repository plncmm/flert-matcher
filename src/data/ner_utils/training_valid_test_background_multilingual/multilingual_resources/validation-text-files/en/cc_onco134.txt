Anamnesis
Patient aged 36 years with no drug allergies. Surgical history: resection of a vocal cord polyp, laparoscopic right salpinguectomy for ectopic pregnancy in 2013.

Since 25 weeks of pregnancy, she consulted the emergency department on several occasions for symptoms compatible with urinary tract infection (UTI), requiring a change of antibiotic on four occasions to achieve symptom control. Urine cultures were positive for Escherichia coli.

Delivery was uneventful on 16 August 2014. Six days later the patient consulted for fever and severe abdominal pain. Transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound was requested, showing free intraperitoneal fluid. Bladder catheterisation revealed purulent urine. In view of these findings, it was decided to complete the study with an urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and hospital admission to the Urology Department.

Physical examination
Patient in good general condition. Conscious and oriented. Eupneic at rest. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation without alterations. Abdomen: diffuse tympanism on percussion, with generalised pain on palpation. There were no signs of peritoneal irritation. Renal suction was negative bilaterally. Gynaecological examination was normal, except for pain on palpation in the anterosuperior bladder wall.

Complementary tests
"Urine sediment: negative.
"Vaginal exudate: E. coli producing extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase and Candida glabrata.
"CBC: leukocytosis (27,000 leukocytes/mm3) with 93% neutrophils. The rest was normal.
"Abdominal CT scan: abundant intraperitoneal fluid, mostly in the lower pelvis. Reflex ileus.
Extensive tumour growth of the left bladder wall with contrast enhancement. No adenopathy. No other findings.
"Exploratory laparotomy: abundant free peritoneal fluid secondary to perforation in the posterior aspect of the bladder. Closure of the wall was performed with intraoperative biopsy of the wall.
"Pathological findings of the intraoperative specimen: squamous cell carcinoma.

Diagnosis
In order to reach a complete diagnosis, radical cystectomy with Bricker bypass and hysterectomy were performed at a later stage.
"Pathological diagnosis: mixed histological pattern, with areas of conventional urothelial carcinoma (15%), areas of squamous differentiation (20%) and sarcomatoid areas (65%).
"PET-CT: two liver lesions of 11 and 18 mm with maximum SUV 3.4 and 5.7 respectively.
"The patient is diagnosed with sarcomatoid bladder carcinoma pT3aN0M1.

Treatment
It was decided to start palliative chemotherapy treatment on 9/12/2014 with adriamycin 75 mg/m2 day 1 + ifosfamide 3 g/m2 days 1-3 + MESNA IV days 1-3.

Evolution
After administration of the second cycle, grade 2 febrile neutropenia appeared with UTI due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which required intravenous antibiotic treatment for its resolution.
The re-evaluation PET scan after completing three cycles showed an increase in size and metabolic activity of the liver lesions (50 and 51 mm with SUV max 4.9 and 5.8). In addition, several peritoneal implants infiltrating sigma and adjacent muscles are detected.
Given the progression, on 2/3/2015 he started treatment with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 day 1 + gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 days 1 and 8. He received three cycles, with side effects that made it necessary to reduce the dose by 20% in the second cycle.
She is currently awaiting a new PET-CT scan to evaluate the response.
