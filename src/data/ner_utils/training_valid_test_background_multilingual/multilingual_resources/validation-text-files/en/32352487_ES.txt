A 48-year-old man with a history of hypertension attended the emergency department in March 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Madrid. He reported onset of fever (up to 39°C) several days before admission, along with pleural chest pain and dyspnoea. He noted the sudden appearance of mildly pruritic skin lesions 3 days after the onset of fever. He had not taken any medication during the year prior to this episode.
Physical examination revealed confluent erythematous macules, papules and petechiae in a symmetrical periflexural distribution with involvement of the buttocks, popliteal fossae, anteroproximal thighs and lower abdomen. There was a notable absence of lesions in the crural folds. There were no acral or mucosal lesions.
The exanthema consisted of erythematous macules, papules and petechiae involving the buttocks, popliteal fossae and anterior thighs.
Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs showed ground-glass opacities in both lung fields, consistent with atypical pneumonia. A complete blood count revealed a lymphocyte count of 750/μL (reference interval, 1000-4500/μL) (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), a C-reactive protein value of 1, 7 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/L) (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10) and a D-dimer value of 0.68 μg/mL (reference range, 0-0.5 μg/mL) (to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 5.476). Thrombocyte count and coagulation parameters were normal. Serological tests were negative for HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and parvovirus B19. Results of real-time RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
A 5 mm punch biopsy specimen from the left buttock showed a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with abundant erythrocyte extravasation and focal papillary oedema, together with focal parakeratosis and isolated dyskeratotic cells. No features of thrombotic vasculopathy were observed.
The patient was hospitalised and treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg twice daily) and azithromycin (250 mg/d). The patient continued to receive his regular hypertension medication, telmisartan. The exanthema was treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream 0.05% twice daily and loratadine (10 mg/d). The skin lesions subsided after 5 days. The patient recovered from his respiratory problems and was discharged after 12 days.
