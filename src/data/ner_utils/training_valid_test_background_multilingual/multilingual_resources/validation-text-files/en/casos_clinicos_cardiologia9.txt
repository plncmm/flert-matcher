Evolution
Admitted to ICU on 18/09/2012 with the diagnosis of septic shock of unidentified aetiology, with urinary focus as the most likely, requiring low doses of inotropics and vasopressors.
Five hours later, the patient is haemodynamically stable, and inotropes and vasopressors can be withdrawn. However, disorientation and somnolence persisted, with aphasia and new onset right hemiplegia.
An urgent cranial CT scan was performed.
She was assessed by Neurology, without an invasive intravascular procedure due to a history of lumbar puncture in the previous 24 hours, and antiplatelet therapy with ASA was administered.
Urgent TTE was performed, which revealed a non-dilated LV with severe MI.
On 19/09/2012, in the morning, he presented with a deterioration in the level of consciousness, with clear pupillary asymmetry and decortication posture. OTI and connection to mechanical ventilation and a new cranial CT scan were required.
Despite treatment, neurological deterioration progressed, and she remained intubated with only some trunk reflexes.
There was no fever peak at any time.
In the anamnesis of the relatives, no possible focus of endocarditis was observed.

TEE 19/09/2012
Lowly mobile vegetation and homogeneous density of 15x14 mm, with associated perforated aneurysm on the anterior mitral leaflet.
Severe mitral insufficiency with 2 jets, one originating through the perforation of the aneurysm and directed towards the posterior wall of the left atrium with coanda effect, with another smaller one at the central level. 
Severe tricuspid regurgitation due to prolapse.
Mild degenerative aortic insufficiency.

Cultures
Blood cultures 
Collected on admission.
Positive for Streptococcus mitis.
Sensitive to Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone, Cotrimoxazole.
Resistant to Clindamycin and Erythromycin.

The clinical course progressed to brain death on 21/09/2012, 96 hours after admission to the ICU.
A cervico-thoracic-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was requested, in case he could be considered a donor.
CT body: lesions in the spleen and right kidney compatible with small embolic infarcts.

DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION
INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS ON NATIVE MITRAL VALVE DUE TO STREPTOCOCCUS MITIS.
SEVERE MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY DUE TO PERFORATION AT THE LEVEL OF THE ANTERIOR MITRAL LEAFLET VEGETATION.
SEPTIC SHOCK.
SEPTIC EMBOLISM AT CEREBRAL LEVEL WITH HAEMORRHAGIC TRANSFORMATION AND ENCEPHALIC DEATH.
