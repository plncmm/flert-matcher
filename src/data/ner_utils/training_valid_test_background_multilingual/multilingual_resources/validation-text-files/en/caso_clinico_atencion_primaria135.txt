Reason for consultation
General malaise, generalised pain. Review.

Individual approach (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests).
An 18 year old patient from Guinea Conakry, with no pathological history of interest, recently arrived in Spain on a boat a month and a half ago. He came to the clinic for a check-up after a long journey from his country of origin in precarious conditions. He reported generalised pain and general malaise. In the anamnesis by apparatus and systems, apart from what the patient reported, generalised abdominal pain of several weeks' evolution associated occasionally with self-limited bloody diarrhoea stands out. The vaccination schedule is unknown.

Physical examination:
BP 110/70 sat 98% aa HR 70 BMI 17
Oral cavity: normal.
No palpable lymph nodes in the cervical region.
Cardiorespiratory auscultation: rhythmic tones at a good frequency.
Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or visceromegaly,
Extremities with keloid scars on one leg, no other lesions, no oedema.

The complementary tests requested were:
- Haemogram: iron deficiency anaemia with Hb 11 g/dL, MCV 70, no eosinophilia, no other alterations in the haemogram.
- Ferritin < 6 IST 5%.
- Basic biochemistry, liver profile and acute phase reactant: within normality.
- Serology HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C negative. Hepatitis A virus IgM negative, IgG positive. Anti-HBsAg negative. Anti-HBeAg positive, Anti-HBcAg positive.
- Stool parasites (x3): First negative. Second and third positive for Schistosoma mansoni.
- Mantoux negative. Chest X-ray normal.

Family and community approach
This is a patient with special vulnerability as he is an unaccompanied foreign minor (we know that the age officially stated is not real, but we do not know the real age), who has made a long journey in precarious conditions, being exposed to various pathogens due to poor hygiene in the countries he has travelled through and also to an environment where he may have been in contact with mafias, attacks by "Tuaregs" in the desert (the keloid scars are due to this, according to the patient), etc.
Therefore, this is an individual at risk of suffering from diseases that may be little known in our health care system and, as they are in a precarious situation when they arrive in our country, special attention must be paid, as they are in a period of individual susceptibility and the diseases contracted in the Maghreb and in Sub-Saharan Africa may manifest themselves. The risk of geographical mobility will also make it difficult to monitor the patient.

Clinical judgement (list of problems, referential diagnosis)
- Intestinal schistosomiasis
- Chronic hepatitis B to be ruled out (we do not know if he is HBsAg positive) - BMI 17, thinness.

Action plan
- He was referred to the Infectious Diseases outpatients' department, after direct contact with them to avoid delay, for which reason he was scheduled for an appointment the week after the results of the complementary tests requested were known. There they requested treatment for schistosomiasis, which is praziquantel 40 mg/kg in one dose or divided into two doses. This medication is not available in our country, so the infectious diseases service wrote the prescription and sent it to the Ministry of Health, as it is a foreign medication. The patient was also referred to complete the immunological study for hepatitis B.
- The patient was referred to the infirmary for a complete vaccination, as we are completely unaware of the patient's previous immunisations (prior serology for hepatitis B).
- She was instructed to return to our clinic after assessment by the infectious diseases department for further follow-up.
- I prescribed oral iron.
