A 64-year-old female patient, with no past history, was hospitalised due to recent onset fever, severe asthenia, myalgias and polyarthritis. During hospitalisation, she developed chondritis in the left ear and inflammatory and infiltrative skin plaques on the limbs, evoking Sweet's syndrome and vascular purpura.
Laboratory tests showed a sharp rise in CRP, transaminases and neutrophilia. The infectious work-up showed positive IgM serology for HEV. Acute HEV infection was confirmed by stool PCR.
Immunological tests, including ANCA and cryoglobulinaemia found no specific abnormalities.
Skin biopsies showed neutrophilic dermatosis and vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis. A bone marrow biopsy did not provide grounds for haematological disease. The picture led to a diagnosis of polychondritis with necrotising vasculitis.
Despite a bolus of methylprednisolone and prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day, new skin lesions appeared. Cyclophosphamide (0.7 g/m2) was started, but was insufficient to control the disease with the appearance of new necrotic lesions on the toes and persistent inflammation and leukocytosis. The disease stabilised after a second bolus eight days later. The patient was then treated with a conventional scheme of necrotising vasculitis. Liver function rapidly and definitively normalised. She was successively treated with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and metorexate. Currently, after 3 years of evolution and under 5 mg/day of prednisone, the disease behaves mainly as a digital destructive inflammatory arthropathy. A very limited outbreak of vasculitis was observed. Hepatitis has not reactivated.
We present the case of a syndromic association of aggressive necrotising vasculitis, Sweet's syndrome and chondritis, contemporaneous with a primary HEV infection. In our case, the infection may have been the trigger for the inflammatory disease, which autonomises. HEV can cause chronic infection and cirrhosis in transplanted patients or patients with long-term HIV. The prognosis appears good in patients with inflammatory rheumatism on immunosuppressants.
