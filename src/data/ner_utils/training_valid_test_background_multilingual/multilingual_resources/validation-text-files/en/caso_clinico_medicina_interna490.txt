28-year-old man from Argentina, no known drug allergies, occasional cannabis smoker. No relevant medical history or regular medication.
He consulted the Emergency Department for fever up to 39.5oC, of four weeks of evolution, predominantly at night, associated with odynophagia, cough, rhinitis and headache, as well as loss of 7 kg of weight and profuse night sweats. In the last two weeks, epigastric pain and pasty stools were added, with the appearance of vomiting 48 hours prior to consultation.
He was admitted normotensive, eupneic and febrile. Examination revealed cachexia and skin pallor. He had painful lymphadenopathies of less than 1 cm laterocervical, supraclavicular and bilateral inguinal. Abdominal palpation revealed epigastric pain, without peritoneal irritation, as well as hepatosplenomegaly, with no other relevant findings.
Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein of 9 mg/dL, increased glomerular sedimentation rate (60 mm/h) and ferritin (1477 ng/ml). Leukocytosis of 34,000/mm3 and hypereosinophilia of 23,000/mm3 stood out. He had altered liver profile with cytolysis (ALT/AST 90/40 U/L) and dissociated cholestasis (GGT/FA 304/624 U/L).
Anti-infectious mononucleosis antibodies (Epstein-Barr virus), serology for HIV and hepatotropic viruses were negative.
Chest X-ray showed parahilar thickening, with no other relevant findings. The study continued with abdominal ultrasound, which showed hepatosplenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with a pathological appearance, so a thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed, showing a pulmonary micronodulillar pattern, hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathic involvement of the mediastinum, hepatic hilum, gastrohepatic and retroperitoneal ligament.
Blood cultures taken on the day of admission isolated Cryptococcus neoformans grubii variety. A lumbar puncture was performed with positive antigen for Cryptococcus.
Due to the presence of mediastinal adenopathy, fibrobronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage and EBUS with subcarinal lymph node biopsy, which revealed Cryptococcus-like fungal structures.
With the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent patient (primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders and neoplasms were ruled out), treatment was started with amphotericin B and flucytosine for two weeks. Subsequently, the patient was switched to oral fluconazole until completing one year of treatment, presenting good clinical evolution and a progressive decrease in the eosinophil count.
