70-year-old woman, independent for basic activities of daily living. She is a regular smoker, pack index 65. Personal history of advanced COPD with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and repeated respiratory infections since childhood. She has undergone frequent treatment with steroids, for which reason she has steroid diabetes mellitus and secondary osteoporosis. Five months prior to the current symptoms, he was admitted to the Pneumology Department for exacerbation of his COPD. Sputum isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus was performed. After applying Bulpa's criteria, she was considered to have probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and was treated with Voriconazole. During hospital admission, a deficit of IgG 1 and total IgG was observed. On discharge she required home oxygen therapy and Prednisone 20 mg/24 h was maintained. After three months, she was again admitted to the Neurology Department for tetraparesis, from where she was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Department, where she was diagnosed with CMV polyradiculopathy and colitis. After receiving treatment with Ganciclovir and IV immunoglobulins, she was transferred to a chronic hospital for rehabilitation and progressed favourably. On this occasion, she was referred from that hospital after suddenly presenting dysarthria, bradypsychia, left hemiparesis and deviation of the corner of the mouth to the right. In the days prior to the current admission, she had presented headache with organicity characteristics and cough with greenish expectoration. No thermometric fever.

On arrival at the Emergency Department: afebrile, hypotensive (BP 92/63 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 110 bpm) and tachypneic (RR 24 rpm). Physical examination revealed dysarthria, left facial paralysis of central origin, hemiparesis and left hemihypoaesthesia. Left extensor and right indifferent cutaneous-plantar reflex. Generalised hypophonesis with scattered rhonchi on pulmonary auscultation. He also had lesions compatible with oropharyngeal candidiasis and ulcerated skin lesions on the lower limbs. The rest of the examination showed no findings of interest. Urgent laboratory tests were requested, highlighting leukocytosis (14,600/mm3) with neutrophilia (85.5% PMN), the rest of the blood count was normal. Arterial blood gases with global chronic respiratory insufficiency. Lactate 3.5 mmol/l. CRP 44.7 mg/l. Renal and ion function, transaminases, cholestasis enzymes and coagulation without alterations. The chest X-ray (PA) showed bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral hilar reinforcement (more evident in the right hilar). In view of the neurological focality described, a CT scan of the skull with intravenous contrast was performed, showing four hypodense lesions with hypodense halo (perilesional oedema): right base nuclei (23x19mm), right paraventricular substance (23x16mm) and two in the parieto-occipital area (23x19 and 23x16mm). She was admitted with the diagnosis of brain lesions to be studied, with the possibility of an infectious aetiology, due to the patient's immunosuppression and the two previous admissions described above. Treatment was started with pyrimethamine + sulphadiazine and empirical antibiotherapy was added with Linezolid 600 mg/12h and Ceftriaxone 2 g/12h to cover the most frequent pyogenic aetiology.

Differential diagnosis
The most common intracranial lesion in adults is metastasis (up to 50%), which usually presents as a single lesion, its most common origin being non-small cell lung carcinoma (20% of the time it precedes the finding of the primary tumour). Primary tumours of the central nervous system (CNS), vascular pathology, and inflammatory and granulomatous diseases are other potential causes of brain masses. Brain abscess is a rare cause in the general population (incidence 0.3 to 1.3 cases/100,000 population), but its incidence increases considerably in immunocompromised patients. A predisposing condition can be established in up to 86% of cases, the most frequent being infectious pathology of the otological and naso-sinus area, followed by congenital heart disease or endocarditis (13%), haematological process (13%), immunosuppression (9%), previous pulmonary pathology (8%) and meningitis (6%). Three mechanisms can be distinguished in its aetiopathogenesis:
A) by contiguity from otorhinolaryngological area (50- 60%), they present as single lesions;
B) as haematogenous seeding from a distant septic focus (20-30%), they are usually multiple lesions with distribution in vascular territory; and
C) secondary to head trauma or previous neurosurgery (10%), by direct inoculation.
In the general population, the most frequently isolated microorganisms are Streptococcus spp. (34%) and Enterococcus spp. (14%) in the context of nasosinus and otogenic infections; and Staphylococcus spp. (18%), by direct inoculation after neurosurgery or trauma, septic embolisms from endocarditis or congenital cardiac communications. Fungi, parasites and mycobacteria constitute less than 2 % of cases. The results differ when referring to an immunosuppressed population. In these cases, the occurrence of opportunistic infections increases and reactivation of latent infections becomes more important. The aetiology will depend on the epidemiological characteristics, as well as the type and severity of immunosuppression. In an immunosuppressed patient with multiple brain lesions in the middle cerebral artery territory, we must consider the possibility of multiple brain abscesses in the context of haematogenous dissemination or reactivation of opportunistic microorganisms. In our case, it was accompanied by infectious respiratory symptoms and a bilateral pleural effusion, probably related to the CNS findings.

In the presence of multiple brain abscesses with ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT, it is essential to suspect toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Its reactivation generates severe infections in certain situations of cellular immunosuppression (usually HIV with CD4<100/mm3). Pulmonary involvement is rare, and if it does occur, it usually produces a reticulo-nodular pattern. Bacterial causes include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Nocardia spp. Central nervous system tuberculosis includes three clinical forms: meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma and arachnoiditis. In low-prevalence countries, the most common clinical form is meningitis in the context of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection. The presence of masses ("tuberculomas"), with ring-shaped enhancement in more advanced stages, is almost exclusive to endemic areas. In case of CNS involvement, pulmonary involvement is found in 50% of cases, with apical lesions and the presence of caverns as a consequence of reactivation of latent infection being the most common.

Nocardia spp. can cause CNS involvement, either in isolation (9% of cases) or in the context of disseminated Nocardiosis (32% of cases). In these cases, the most frequent primary and concomitant involvement is pulmonary. Only 2% of cases are accompanied by skin involvement. This dissemination occurs mainly in the presence of certain predisposing factors: solid organ and haematopoietic progenitor transplantation, chronic treatment with glucocorticoids, HIV CD4<100/ul, active neoplasia and diabetes mellitus. Among bacterial causes, Listeria monocytogenes, in the context of meningoencephalitis, can cause brain abscess formation in certain risk groups (elderly, neonates and immunocompromised); however, pulmonary involvement is exceptional. Fungal aetiologies include disseminated aspergillosis. It causes CNS involvement in 10-20%. In the absence of adequate local pulmonary immune control (where neutrophils play an important role), the development of angioinvasion by mature hyphae, haematogenous dissemination and distant seeding is possible. It almost exclusively affects patients with severe neutropenia (<500/mm3 neutrophils) of haematological cause or after chemotherapy treatment. There are other fungal infections capable of concomitant pulmonary and CNS involvement. Due to their low incidence, the epidemiological context and the type of immunosuppression, they are unlikely in the current clinical context. Evolution

After admission, cranial MRI with intravenous contrast with gadolinium (sequences pT1, pT2, FLAIR, DWI, Spectroscopy) was performed. There were masses with ring-shaped uptake and diffusion restriction, surrounded by vasogenic oedema, two in the right occipital lobe (24x23x26mm and 21x17x20mm), one right frontal temporo-parietal (27x24x21mm) very suggestive of pyogenic abscesses. Contrast uptake in the cortex and deep cerebral hemisphere suggestive of subacute infarcts or microabscesses.

In order to rule out cerebral toxoplasmosis, serology for Toxoplasma (IgG and IgM negative), HIV serology, also negative, and lymphocyte subpopulations within normal limits were urgently requested. The presentation of cerebral toxoplasmosis with CD4>100 is exceptional. This, together with negative serology, allows us to rule out this aetiological possibility, so pyrimethamine + sulphadiazine is suspended. Despite the fact that tuberculomas occur almost exclusively in endemic areas, we requested determination of interferon gamma release assays (IGRA), which was negative. The haemogram showed a neutrophil count within the normal range (>1500/mm3). This, together with the absence of other predisposing factors, makes the development of invasive aspergillosis unlikely. Transthoracic echocardiography was requested and reported as normal, and chest CT with intravenous contrast confirmed the presence of multiple loculated bilateral pleural effusions. It was decided to perform a diagnostic thoracentesis, due to its greater accessibility and lower risk than the CNS, for biochemical, cell count and microbiological studies. The pleural fluid obtained showed moderate glucose consumption, a predominance of mononuclear cells and met Light's criteria for exudate. The sample was sent for Gram staining, culture in common media and mycobacteria, as well as PCR for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was reported as negative.

The Gram stain of pleural fluid showed a branched filamentous gram positive suggestive of nocardia. Subsequently, there was growth of N. asteroides in culture. In view of the presence of nocardiosis with pulmonary, central nervous system and probably cutaneous involvement, intravenous antibiotherapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), linezolid 600 mg/12h and imipenem 0.5 g/6 h was started. Subsequently, after confirming with antibiogram that it was multisensitive N. asteroides, imipenem was replaced by high-dose ceftriaxone.

Although initially improving, he subsequently evolved neurologically in a torpid manner, also presenting severe hyponatraemia in the context of SIADH secondary to CNS involvement. He remained with a low level of consciousness until death occurred in the context of multi-organ failure.  

Final diagnosis
Disseminated nocardiosis with pulmonary, central nervous system, and probably cutaneous involvement.
