Clinical history:
At one year of age, having tolerated fish, she reported vomiting and refusal. With each introduction of this food, he presented episodes of diarrhoea and skin and eye reddening.
An allergological study was performed with prick tests and specific IgE, confirming sensitisation to various white and blue fish. Three years after her avoidance and after confirming a decrease in sensitisation in prick and specific IgE tests, a controlled exposure test was carried out with tuna and cod, confirming good tolerance. The patient began to eat fish on a regular basis until 4 months after ingestion, when he reported pharyngeal pruritus and an erythematous, micropapular rash on the face with codfish croquettes, with similar symptoms with tuna, mackerel or salmon, and digestive symptoms were added.
A new allergological study was carried out by means of specific IgE determination, again confirming sensitisation to different white and blue fish.
