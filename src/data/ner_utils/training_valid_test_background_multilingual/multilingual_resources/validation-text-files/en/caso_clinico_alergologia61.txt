A 12-year-old boy, with no previous history of interest, consulted because five minutes after being stung by a vespa velutina on his back, he presented with generalised wheals and cutaneous pruritus, chemosis and conjunctival itching, with no other associated symptoms. He was treated at the Health Centre (Ávila) with intravenous methylprednisolone and dexchlorpheniramine, the symptoms subsided after five minutes. He had previously received 6 stings from common wasps without incident. Frequent contact with beehives (beekeeper grandfather) in Avila.

Results:
Allergological study: determination of specific IgE (InmunoCAP, Thermofisher) against complete extract and recombinant hymenoptera (KU/L): Ves v5: 12.30, Vespula cabro: 2.47; Ves v1, Pol d5 and Api m1: negative. Positive intradermal skin tests with Vespula spp at 0.01 mcg/ml and negative with polistes (Pharmalgen® hymenoptera venom ALK Abelló).

With the diagnosis of allergy to vespa velutina venom, treatment was started with 100% vespula spp specific immunotherapy, in a 4-week grouped schedule. According to the recommendations of the SEAIC Hymenoptera Committee, this is indicated given the high cross-reactivity between Vespula, Dolichovespula and Vespa species.
