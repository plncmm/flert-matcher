Personal history
A 29-year-old woman from Bolivia, department of Santa Cruz, who had been living in Spain for three and a half months, employed as a domestic worker. She had a left coxo-femoral prosthesis and was taking oral contraceptives. She denied contact with animals, toxic habits or any other history of interest.

Present illness
She consulted the Internal Medicine Department of our hospital in December 2007 due to generalised pruritus without skin lesions of years of evolution, weight loss of 5-6 kg in the last two years and the presence of occasional "whistling". She provided a blood test carried out in June 2006 showing absolute eosinophilia (1,300 eosinophils/μL).

Physical examination
The patient was in good general condition, conscious, oriented, well hydrated and perfused, afebrile and eupneic at rest. No peripheral lymph nodes were palpable. Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed no alterations. The abdomen was painless, without masses or organomegaly. There were no dermal lesions. The lower limbs had no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis, with preserved and symmetrical pulses.

Complementary examinations
Laboratory tests showed a high absolute eosinophilia (with values of 1,780 eosinophils/μL in November 2007 and 1,760/μL in December 2007). The rest of the blood count was within normal limits. The peripheral blood smear showed eosinophilia, with no other findings. General biochemistry, thyroid study and urine sediment were normal. The autoantibody test (ANA, anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle) was negative, as was the celiac profile. Total IgE was elevated, 2,000 (normal: 0 -100 IU/L).
The requested serology (hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus; Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Toxoplasma and HIV) was negative. Serum samples were sent to the National Microbiology Centre in Majadahonda (Madrid) for serology, and were negative for Fasciola hepatica, Anisakis and Trypanosoma cruzi. The thoracoabdominal CT scan showed areas of patchy condensation in both lung bases with no evident air bronchogram inside, atelectasis lesion in the right lung, umbilical hernia, left coxo-femoral prosthesis, and bilateral axillary and inguinal adenopathies with an inflammatory-reactive appearance. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal and gastric and duodenal biopsy showed mild chronic gastritis. Stool parasite detection was negative.

Diagnostic tests
Serological determinations of IgG against Strongyloides 2.47 (high positive) and IgG serology against Toxocara 1.22 (positive) were performed.

Clinical judgements
Cryptic eosinophilia. Intestinal strongyloidiasis. Probable mixed infestation by Strongyloides stercoralis and Toxocara.


 Evolution She was treated with albendazole (400 mg vo./12 hours for seven days) and ivermectin (two days), with good tolerance. At the end of treatment, the patient was asymptomatic, with disappearance of pruritus, and the absolute number of eosinophils decreased to 180/μL in the subsequent analytical control.
