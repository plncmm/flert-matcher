Anamnesis
A 57 year old man followed up for a year due to hypoaesthesia in the hands and feet, which had started the previous year. Dyslipidaemia and severe exenolism until 5 years ago. In the anamnesis he denied any family history of interest. The patient consulted for indolent burns on the hands, with distribution hypoaesthesia in fingers 2 and 3 of the right hand and left finger 5, with a subsequent rapidly progressive worsening affecting the hands and lower limbs (MMII) up to the knees in a diffuse manner, following a glove and sock distribution. These symptoms were accompanied by distal motor clumsiness in the hands. He had injured his distal extremities without realising it, and had even had sutures without anaesthesia. He denied symptoms suggestive of dysautonomia, as well as systemic or constitutional symptoms.

Physical examination
Normal systemic examination. There were no dermal or mucosal lesions. There were no joint deformities and no palpable thickening of the nerve trunks. In the initial neurological examination the higher mental functions were preserved. Language was normal. The cranial nerves were not altered. Muscle balance showed a slight paresis (4/5) of the abductor digitorum brevis of the first finger of the right hand and of the first dorsal interosseous of the left hand, without atrophy or fasciculations. Sensory examination showed hypoaesthesia in the upper limbs (MMSS), more marked at the level of the median nerve territory in the right hand and ulnar in the left hand. The MMII were affected up to the knees with distal total anaesthesia. There was no decrease in vibratory sensitivity. There was marked distal anhidrosis, with trophic disorders such as hair loss. Gait was normal, Romberg negative. Osteotendinous reflexes were preserved with indifferent skin-plantar reflex.
A new examination 5 months later revealed a more diffuse distribution of hypoaesthesia at the distal level, as well as a more marked weakness with hypotrophy of the ulnar muscles of the left hand associated with atrophy of the abductor digitorum brevis of the first finger of the right hand. These findings were indicative of multineuritis.

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: normal haemogram, biochemistry and coagulation. Normal HDL and LDL-cholesterol. Normal thyroid function and tumour markers. Autoimmune study with negative ANA, C-ANCA, P-ANCA and anti-Ro. Anti-ganglioside antibodies (anti-GM1 and GQ1b IgG) negative. Negative cryoglobulins. Normal immunoglobulins and proteinogram. Immunoelectrophoresis without gammopathy findings. Normal ACE.
- Serum serology for HIV, HBV, HCV and Borrellia negative.
- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan: normal.
- Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and skull: no notable findings.
- Study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): normal cytochemistry, without albuminocytological dissociation. Cytology, bacterial culture and virus PCR were negative.
- Analysis of alpha-galactosidase A activity normal (Fabry disease negative).
- Electroneurography and serial electromyograms (EMG/ENG):
- Initial findings compatible with sensory-motor neuropathy, mainly of severe demyelinating character although also axonal. Predominance in MMSS, asymmetrical and with great chronodispersion, increased latencies and low conduction velocities, decreased amplitude of motor potentials (CMPA) and almost unavoidable sensory potentials. Electroneurography with median motor potential with large chronodispersion, increased latency and decreased amplitude.
- Change in the pattern of involvement in successive EMG/ENG: disappearance of sensitive potentials (NR). Severe decrease in CMPA amplitudes, persisting a large chronodispersion of responses with elongated distal latencies. Patchy involvement, as some nerves such as the right radial nerve or the left peroneal motor nerve showed normal values, a finding suggestive of multineuritis. EMG with reduced neurogenic pattern.
- Sural biopsy: severe evolved neuropathy with complete loss of all fibres, inflammation and presence of intracellular bacilli with positive Fite staining compatible with lepromatous leprosy. Sural nerve biopsy: numerous Fite-positive bacilli are observed.

Diagnosis
Infectious multineuritis due to Mycobacterium leprae.

Treatment
Specific treatment with rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine was started.

Evolution
Given the initial suspicion of an immune-mediated neuropathy, several courses of IV Ig and oral corticosteroids were tried, without improvement. The clinical course continued to progress, developing ulcerative lesions on the feet.
