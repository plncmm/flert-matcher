65-year-old man whose wife had COVID-19. He presented with a dry cough, anorexia and fever (maximum temperature 38.6°C) of 4 days' duration. On admission, a chest CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia. He had C-reactive protein values of 13.5 mg/L and a white blood cell count of 3.0 × 109 cells/L, with 27.4% lymphocytes. Tests processed by the Beijing Centres for Disease Control confirmed COVID-19. Symptomatic treatment was started and moxifloxacin was administered to prevent superinfection. On day 15 of illness he required invasive ventilation. We changed his antibiotics to vancomycin and imipenem because of possible sepsis and administered intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone to attenuate the general inflammation. On day 16 he had C-reactive protein values of 244.4 mg/L, a leucocyte count of 10.1 × 109 cells/L, with 1.6% lymphocytes, and a lactic acid value of 3.13 mmol/L. On the 21st day of illness he went into septic shock and died.
