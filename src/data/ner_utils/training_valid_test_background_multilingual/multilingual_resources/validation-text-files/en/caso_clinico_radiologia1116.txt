A 59-year-old male patient with a history of Diabetes Mellitus II diagnosed a year ago. He consulted the emergency department of our hospital with a history of progressive general condition in the last 3 months, weight loss and night sweats. The week prior to admission, pain in the flank and left iliac fossa, fever up to 38.5 C and scarce vomiting were added.

Physical examination revealed him to be emaciated, pale, febrile, tachycardic, with a noteworthy algorra in the oral cavity. The diagnoses on admission were: febrile syndrome, abdominal pain under study, consumptive syndrome, immunosuppression, oral candidiasis.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed multiple retroperitoneal adenopathies and at the level of the root of the mesentery, some confluent, hypodense. After the use of contrast, there was peripheral permeation.

Axial CT scan showing retroperitoneal lymph nodes peripherally permeated after injection of contrast medium.

Sagittal and coronal reconstruction CT scan showing hypodense lymph nodes, with peripheral permeation, surrounding the superior mesenteric artery (asterisks).

Subsequently, HIV-associated immunosuppression was confirmed. Puncture of the lymph nodes was performed under CT; a smear test (+) was obtained for tuberculosis (TB). The biopsy showed abundant intracellular bacilli. 

Histological sample obtained by puncture of one of the lymph nodes demonstrating the presence of M. tuberculous.
