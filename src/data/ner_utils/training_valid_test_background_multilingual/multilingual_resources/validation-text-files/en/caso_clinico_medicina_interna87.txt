81-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypoacusis, adenocarcinoma of the sigma operated on laparoscopically 8 months previously (complete resection with free edges), who consulted for two months of intense asthenia, depressed mood, bradypsychia, bradykinesia and progressive difficulty in ambulation. He had also presented with an isolated episode of fever of up to 38oC with no clear focus, which had subsided after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The previous month she had seen a neurologist for the same reason, who diagnosed mild parkinsonism and depressive syndrome, adding sertraline and requesting a brain MRI, which only showed cortico-subcortical atrophy in accordance with age. Three months earlier he had begun to suffer from mechanical low back pain for which he had been assessed by a traumatologist and treated with corticoids, benzodiazepines and morphine derivatives for a month, with subsequent withdrawal of the same, showing spondyloarthrosis, slight lumbar scoliosis and L2-L3 disc impingement in a simple X-ray study. On examination he was in fair general condition in relation to asthenic habitus. He was conscious, oriented and cooperative, although he appeared to have bradypsychia and mild bradykinesia. The neurological examination was normal without focality. His systolic blood pressure was 110 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 55 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation showed rhythmic tones without murmurs, pulmonary auscultation was normal. The abdomen was soft and depressible with no palpable masses or megaliths. The lower extremities showed no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis. No peripheral lymph nodes were palpable. Laboratory tests showed Urea 82 mg/dL (20-50), Creatinine 0.77 mg/dL (0.65-1.35), Fe 48 mcg/dL (50-150), Ferritin 334 ng/mL(20-300), Transferrin 188 mg/dL (200-360), Albumin 2.6 g/dL (3.5-5.2), Total protein 6.2 g/dL (6.3-8. 5), GOT 34 U/L (1-37), GPT 46 U/L (1-41), GGT 73 U/L (1-55), LDH 560 U/L (240- 480), CRP 55.7 mg/L (0-5), Leucocytes 5.11 x10^9/L (4-10.8), Absolute neutrophils 2. 38x10^9/L (2.5-7.5), Red cells 3.59 x10^12/L (3.80-5.85), Haematocrit 31%(33-55), Haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL (12-16), MCV 89 fL (80-99), MCH 31 pg/cell. (27-31), Platelets 46x10^9/L (130-400), ESR 78 mm (1-20), Quick's Index 100% (75-110), PT 10 sec (8- 13.8). Fibrinogen 4.45 g/L (1.55-5.55). Calcium, phosphorus and thyroid hormones in normal range. The peripheral blood smear (FSP) confirms thrombopenia without platelet aggregates and shows evidence of Rouleaux's phenomenon, with no erythroid series findings and normal manual formula, without dysplastic features. The urinary sediment showed proteinuria in the dipstick >300mg/dl and haematuria of 2 cells per field. Given the finding of pancytopenia and elevated inflammatory markers, a new blood test was requested a few days later, confirming anaemia and platelets in similar numbers, but with a normal white series, and the following parameters were also obtained: beta-2-microglobulin: 8. 1 mg/L(0.0-3.0); immunoglobulins: IgG 2097 mg/dL(700-1200), IgA 540 mg/dL (70-400), IgM 152 mg/dL (40-230); proteinogram with immunofixation in serum: Albumin 2. 9 (3.5-5.0), gamma globulins 2.2 g/dL (0.7-1.2), kappa/ lambda ratio normal, conclusion: no monoclonal peaks detected in serum; proteinogram with immunofixation in urine: albuminuria, no monoclonal peaks; proteinuria in urine 0. 70 g/24h; tumour markers (CEA, PSA), folic acid and vitamin B12, reticulocytes and haptoglobin in normal range, and negative serology for HBV, HCV, HIV, brucella (rose bengal) and leishmania. Mantoux test was performed and was also negative. A chest X-ray was also requested, which only showed the already known mild cardiomegaly, and abdominal ultrasound, which was normal (spleen and liver of normal size without lesions, no free fluid or pathological thickening of intestinal loops, no lymphadenopathies). Given the negative results of the complementary tests to date, it was decided to extend the study with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. A cytological study of the aspirate showed a preserved series, no dysplasia, regenerative aspect and 5% plasma cells. Flow cytometry showed no aberrant populations suggestive of haematological pathology, and the anatomopathological study of the biopsy was also normal. At this point, two weeks after the first consultation, the patient started febrile symptoms again. These were intermittent febrile peaks of up to 39oc and predominantly in the evening, with no apparent clinical focality, so it was decided to admit the patient to hospital for further investigation, starting broad-spectrum antibiotherapy with levofloxacin. Given the history of neoplasia and the low back pain, a thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan and a dorsolumbar MRI were also performed to rule out malignancy or hidden infectious focus. The CT scan detects cardiomegaly and prostatic hypertrophy, ruling out adenopathies, nodules or thickening of the digestive tract suggesting neoplasia. The MRI reports spondyloarthrosis changes with disc protrusions at L2-L3 and L5-S1, with no other findings. Analysis on admission showed persistent anaemia and thrombopenia: Hb 10.7g/dL (12-16), platelets 55x10^9/L, significant increase in proteinuria and haematuria (protein in urine 3.26 g/24h and red blood cells in urine 52 cells per field) without renal failure and increase in inflammatory parameters: CRP 93.2 mg/L, ESR 120 mm1oh. In view of febrile syndrome, bicytopenia and glomerulopathy (glomerulonephritis?) the study was extended with autoimmunity: Rheumatoid factor <10 IU/mL (0-14), anti-nuclear antibodies 0.7 ratio (0.0-1.0), anti-dsDNA antibodies 10. 5 IU/mL (0-20), Complement C3 50 mg/dL (90-180), Complement C4 16 mg/dL (10-40), Circulating immunocomplexes 52 mcg/mL (0-55), Anti-cardiolipin IgM Ac 9. 3 MPL U/mL (0-13), anti-cardiolipin IgG 2.0 GPL U/mL (0-20), P-ANCA(MPO) 0.7 U/mL (0-5), C-ANCA(PR3) 23.8 U/mL (0-5), anti-glomerular basement membrane IgG 10.9 IU/mL (0-20). Of note was the decrease in C3 levels and the elevation of C-ANCA. Likewise, in view of the finding of a doubtful systolic heart murmur in the aortic focus in the physical examination during admission, echocardiography was performed, which revealed a 14x10 mm cottony, deflected image in the aortic valve and at the level of the ventricular face of the non-coronary sigmoid valve, which prolapsed into the aorta in systole, highly suggestive of vegetation. Immediately levofloxacin was withdrawn and empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment was started for infective endocarditis with daptomycin 10 mg/kg/day, gentamicin 1mg/kg/8h and ampicillin 2g/4h. Three days after starting this regimen, we were informed of yeast growth in two of the three blood cultures taken on admission, so anidulafungin 200mg/day and fluconazole 200mg/8h were added. Five days later, the yeasts were identified as Candida famata, and grew in 6 of 7 blood cultures taken so far. Antibiotic therapy was then de-escalated by withdrawing daptomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin. Reviewing the culture history, the patient had presented 2 positive blood cultures for the same fungus with the same antibiotic sensitivity profile 8 months earlier, coinciding with hospital admission for laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid neoplasia, during which time he received parenteral nutrition. After 10 days on treatment with anidulafungin and fluconazole, the latter was replaced by voriconazole at a dose of 200mg/12h due to a better sensitivity pattern. After eleven days of this modification and in view of the cholestasis pattern in the blood tests (GGT 347 U/L, FA 729 mU/mL), it was decided to withdraw both and prescribe fluconazole 400mg/ev/12h plus caspofungin 50mg/ev/24h again. Periodic echocardiographies were performed without evidence of local complications of endocarditis, with a slight reduction in the size of the wart in serial studies. There was also progressive improvement in proteinuria during hospitalisation (1.85g/24h 20 days after starting treatment). Surgical treatment of the vegetation was not performed given the comorbidity and the express refusal of the patient and family to undergo invasive procedures. As for distant complications, a few days after admission the patient presented pain in the right forefoot with evidence of cellulitis plaque and pain on palpation of the tarsus compatible with arthritis, with no alterations in the plain X-ray. On the other hand, and after 25 days of targeted treatment, the patient presented with intermittent claudication in the lower limbs, predominantly on the right. Arterial echo-Doppler was performed with findings suggestive of stenosis >50% in the left popliteal artery, obstruction of the right external iliac artery with preocclusion of the right popliteal and pedia artery. The patient is currently on oral fluconazole with good clinical evolution with no new febrile peaks and negative serial blood cultures. He has required stenting due to his arterial pathology without being able to rule out that this is a complication of the infectious condition.
