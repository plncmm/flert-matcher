A 64-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with fever and dry cough, treated with antibiotics for the previous 10 days. A bedside ultrasound revealed diffuse B-lines with bibasal consolidations, also documented by chest X-ray. A nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient's medical history was unremarkable and he was not taking any medication. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) was detected on ECG. He was treated with darunavir/cobicistat, hydroxychloroquine and LMWH at a preventive dose and low-flow oxygen therapy with nasal goggles. He was discharged after 10 days, in good health and not requiring oxygen. His CIS score was below 4, so LMWH was discontinued. However, one week later the patient again presented to our emergency department with acute chest pain on breathing (SpO2 97%, PaO2/FiO2 341 mmHg on room air) and left leg pain of 3 days' evolution. He stated that he had no history of venous thrombosis and no family history of thrombophilia. Clinical suspicion of DVT was confirmed by a compressive ultrasound with no compressibility of the left popliteal vein. The echocardiogram was normal. A lung ultrasound showed focal B lines and left basal consolidation with mild pleural effusion. ECG findings were unchanged (RSN, BRDHH). A CT pulmonary angiography revealed left subsegmental pleural effusion with diffuse ground glass opacities and cobblestone pattern (CT visual index 5%). Another nasopharyngeal swab was obtained with a low positive result. High-dose fondaparinux was started immediately and after 5 days he was switched to a twice-daily dabigatran regimen. The patient was discharged without sequelae on day 6.
