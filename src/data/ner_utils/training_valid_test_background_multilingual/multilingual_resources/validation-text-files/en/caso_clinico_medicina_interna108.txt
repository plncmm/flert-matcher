A 56-year-old patient with a history of HIV and HCV infection (genotype 3a), currently on treatment with tenofovir/emtricitabine and nevirapine, with good virological and immunological control (undetectable CV and CD4 795 copies). He had poor tolerance to treatment with interferon and rivabirin. The last Fibroscan was compatible with stage F1 (6.3). He was admitted for skin symptoms consisting of erythematous, macular and poorly demarcated lesions of several days' evolution, predominantly distal on the extremities (photo). Analysis showed 13,240 leukocytes with 845 neutrophils. CRP 2.02 mg/dl. An autoimmune study was requested: ANCA 1/40 (p-ANCA) and ANA 1/320 (homogeneous pattern) with normal complement C3, C4 and CH50, negative cryoglobulins and RF. HIV CV was undetectable and HCV CV was 701188 IU/ml. Skin biopsy results are compatible with chronic perivascular lichenoid dermatitis with subepidermal vesiculation with neutrophils and vasculitic damage with focal leukocytoclasia. The whole clinical picture is suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, so it was decided to start treatment with sofosbuvir and daclastavir, with a favourable evolution and disappearance of the lesions.
