A 66-year-old male, hypertensive and type 2 diabetic on insulin therapy. He was admitted to Internal Medicine in 2006 with the diagnoses of calculous cholecystitis, community pneumonia and septic shock due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and again in 2007 for community pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae.
She consulted the emergency department for pain and decreased visual acuity in the right eye and fever. The fever was related to a case of influenza, a diagnosis of uveitis was made and discharge was decided. Subsequently, the eye discomfort worsened, the fever increased and the headache was associated with headache that did not subside with the usual analgesia. She attended the emergency department 48 hours later and endophthalmitis was diagnosed in the affected eye.
The blood test showed: GOT 56 IU/l, GPT 232 IU/l and GGT 160 IU/l. Chest X-ray was normal. Lumbar puncture: 1555 cells/microL (82% neutrophils) with glucose consumption compatible with acute bacterial meningitis. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started with Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin and Vancomycin. In view of the suspicion of septic emboli, an echocardiogram was performed (normal) and an abdominal ultrasound (12 mm hypoechoic lesion compatible with abscess). CSF, blood and urine cultures isolated multisensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite adjusting antibiotics according to the antibiogram, the clinical evolution was poor and after a few days, the patient required admission to the ICU. Multiple brain, lung and liver abscesses were demonstrated by imaging techniques. He required evisceration of the right eye with renewed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae in ocular samples. Given the possibility of a highly virulent strain, a sample was sent to the reference microbiology laboratory and Klebsiella pneumoniae serotype K1 was found.
Finally, after several adjustments of the antibiotic therapy, the evolution was satisfactory and the patient was discharged home after three months of hospitalisation.
Serotype K1 is a highly virulent pathogen that typically colonises in the liver, often leading to catastrophic septic complications in the eye and central nervous system. Although it is relatively common in Asia (especially in diabetic patients), it is an exceptional germ in Europe, of which there are very few cases described in Spain.
