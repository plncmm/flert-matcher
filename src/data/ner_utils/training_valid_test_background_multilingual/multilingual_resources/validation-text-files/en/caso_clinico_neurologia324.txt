Anamnesis
A 35-year-old Asian woman attended the Emergency Department for an episode of loss of consciousness and generalised tonic-clonic movements with onset during sleep, associated with salivation and tongue biting, without sphincter relaxation or oculocephalic deviation, with a subsequent post-critical period lasting about 20 minutes, and intense constant frontal headache of progressive onset, without associated fever. Among the personal history, there were no cerebrovascular risk factors, but there was an episode similar to the current one, self-limited in China 15 years ago, not studied, without taking medication, and she had been asymptomatic since then. She had been living in Spain for 3 months. She worked in a shoe factory and as a waitress. There was no family history of neurological interest. She did not report any intake of toxins, drugs or herbs.

Physical examination
Conscious and oriented in all three spheres. Well hydrated and nourished. Temperature 36.6 oC, blood pressure 136/90 mmHg, heart rate 77 bpm. Good distal perfusion. Eupneic. Absence of cutaneous and mucosal lesions. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive to light, no signs of meningismus. Fundus without alterations. Cranial nerves without alterations. Strength and sensitivity in all its modalities symmetrically preserved in all four extremities. Symmetrical and normoactive myotatic reflexes, with bilateral flexor flexor-plantar cutaneous reflex. Coordination, posture and gait within the normal range.

Complementary tests
- General biochemistry, haemogram, coagulation, urine sediment, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were performed without alterations.
- Electroencephalogram was normal.
- Lumbar puncture: opening pressure 10 cm H2O. Crystalline fluid, no blockages. Cytobiochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid without alterations.
- Microbiology: syphilis, HIV, hepatitis C and B virus serology (Hbs, HBcAbs, HBcAbs positive). Positive Giardia cysts in stool. Negative stool culture. Serology: hydatidosis, cysticercosis, toxoplasmosis, Strongyloides stercolaris, negative. Mantoux 15 mm. Sputum BAAR negative.
- Cranial computed tomography (CT) (without contrast): a hyperdense image (16 x 11 mm) in the left parietooccipital cortex, with punctate images of greater density suggestive of calcium. There are three other hyperdense punctate images, one in the white matter of the left semioval centre, one in the right cerebellar hemisphere and the last one in the cortex of the right occipital lobe.
- Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (without contrast): a heterogeneous lesion (25 x 15 mm) is identified in the left parietal region. In T2 sequences it shows a characteristic hyperintense centre and a very hypointense peripheral ring. In gradient-echo sequences it shows significant magnetic susceptibility. Around the lesion there is a faint hypointense area, indicating haemosiderin deposition due to previous bleeding. Associated with the lesion there is a smaller venous angioma. In addition, there are other smaller lesions in the left periventricular region, right parasagittal occipital region, the superior margin of the right cerebellar hemisphere, the left middle cerebellar peduncle, left retroinsular and adjacent to the inferior vermis.

Diagnosis
- Symptomatic epilepsy in association with multiple cavernomatosis.
- Other diagnoses: asymptomatic intestinal giardiasis.

Treatment and evolution
Treatment was started with paracetamol and levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours, with good tolerance and response, and the patient remained asymptomatic without recurrence of new seizures. Eradication treatment with metronidazole against coexisting asymptomatic intestinal giardiasis was also performed. A genetic study was proposed, as well as follow-up of her descendants, pending evaluation in consultations after hospital discharge.
