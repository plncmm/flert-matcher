We present a 65-year-old male patient with no known drug allergies or toxic habits. His personal history included: right pulmonary bronchiectasis; carrier of the prothrombin 20210A mutation and protein S deficiency; deep vein thrombosis and thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs; subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to anticoagulant treatment and haemolytic anaemia.
He had been diagnosed with chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL) in January 2010, receiving the following lines of treatment: 1st line with chlorambucil; 2nd line (April 2010) according to rituximab/fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (RFC) protocol; 3rd line (March 2013) with chlorambucil/ rituximab; 4th line (February 2014) according to rituximab/cyclophosphamide/adriamycin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) protocol; 5th line (February 2015) with RFC; and 6th line (September 2016) with ibrutinib, upon detection of the 17p deletion.
Complications during the chemotherapy cycles include numerous admissions for respiratory infections. Last admission for right basal pneumonia two months earlier. She was admitted to the emergency department in December 2016 for a fever of 48 hours, cough with greenish expectoration and general malaise that had not improved after oral treatment at home with cefuroxime.
On arrival, general condition was acceptable, oxygen saturation 99%, breathing ambient air. Ta 38.2o C. HR: 100 bpm. BP 120/60 mmHg. Cardiopulmonary auscultation normal, without added pathological noises; abdomen without findings. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. As for the complementary tests, the haemoglobin count was 7.7 g/dL, neutrophils 0.48x109/L, lymphocytes 93.0x109/L and platelets 88x109/L. Biochemistry with a CRP of 142 mg/L, the rest of the analytical parameters being normal, and a chest X-ray with an ill-defined left basal condensation.
After admission, blood and urine cultures were performed, as well as urine antigenuria for Legionella spp and pneumococcus, which were negative, and empirical antibiotherapy was started with meropenem (1 g/8 hours iv) and levofloxacin (500 mg/12hours iv). Given the persistence of fever and respiratory symptoms after 48 hours of intravenous treatment, it was decided to add teicoplanin (400 mg/12 hours iv 3 doses, followed by 400 mg/24 hours) and cotrimoxazole (160/800 mg iv every 8 hours). After 7 days of combined antibiotic therapy, he continued with a similar clinical condition. Chest CT scan and fibrobronchoscopy were requested, and liposomal amphotericin B iv (3 mg/kg) was added to the treatment. CT scan showed progression of the lymph nodes secondary to CLL and bilateral pseudonodular lung consolidations, with new-onset cottony and ground-glass margins. Galactomannan antigen in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood was positive (2.2 U/ml and 4.5 U/ml, respectively). After 72 hours of amphotericin treatment, the patient was afebrile and had a good clinical course.
On the seventh day of amphotericin, several nodular lesions with a necrotic centre of about 2 cm in diameter were discovered on the forearm, and a skin biopsy was performed on one of the lesions. Intravenous treatment with amphotericin was maintained for 10 days and subsequently changed to oral voriconazole (200 mg/12 hours). In view of the clinical improvement, the patient was discharged with this drug while awaiting the result of the biopsy.

Differential diagnosis
For the differential diagnosis, we must assess the most frequent processes in immunosuppressed patients with fever, respiratory symptoms with pulmonary infiltrates and nodular skin lesions. Pharmacological toxicity: In our case, ibrutinib can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD), characterised by progressive dyspnoea and non-productive cough. The radiograph is characterised by a bilateral reticular or reticulonodular pattern, with normal radiographs in 10% of cases. Skin lesions are rare. It may produce erythematous lesions in the form of small pink plaques on the trunk. It does not produce nodular lesions. Neither the respiratory nor the cutaneous pattern is consistent with our clinical case.
Infiltration by CLL: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can cause pulmonary involvement as well as cutaneous involvement due to dissemination of the disease. Pulmonary involvement produces bilateral interstitial infiltrates and pleural effusion. Skin lesions due to infiltration are usually single or multiple nodular, erythematous and purpuric lesions. Ulcerated, necrotic or blistering lesions are very rare. Our patient had increased lymphadenopathy compatible with progression of CLL, but the pulmonary infiltrates were not interstitial in pattern and the skin lesions were necrotic.
Bacterial respiratory infection: Infectious processes are the most frequent cause of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with CLL. The chest radiograph is characterised by peripheral airspace consolidation with a non-segmental distribution and the presence of air bronchogram. This could initially be consistent with the abnormalities described in our patient, with the exception of the air bronchogram, characteristic of this type of infection, which was not present. Furthermore, skin lesions are not characteristic except in the case of septic emboli. Septic emboli are round pustular lesions on an erythematous base with a small purpuric centre. They do not usually manifest as nodular skin lesions and appear in greater numbers and are smaller than those described in our clinical case. Candida spp. infection: can produce single or multiple macronodular skin lesions, and sometimes erythema gangrenosum-like lesions, but Candida lung disease is very rare, even in the presence of immunosuppression. Invasive filamentous fungal infections:
1. Scedosporium spp is a filamentous fungus that causes invasive fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients. Unlike Aspergillus spp, it is resistant to amphotericin B. It can produce lung consolidations and skin lesions similar to those produced by Aspergillus spp. It should be considered in patients who do not respond to amphotericin B at high doses. Hence the above mentioned importance of performing LBA for microbiological isolation and antifungigram. The improvement with amphotericin in our patient rules it out.
2. Fusarium spp causes disseminated pulmonary infection with pulmonary nodules and nodular skin lesions with a necrotic or erythematous centre. Nail involvement by this fungus is also characteristic (not present in our patient). It is sensitive to voriconazole and posaconazole. Given the pulmonary and cutaneous involvement described, this aetiology cannot be ruled out in our patient.
3. Zygomycetes. They mainly cause sinusitis and pulmonary infections. Skin lesions are infrequent and usually appear in a primary form and not as a result of haematological dissemination after respiratory disease, so it would be an unlikely aetiology in our patient. 
4. Phaeohyphomycosis. It can cause disseminated infections with very frequent involvement of the central nervous system in immunosuppressed patients, with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement. The lack of neurological involvement in our patient argues against this diagnosis.
5. Invasive aspergillosis. This would be the most likely diagnosis. In a neutropenic patient with fever, respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates with no response to antibacterials, this possibility should always be considered. The positivity of galactamonan in blood and LBA in our patient practically confirms the diagnosis. Although Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent species, Aspergillus flavus more frequently causes cutaneous involvement in the context of dissemination. The lesions, like those in our case, are usually nodular, although they may ulcerate.

Evolution
The patient was readmitted nine days after discharge due to worsening respiratory symptoms. New skin lesions had appeared, three on the arm and two on the leg. Increased blood galactomannan levels were detected (4.68 U/ml). Suspecting treatment failure with voriconazole, treatment was changed to liposomal amphotericin B. Sputum culture detected an increase in galactomannan levels in the blood (4.68 U/mL). Sputum culture detected the presence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, sensitive to tigecycline, which was considered as colonising flora. A fine needle aspiration was performed for microbiology of one of the nodular lesions.
The result of the skin biopsy showed the presence of multiple fungal structures staining with PAS and Groccot, and culture of the puncture specimen showed the presence of Aspergillus flavus. Since it is not uncommon for this microorganism to be resistant to amphotericin, treatment was changed to iv caspofungin plus voriconazole (6 mg/kg/12 hours iv), while awaiting antifungigram. This confirmed sensitivity to voriconazole, so after a slow clinical-radiological improvement, the patient was discharged with voriconazole monotherapy.
After 20 days at home, he was readmitted again due to recurrence of fever and respiratory symptoms. He remained neutropenic and the galactomannan level had been decreasing in previous controls. Empirical treatment was started with iv meropenem, maintaining voriconazole. HRCT showed the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
The patient worsened, with the appearance of respiratory failure, and fever persisted. Thrush and odynophagia appeared, and on the sixth day of admission, caspofungin was added to the treatment, changing meropenem for tigecycline plus levofloxacin. Despite this, he continued to progressively worsen clinically and died on the ninth day of admission. On that day he reported positive blood cultures for multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii sensitive to tigecycline and colistin.

Final diagnosis
- Disseminated aspergillosis due to Aspergillus flavus, with pulmonary and cutaneous involvement.
- Bacteraemia due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
