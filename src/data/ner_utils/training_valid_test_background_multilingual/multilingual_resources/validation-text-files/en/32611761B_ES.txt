A 49-year-old man, otherwise healthy, with fever, myalgia and dry cough of 1 week's evolution. A few hours after admission, he presented with difficulty in naming objects, spatial-temporal disorientation, confusion and restlessness. A chest CT scan showed bilateral peripheral opacities, indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia. Cranial CT and MRI scans obtained two days later were irrelevant. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and proteinorrachia. Empirical treatment with acyclovir, ampicillin and ceftriaxone was started and discontinued as soon as CSF cultures and PCR were negative. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in nasopharyngeal swab but negative in CSF. Three days later, the patient was back to normal, except for amnesia of the previous days.
