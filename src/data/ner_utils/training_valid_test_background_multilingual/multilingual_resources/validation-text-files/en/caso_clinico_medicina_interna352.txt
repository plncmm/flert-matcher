Personal History
We present the case of a 70-year-old man with IgG autoimmune haemolytic anaemia treated with steroids (he developed corticodependence and underwent splenectomy), in addition to several admissions for febrile syndrome attributed to chronic active Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection.

Present illness
He was referred from another centre for fever, tachyarrhythmia, thrombopenia and impaired renal function. Suspecting severe sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started, after taking cultures.

Physical examination
Initially BP 107/53 mmHg, HR 84 bpm, Ta 38.6 oC, FR 16 rpm, O2 saturation 99% (supplemental oxygen at 3 bpm) and mucocutaneous pallor, with no other findings.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests showed macrocytosis, elevated bilirubin at the expense of indirect bilirubin and normal LDH. Serology was performed, with positive results for EBV IgM and viral load of 2700 copies, and the rest was anodyne.

Clinical evolution
On the seventh day of admission, the on-call medical team assessed the patient for pain on mobilisation of the lower limbs. Examination revealed minimal bilateral paresis (probably caused by pain), without oedema or erythema. The symptoms subsided with the administration of paracetamol. On re-evaluation, he was tachypnoeic and markedly diaphoretic. At that time, significant anaemia was observed, with increased thrombopenia (reaching 6000/ Î¼L) and impaired renal function. A cranial CT scan was requested (no findings) and an intra-abdominal CT scan with contrast (discrete free perihepatic and rectovesical cul-de-sac fluid, bilateral pleural effusion and oedema of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, without active bleeding). The haematology department was contacted (indicated transfusion support) and Intensive Care Medicine (initially did not require advanced organ support). After performing a differential diagnosis and given the high suspicion of haemophagocytic syndrome triggered after active EBV infection, blood tests were requested, highlighting hyperferritinaemia (post-transfusion) and hypertriglyceridaemia, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing evidence of haemophagocytosis. As the patient met 5 out of 8 criteria for this entity and presented clinical worsening (requiring transfer to the ICU with the start of haemodialysis), treatment was started with etoposide, dexamethasone and cyclosporine, with clinical improvement and a decrease in EBV copies (400). The patient was discharged from hospital with adequate ambulation. He is currently undergoing successive check-ups at outpatient clinics.
