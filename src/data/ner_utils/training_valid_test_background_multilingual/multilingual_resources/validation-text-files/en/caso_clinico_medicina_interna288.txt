40-year-old patient with a personal history of treated and cured HCV and Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. Onset of epistaxis at 10 years of age and at 20 years of age appearance of facial telangiectasias. In 2007, following a picture of bilateral left hemianopsia, headache, fever and vomiting, the patient was diagnosed with right occipital brain abscess, which was operated on, with positive cultures for Peptostreptococcus spp. Embolisation of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in 2009 and 2011. Follow-up in outpatient internal medicine department. Paternal grandfather, mother and sister affected by the disease.
He came to the emergency department for a tonic seizure with associated loss of consciousness and generalised rigidity. On regaining consciousness, he was stuporous and presented with right hemibody paresis, which had partially recovered on arrival. He reported fever of up to 38.5oC with headache and bradypsychia for the previous 48 hours. On neurological examination the patient was conscious and oriented, bradypsychic, with dyslexia and dysgraphia, without motor focality. During the examination, he suddenly presented tonic rigidity in the right lower limb with extensor cutaneous-plantar reflex.
A cranial CT scan showed a hypodense image with perilesional oedema without a clear underlying lesion in the left frontal region.
Empirical antibiotic treatment was started with Ceftriaxone, Metronidazole and Vancomycin, as well as Levetiracetam as secondary prophylaxis for seizures and Dexamethasone to treat cerebral oedema. He was initially admitted to the intensive care unit and later transferred to the infectious diseases unit of the internal medicine department.
Brain MRI was performed to better characterise the brain lesion and reported a focal lesion in the left frontal convexity measuring 33x32x19mm, well-defined with a hyperintense centre in T2 and a hypointense halo and abundant associated vasogenic oedema, suggestive of brain abscess. The neurosurgery department assessed the patient and decided to perform surgery, which was carried out without incident and after which the patient progressed favourably on the ward.
A chest CT scan during admission revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas that were to be embolised on discharge, once the patient's postoperative period was over.
