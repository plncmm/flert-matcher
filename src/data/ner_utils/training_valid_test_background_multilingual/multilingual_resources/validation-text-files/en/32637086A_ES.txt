A 46-year-old man with a mild cough and fever of 4 days' duration. He had a history of hypertension and contact with suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical examination and vital signs were normal, except for febrile fever (temperature: 38.2 C).
Chest X-ray was normal. Haematological tests showed lymphocytopenia and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (58). An RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; serum ferritin was 746 ng/ml. The patient was admitted to the coronavirus isolation unit. He was given hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg daily). The patient's condition worsened and on the second day he presented dyspnoea (respiratory rate: 35 r.p.m.), oxygen saturation was 80% and temperature, 39.5C, arterial blood gas on room air gave PaCO2: 23mmHg, PaO2: 57mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 114 mmHg. Chest X-ray showed ground-glass opacities in the upper right area, with a small area of consolidation. A CT scan showed small subpleural ground-glass opacities involving both lower lobes and the right upper lobe. The patient was given non-invasive oxygen therapy and was administered a vial of meronepem (1 g three times a day), hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice a day) and Kaletra tablets (lopinavir/ritonavir, 800/200 twice a day), as well as enoxaparin (4000 IU each day). After 3 days, the patient did not respond to the treatment regimen and worsened further. Dyspnoea increased (oxygen saturation 60% without O2 to 90% with 10 L O2 with nasal cannula), bilateral diffuse subcrepitant, temperature was 39.5 C and arterial blood gas at 10 L O2 with nasal cannula gave PaCO2: 33mmHg, PaO2: 58mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 96mmHg, serum ferritin: 1074ng/ml, ESR: 91, D-dimer: 1140ng/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP): 37mg/dL, with normal troponin. A CT scan showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and several areas of consolidation in different regions of the whole lung. Despite treatment, the patient received 200ml of convalescent serum from a recovered moderate COVID-19 patient, after necessary testing of the donor plasma (haemoglobinaemia and viral testing). The patient started to improve clinically; 4 days later he was quite stable, with no dyspnoea, oxygen saturation in room air reached 95% and chest X-ray showed partial resolution of the lesions. The patient was discharged from the hospital 16 days after admission, in good health and without symptoms; chest examination was normal, chest X-ray yielded no relevant radiological findings and three consecutive RT-PCR tests, spaced a minimum of 24 hours apart, were negative.
