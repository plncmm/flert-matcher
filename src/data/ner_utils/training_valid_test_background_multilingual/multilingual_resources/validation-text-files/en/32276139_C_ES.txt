44-year-old woman from Yiyang. She had had close contact with her older sister. On 13 February she developed fever (37.8°C) and poor appetite. Three days later she was taken to hospital. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 2.88 x 10^9/L, C-reactive protein of 17.06 mg/L, and fibrinogen of 4.27 g/L. Tests for influenza A and B were negative. A chest CT scan showed several high-density patchy shadows in both lungs. On 17 and 20 February, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. After treatment, the symptoms disappeared. Consequently, she was discharged on 21 February and kept under home quarantine. As her father had been diagnosed with COVID-19 on 28 February, she was again admitted to the hospital for further testing. This time, tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and specific IgG and IgM antibodies were positive. The ESR was 55.6 mm/h. Antiviral therapy with interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir was administered. On 2 March, a new viral nucleic acid test was also positive. The nasopharyngeal swab was negative twice, on 4 and 6 March, with concurrent improvement of the lung CT scan.
