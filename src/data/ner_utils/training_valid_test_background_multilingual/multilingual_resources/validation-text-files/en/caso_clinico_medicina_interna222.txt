Male patient, 73 years old, AHT, COPD type pulmonary emphysema, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on treatment with synthrom, thrombocytopenia and polycythaemia being monitored by haematology and multiple small infarctions in the left hemisphere.
She consulted Internal Medicine for 2 years with haemorrhagic macules on both legs and ecchymosis on the 2nd and 3rd toes of the MID. A biopsy of one of the macular lesions was performed, with histological results of mild acro-angiodermatitis. A new biopsy of the ecchymotic lesion was requested, this time with the result of Kaposi's sarcoma classic variant with positive immunostaining for Human Herpes Virus type 8 (HHV8). HIV, HCV, HBV and syphilis: negative. HHV8 serology: positive 1/640. Doppler echocardiography MMII: absence of deep vein thrombosis. Chest and abdominal CT scan: signs of chronic bronchopathy, the rest normal.
Dermatology was consulted, who started treatment with Difenciprone with partial response, without disappearance of the skin lesions. Given the lack of response, it was decided to refer to Oncology, who started treatment with liposomal Doxorubicin, with significant improvement in the lesions, although without complete disappearance of the lesions.
Kaposi's sarcoma is a multifocal systemic disease, with predominantly cutaneous involvement, consisting of a proliferation of endothelial cells and related to HHV8 infection.
Classic Kaposi's sarcoma is a slow-course, benign variant that appears in adults in their 60s as single or multiple, soft, bluish-red macules or papules, preferentially on the lower extremities, which spread centripetally and progress to plaques, nodules or tumours. Irrespective of the clinical stage, intranuclear expression of HHV8 is detected.
The macular lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma must be differentiated from microvenular haemangioma, benign lymphangiomatosis and well-differentiated angiosarcoma. In advanced stages, differentiate from acroangiodermatitis, Kaposi's pseudosarcoma and erythema elevatum diutinum.
Complete resolution is practically impossible, given the high risk of recurrence. In immunocompetent patients with classic Kaposi's sarcoma, watchful waiting is an accepted option. Surgical excision is reserved for single, accessible lesions. In multiple but relatively localised lesions, radiotherapy is used, and in rapidly progressive forms or those with systemic involvement, chemotherapy is used.
