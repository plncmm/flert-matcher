Anamnesis
This is a 62-year-old male, with no known drug allergies, an ex-smoker since December 2015, with a cumulative total consumption of 80 pack-years and moderate enolic consumption until 2012. He had worked as a welder. He lives at home with his wife and has 3 children who provide him with good family support. His family history includes a sister who died of colon neoplasia. He has a pathological history of hypercholesterolemia in pharmacological treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in treatment with inhaled tiotropium 18 mcg/day.
His oncological history began in June 2016, when he consulted for right rib pain and moderate exertional dyspnoea of one week's duration.

Physical examination
During the physical examination, he had right costal pain with pleuritic features, without palpable peripheral adenopathies. Respiratory auscultation showed hypophonesis in the right pulmonary apex. The rest of the physical examination by apparatus was unremarkable.

Complementary tests
A chest X-ray was performed showing a right upper lobe (RUL) occupational image with mediastinal widening. The patient was referred to the Rapid Diagnostic Unit for Lung Cancer (UDRCP) and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed an 80 mm lung mass occupying the entire LSD and accompanied by an extensive mediastinal suprahilar homolateral adenopathic mediastinal mass compressing the superior vena cava (SVC), which was permeable. A 9 mm high right paraesophageal lymph node and a 31 mm right adrenal mass were also observed. A fine needle puncture of the lung mass was performed, the pathological result of which was a malignant tumour with spindle cells compatible with sarcomatoid carcinoma. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was also performed, showing the lung mass in hypermetabolic LSD with dubious infiltration of the mediastinal fat adjacent to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, as well as gluteal muscle metastases and polytopic bone metastases.

Diagnosis
Under the diagnostic orientation of neoplasia of pulmonary origin of sarcomatoid characteristics with bone, muscle and adrenal metastases, molecular markers were requested on the initial biopsy, the genetic material being insufficient for the study of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), K-RAS (kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene), ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) and MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor).

Treatment
Pending a new biopsy, first-line treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was started, considering that gemcitabine treatment could be effective in sarcomatoid tumours. She presented regular tolerance to the treatment during the first cycle, with grade 1 mucositis, an episode of fever without focality and grade 3 neutropenia, so the start of the second cycle was postponed. This clinical condition also made it necessary to delay the planned surgical biopsy. In the re-evaluation thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT scan after two cycles, a decrease in the size of the mass in the LSD (from 80 mm to 56 mm) and an increase in the size of the right adrenal lesion (from 31 mm to 54 mm) were observed.
In October 2016, the Plastic Surgery Team performed a new biopsy with exeresis of the pyramidal muscle, with no evidence of malignancy, so a CT/PET scan was performed to plan the biopsy more cost-effectively. Finally, a CT-guided biopsy of the right paramediastinal lesion was performed, with the diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) suggestive of adenocarcinoma (TTF1 and p63 negative), with negative molecular study for ROS1, MET, ALK, KRAS and EGFR.
With this result, it was reoriented as a probable stage IV NSCLC due to bone and adrenal involvement with total response of the bone involvement, partial response of the lung lesion and stability of the adrenal lesion after 2 cycles of treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Given the delay in obtaining the diagnosis and the need to postpone treatment due to toxicity or diagnostic procedures, it was decided to terminate the first line of treatment and to carry out controls with evaluation of the disease.

Evolution
During the follow-up period, the patient came to the emergency department with an increase in cough with self-limited haemoptotic expectoration. He also explained the appearance of right supraclavicular adenopathy. In the re-evaluation CT scan 4 months after the end of the first line of treatment, progression of the disease was observed at the lymph node level (appearance of a 53 x 34 mm laterocervical and right subclavicular adenopathic mass), pulmonary (increase of the paramediastinal lesion in LSD from 45 x 3 1 mm to 58 x 37 mm) and adrenal (increase in size from 54 mm to 86 mm) and the appearance of a nodule in the right pararenal space suggestive of a new tumour implant. Clinically, the very voluminous right laterocervical/subclavicular adenopathic mass of about 8 cm was observed and palpated on physical examination.
At that time, it was decided to start a second line of treatment with nivolumab. PDL-1 determination was requested in the tumour biopsy, which was positive in 10% of the tumour cells. During the first two treatment cycles, the patient was well tolerated and already after the first cycle, a clear decrease in the size of the right lymph node mass was observed. During the third and fourth cycles, the patient presented grade 1 diarrhoea as adverse effects.
A control CT scan was performed after 4 cycles of treatment, showing resolution of the right laterocervical adenopathic conglomerate, a decrease in the size of the paramediastinal mass of the LSD (from 32 to 12 mm), a decrease in the size of the right adrenal lesion (from 63 to 60 mm) and resolution of the nodule in the right pararenal space. Thus, the patient showed a partial response after 4 cycles of nivolumab treatment.
Currently, the patient is still on nivolumab treatment, having received a total of 7 cycles corresponding to 3 months of treatment, and is awaiting re-evaluation of the disease.
