This is a 44-year-old male with HIV-HCV co-infection, who was being followed by the Infectious Diseases Unit of our hospital. His only relevant history was that he had been diagnosed with osteoporosis 5 years earlier. It was decided that he would be admitted to the ward for a study of constitutional syndrome. None of the usual battery of tests for the study of this syndrome yielded results except for the detection of a hormonal pattern diagnostic of primary hyperthyroidism. After consulting Endocrinology, he was finally diagnosed with primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) as the cause of his clinical picture. The results of the analytical determinations at the time of diagnosis were: TSH: 0.01 μUI/ml, FT4: 4.88 ng/dl and positive for TSH receptor antibodies. Thyroid scintigraphy showed homogeneous and diffuse radiotracer uptake. Treatment with thiamazole was started for hyperthyroidism at an initial dose of 30 mg daily in three doses. One month after discharge, he was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit with diarrhoea, diffuse abdominal pain, hypotension and non-specific asthenia. Laboratory tests showed hyponatraemia (133 mEq/l, normal values 135 - 145 mEq/l) and hyperkalaemia (5.2 mEq/l, normal range 3.5 - 5 mEq/l).
The hyperthyroidism was still uncontrolled, with persistently low TSH and elevated peripheral hormone levels (FT4 and FT3). Endocrinology was consulted again and the diagnosis of suspected AI was established. The adrenal axis study confirmed the suspicion. Baseline serum cortisol levels were 1.1 μg/dl, accompanied by suppressed ACTH levels (<5 pg/ml). Cosyntropin stimulation test showed an insufficient adrenal response (7.6 μg/dl and 10.7 μg/dl at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively). Anti-adrenal cortex antibodies and the search for tuberculosis were negative. In view of the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency, pituitary hormonal study was completed (PRL 17.6 ng/ml [4- 23]; IGF-1 128 ng/ml [90-360 for age and sex]; GH 3.2 ng/ml [<10]; FSH 7.1 U/L [1.5-12.4]; LH 4.7 U/L [1.7-8.6]; total testosterone 124 ng/dl [250-836]), and a pituitary MRI was performed and showed no alterations.
In the absence of other causes of inhibition of the pituitary axis, we considered a probable pharmacological aetiology and the patient was re-interrogated in a targeted manner to rule out the recent use or cessation of drugs or products with a corticoid effect.
The patient was prescribed 240 mg/day of MA some 11 years ago, which he took irregularly, depending on his appetite. During that time, he went for long periods of time without taking it, but never suffered any adverse effects. She resumed taking it a year before her first admission and, both then and now, had continued to take it with no change in dosage or frequency of use. At that time, she stopped taking MA and was started on hydrocortisone, with symptoms gradually disappearing. During follow-up, the dose of corticosteroids was progressively decreased and she received radioiodine to control her hyperthyroidism. One year later, cortisol and ACTH levels were normal (19.8 μg/dl and 5.79 μg/ml respectively) with no need to maintain corticosteroid therapy. Similarly, testosterone levels were normalised. Table 1 summarises the most relevant analytical findings.
The definitive diagnosis of the patient was secondary adrenal insufficiency due to inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by AM precipitated by primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism.
