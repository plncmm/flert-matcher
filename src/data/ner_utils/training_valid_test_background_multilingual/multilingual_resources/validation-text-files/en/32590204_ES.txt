A 58-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department due to decreased consciousness and inability to walk. Initial symptoms began with gait disturbance approximately one month prior to admission, with a slow progressive worsening; however, the state of consciousness deteriorated profoundly two days prior to admission. No pulmonary symptoms such as cough or dyspnoea were reported. On admission, his temperature was 37.1 oC; the patient was drowsy but could obey instructions to perform simple tasks; speech consisted of simple, short words. He could move all limbs, but the upper limbs showed less mobility. Osteotendinous reflexes were blunted and the plantar cutaneous reflex showed Babinski's sign. Initial tests revealed Hb: 15.5 g/dL, white blood cells: 17,000 [lymphocytes: 1020/mm3, normal range: 800-5000/mm3], C-reactive protein: 82 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/L), ESR: 40 mm/h (normal < 20 mm/h) and ferritin 876 ng/mL (normal range: 12 to 300 ng/mL). CSF analysis revealed leukocytes: 0/mm3 (normal range: 0-5/mm3), glucose: 105 mg/dL (normal < 80 mg/dL) and protein: 15 mg/dL (normal < 45 mg/dL). CSF was negative for viruses, such as herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. In addition, no oligoclonal bands were found in the CSF. The interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis and the ELISA assay for Brucella and HIV antibodies were negative. A brain MRI showed diffuse confluent white matter hyperintensity on FLAIR MRI, especially on the left side, without prominent T1-weighted enhancement. In addition, involvement of the cortical and deep grey matter and the dorsal midbrain was evident. A chest CT scan indicated bilateral peripheral multifocal multifocal consolidations with air bronchogram consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR assays from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, but these were negative in CSF. For treatment of ADE, dexamethasone i.v. 8 mg three times daily was started, which led to an improvement in mental status after two days. At that time, the patient was able to communicate verbally; he was oriented to time and people and could walk with assistance. The pulmonology service applied the pneumological treatment in the intensive care unit. However, after 10 days, the status epilepticus worsened and the patient died one day later, probably due to status epilepticus.
