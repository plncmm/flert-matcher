In April 2020, a 57-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with fever and non-productive cough of 8 days' duration. Six days before admission, the patient visited his general practitioner. The patient had tested positive for influenza A from a nasopharyngeal swab test. He was prescribed laninamivir, but his symptoms did not improve. Two days before admission, the patient was referred to our hospital because of persistent fever. An anteroposterior chest X-ray found ground-glass opacities in the left lung and he was treated with garenoxacin. Later, real-time RT-PCR results from his nasopharyngeal swab were positive for SARS-CoV-2. His medical history indicated vasospastic angina and diabetes mellitus. His medication consisted of sitagliptin and miglitol. He worked in customer service in a restaurant. He had no history of smoking, travel or contact with sick people.
On admission, the patient reported dyspnoea, anosmia and ageusia. Vital signs were as follows: temperature 38.8 °C; blood pressure 131/74 mm Hg; pulse 80 bpm; respiratory rate 20 bpm; oxygen saturation 91% on room air with desaturation on minimal exertion.
A complete blood count gave a leucocyte count of 8.3×109/L (neutrophils, 86%; lymphocytes, 8%; monocytes, 6%); haemoglobin 144 g/L; mean globular volume, 96 fL; thrombocytes, 199×109/L. Serological results were as follows: total protein, 6.5 g/dL; albumin, 3.1 g/dL; toral bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 103 IU/L; alanine aminotransaminase, 161 IU/L; g-glutamyltransferase, 114 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 416 IU/L; urea nitrogen, 11 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.8 mg/dL; sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 4.6 mmol/L; chloride, 97 mmol/L; glucose, 231 mg/dL; haemoglobin A1c, 7. 2%; ferritin, 1695 ng/mL; C-reactive protein, 15.7 mg/dL; procalcitonin, < 0.1 ng/mL. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B virus antibodies were negative. An ECG was normal. An anteroposterior chest X-ray revealed consolidation in the left lung. A subsequent chest CT scan revealed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities with consolidation and visible intralobular lines (cobblestone pattern). Sputum cultures for bacteria, fungi and acid fast bacilli were all negative.
Initial considerations for this patient presenting acutely with fever and cough were infection with a common virus (rhinovirus, non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and influenza) as well as community-acquired pneumonia. The rapid antigen test and his clinical course gave weight to the possibility of pneumonia. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Japan, the possibility of COVID-19 also needed to be considered.
Treatment with ciclesonide inhaler (200 μg twice daily for 14 days), favipiravir (1800 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 800 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and azithromycin) was initiated.
Shortly after hospitalisation, the patient developed progressive hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation of 91% with nasal cannula at 2 L/min). Fever continued for the first 4 days of hospitalisation, but then subsided. On hospital day 7, dyspnoea and hypoxaemia improved. According to the discharge criteria for confirmed cases of COVID in Japan (2 negative rRT-PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours and clinical improvement of signs and symptoms), the patient was discharged 4 weeks after admission.
