Anamnesis
A 62-year-old man with gastro-oesophageal reflux, benign prostatic hypertrophy and occasional low back pain as the only history of interest, on treatment with levosulpiride, serenoa repens and etoricoxib, was brought to the emergency department. The reason was that he had suddenly presented with an episode of decreased level of consciousness and loss of strength in the right hemibody with subsequent fall to the floor and altered speech output, with no other associated symptoms. The day before, he had been on a 12-hour transatlantic flight during which he had adopted abnormal sleeping postures. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed indirect signs of acute ischaemic stroke and intravenous fibrinolysis was performed, with no initial clinical improvement.

Physical examination
Temperature 36.3 oC, blood pressure 111/95 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, oxygen saturation 97%, BM test 137 mg/dl. Good general condition, normohydrated, perfused and coloured. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal auscultation without alterations. Pulses preserved in the upper and lower limbs. No signs of deep vein thrombosis.
Neurological examination: vigil, Glasgow scale score 11/15 (O4 V1 M6), global aphasia. Pupils isochoric and normoreactive. Preserved external ocular movements. Right central facial paralysis. Right homonymous hemianopsia. Muscle balance 0/5 in the right upper limb, 1/5 in the right lower limb. Left flexor flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex, right extensor. Right facial-brachio-crural hypoaesthesia. NIHSS: 0-2-2-2- 0-2-2-2-4-4-0-4-0-0-0-0-1-3-0-0 = 20 points.

Complementary tests
- Basic laboratory tests: total cholesterol 221 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 150 mg/dl, triglycerides 163 mg/dl. Other parameters of biochemistry, haemacytometry, coagulation, thyroid hormones and tumour markers were within normal limits.
- Microbiology: negative serology for hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and positive for syphilis (IgG, RPR, TPPA).
- Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, without pulmonary infiltrates or costophrenic sinus impingement.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, occasional atrial extrasystoles, no acute repolarisation abnormalities.
- Holter ECG: sinus rhythm with isolated low-density VES and occasional PVCs.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram: no significant alterations.
- Urgent transcranial Doppler (during intravenous fibrinolysis): occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery with decreased proximal flows compared to the contralateral one. Velocities of the ACA and left posterior cerebral artery within the normal range.
- Supra-aortic trunks duplex (TSA): shock wave in ACI-I. Suspected dissection of ICA-I with distal occlusion. Rest without significant alterations.
- Cranial CT scan: hypodensity of the lenticular nucleus, loss of cortico-subcortical differentiation of the insula and of the p√≥stero-basal portion of the frontal lobe and of the ipsilateral temporal pole with hyperdensity of the left middle cerebral artery.
- Post-fibrinolysis cranial CT scan: hyperdensity of the cavernous ICA, supraclinoid, and left M1. Hypodensity of the insular border, lenticular nucleus, left frontal and temporal operculum and partial left caudate nucleus (ASPECTS 5-6). Grade 1 oedema. No signs of haemorrhage. Cerebral CT scan after intravenous fibrinolysis: hypodensity of the insular rim, lenticular nucleus, caudate nucleus and left frontal and temporal operculum, compatible with cerebral infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery.
- Cerebral angio-CT and TSA: acute infarction of the left middle cerebral artery (ASPECTS 5-6), without evidence of mismatch, secondary to occlusion of the bifurcation of the intracranial ICA, origin ACA and middle cerebral artery (M1-M2-M3), T thrombus. Absence of filling of the left cervical ICA from 20 mm from its origin in the bifurcation, possibly due to circulatory slowing associated with distal occlusion, although the main differential diagnosis would be carotid dissection. CT angiography of the supra-aortic trunks and the polygon of Willis. Left carotid CT angiography showing absence of filling of the cervical internal carotid artery from 20 mm from its origin at the bifurcation. Angio-CT scan of the polygon of Willis showing occlusion of the bifurcation of the intracranial internal carotid artery, originating in the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery.

Diagnosis
Acute cerebral infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery of unusual origin. Dissection of the left internal carotid artery. Positive syphilitic serology.

Treatment and evolution
During admission the patient remained clinically and haemodynamically stable. In the presence of extensive infarction with signs of grade 1 oedema, intravenous mannitol was started. Given the positive result for syphilis in the blood, and after ruling out a lumbar puncture due to the risk of complications in this patient, the cardiologist was consulted to assess a possible luteal aortitis, considered aortic involvement unlikely and only recommended continuing antibiotic treatment with benzylpenicillin 4 million intravenous every 6 hours for 14 days and that, once he had arrived in his country of origin, his doctors should assess the administration of benzathine penicillin in a single dose one week after the date of discharge. At discharge, aphasia and right hemiparesis persisted, with an NIHSS of 18 points and 5 points on the modified Rankin scale. The patient was referred to a rehabilitation centre.
