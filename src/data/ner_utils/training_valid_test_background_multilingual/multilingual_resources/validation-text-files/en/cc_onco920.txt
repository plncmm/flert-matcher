Anamnesis
Male, 73 years old, independent for basic activities of daily living. Ex-smoker for 22 years and no other toxic habits. Medical history of interest: long-standing arterial hypertension, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with home oxygen therapy. On regular treatment with antihypertensives, pantoprazole and aerosol therapy.
He was diagnosed in October 2014 with adenocarcinoma of the distal third of the oesophagus (T3Nx, M0 c-erb2 negative), being presented to the Oncology Committee to assess resectability, which was rejected due to high pulmonary comorbidity and high surgical risk requiring total oesophagastrectomy. For this reason, it was finally decided to treat with concomitant chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy.
He received treatment with paclitaxel + weekly carboplatin, as well as radiotherapy (50Gy) from February to April 2015. Stabilisation of the disease was observed in both CT and gastroscopy, so it was decided to follow up in consultation.
She was admitted in September 2016 for high-grade febrile syndrome accompanied by chills and shivering with no apparent focus. During the same, imaging tests (CT) revealed a new hypodense splenic lesion, which could be related to a metastatic lesion.
In view of these findings, the disease was considered to be progressing and FOLFIRI chemotherapy was started with palliative intent (he received up to three cycles).
In October 2016, the patient was readmitted due to a fever peak without identifying any cause. A study was performed with labelled leukocytes without detecting any lesion with avidity for the tracer, so an infectious focus was ruled out at this time. A repeat abdominal CT scan was performed for re-evaluation, showing an increase in the size of the splenic lesion with respect to previous studies (from 22 mm to 35 mm).
The patient was admitted again in October 2016, with a new febrile condition of up to 38.5oC, with poor closure of the surgical wound after reservoir implantation (port a cath), although with no signs of superinfection. Blood cultures isolated Streptococcus intermedius and antibiotic treatment was started, and the reservoir was removed and placed on the contralateral side without incident.
In December 2016, he was readmitted with septic shock, requiring treatment with noradrenaline due to a new high-grade febrile syndrome with 24 hours of evolution, accompanied by chills and shivering. There was no evidence of focus: the patient reported no respiratory symptoms, alterations in gastrointestinal habits, micturition or any other type of clinical manifestations.

Physical examination
On arrival at the ED, the patient was febrile (38.7oC), with blood pressure of 110/65 mm Hg. He maintains good diuresis and acceptable saturation with nasal spectacles at 3L.
The patient is conscious, oriented and cooperative. General condition is not affected. Good perfusion and hydration. During cardiorespiratory auscultation, arrhythmic tones and hypoventilation in the left base are appreciated. Abdomen is excavated, soft and depressible, painless, without palpable masses or megaliths, no signs of peritonism and hydro-aerial sounds are present.
The reservoir region shows no signs of superinfection and no pain on palpation.

Complementary tests
Laboratory tests on admission: mild leukocytosis (10.3 x 10.9/l) with high elevation of procalcitonin (22.84 ng/ml) and CRP (114 mg/l).
An admission x-ray was also performed, which did not show any clear images of condensation or effusion.
On the ward, echocardiography was performed, which was negative for endocarditis, as well as a thoracoabdominal CT scan showing three large hypodense lesions with fluid density distributed from the hilum to the periphery, from which infection could not be ruled out, as well as moderate pleural effusion.
In view of these findings, an abdominal echo study was performed, which revealed two visible heterogeneous areas (predominantly hypoechogenic) measuring up to 45 x 39 mm in diameter, which appeared to be splenic abscesses.
Differential blood cultures were taken (reservoir and peripheral route), in which Staphylococcus epidermidis grew with no significant differential growth time.

Diagnosis
Given these findings in the complementary tests and based on the patient's clinical manifestations, a diagnosis of bacteraemia due to multisensitive Streptococcus intermedius was made, causing the fever, and the three splenic lesions were diagnosed as abscesses, probably being the initial infectious focus, with associated pleural effusion.

Treatment
Initially, given the picture of septic shock and high elevation of acute phase reactants, the patient received empirical antibiotic coverage with cefepime, de-escalating to ceftriaxone after isolation of S. epidermidis in blood cultures. After clinical stabilisation, Pleur-evac was placed and ultrasound-guided puncture-aspiration drainage of two of the three splenic collections was performed (one of them persisted as it was not accessible), the culture of which was also positive for S. intermedius.
Given the patient's general condition and the significant infectious picture, it was decided to pause chemotherapy treatment for the time being.

Evolution
The patient showed a very good clinical evolution, with disappearance of fever and improvement in general condition. In addition, there was a favourable radiological evolution of splenic abscesses with a significant reduction in size in response to antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged home with the same antimicrobial treatment.
Four weeks later, the general condition continued to deteriorate, and a CT scan showed persistent splenic lesions that led us to assume a metastatic origin with superinfection of the lesions.
A re-evaluation CT scan was requested, showing progression of the oncological disease with an increase in the size of the tumour in the distal oesophagus extending to the oesophagogastric junction and fundus, as well as epiploic nodules suggestive of nodular implants.
Due to these findings and the patient's poor general condition, it was decided to definitively suspend chemotherapy treatment and refer the patient to the Continuing Care Unit for follow-up.
