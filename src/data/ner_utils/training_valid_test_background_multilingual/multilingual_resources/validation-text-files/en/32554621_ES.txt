A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a severe recurrence of ulcerative colitis.
On admission, he was taking mesalazine in oral and topical formulation, and reported up to 12 bloody stools. Laboratory tests showed mild normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 123 g/L), neutrophilic leukocytosis (neutrophils 9420/μL), increased C-reactive protein (17.1 mg/dL; normal value < 0.5 mg/dL) and hypoalbuminaemia (3.2 g/dL). A colonoscopy revealed heavily ulcerated mucosa and a histological examination confirmed severe and active ulcerative colitis. Chest and abdominal radiographs were normal. Treatment was started with i.v. methylprednisolone (60 mg/day). (60 mg/day), rehydration and antithrombotic prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Stool culture, Clostridium difficile toxin test and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test were all negative. Infection screening, recommended before starting biological therapies, was negative.
After 5 days of i.v. methylprednisolone, the patient's general condition and clinical status improved slightly; C-reactive protein values had dropped to 0.95 mg/dL. A proctosigmoidoscopy excluded cytomegalovirus infection. At this time, salvage treatment would have been appropriate, but the patient developed fever, dyspnoea and cough. Laboratory tests showed a further increase in C-reactive protein (3.98 mg/dL). A high-resolution CT scan showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, indicative of severe interstitial pneumonia. A new nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; steroid treatment was progressively tapered and oral administration was switched to. We assessed serum interleukin-6 concentration, which was high (37.4 pg/mL; normal values 0-7 pg/mL). 
For ulcerative colitis, medical and surgical options were considered. Surgery was considered contraindicated in a patient with COVID-19, which could complicate the postoperative course and be life-threatening. Consequently, infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg was chosen. 
After 7 days on infliximab, the patient's intestinal symptoms and general condition improved significantly. A high-resolution CT scan showed a clear improvement, with a reduction in the extent and density of ground-glass opacities. Laboratory tests showed normalisation of C-reactive protein (0.12 mg/dL) and decrease of IL-6 concentration to 15.9 pg/mL; two consecutive tests for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with two bloodless stools.
