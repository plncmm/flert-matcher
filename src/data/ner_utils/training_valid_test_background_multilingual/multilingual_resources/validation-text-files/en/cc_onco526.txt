Anamnesis

45-year-old male with no known drug allergies, active smoker with a cumulative rate of 10 pack-years, drinker of 30 g of ethanol daily, regular cocaine user until 8 months ago; with a personal history of sepsis due to right upper lobe pneumonia in 2010 that required admission to the Intensive Care unit and inverted psoriasis diagnosed in Dermatology in October 2018.
In February 2018, she consulted her primary care physician for ulcerated lesions on the external genitalia and inguinal fold. He received topical antifungal and steroid treatment for several months without improvement and, in October 2018, he was referred to Dermatology and diagnosed with inverse psoriasis.
At the same time, in September 2018, he began to experience pain and conjunctival hyperemia in his left eye, for which he visited the emergency department on several occasions. He was assessed by Ophthalmology in November 2018, and the condition was attributed to viral conjunctivitis and he was prescribed topical treatment based on corticosteroid eye drops. Given the refractory nature of the symptoms, the patient was referred to Rheumatology for screening for systemic disease due to suspicion of scleritis and a conjunctival biopsy was performed. The anatomopathological result was Kaposi's sarcoma with expression of CD31 and HHV-8, and the patient was referred to the Infectious Diseases Unit.

Physical examination
In January 2019, the patient was referred to us for assessment, at which time he presented ECOG 1, chemosis and intense subconjunctival haemorrhage in the left eye, as well as several skin lesions on the root of the right lower limb and right buttock suggestive of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma. He also reported profuse night sweats and unquantified weight loss.

Complementary tests
In December 2018, serology was performed with positive result for HIV-1/HIV-2 and viral load of 2,440,000 copies/ml (6.39 log). The cellular immunity study showed a very low absolute CD4 lymphocyte count (26 cells/ul), while the complete blood count and biochemistry including liver function tests were normal.
In January 2019, the study was completed with a computed tomography (CT) scan describing splenomegaly of 13 cm, as well as left inguinal nodes up to 1 cm and in iliac chains, all of which were non-specific.

Diagnosis
Based on the above-mentioned data, the diagnosis of T1 (genital) I1 (CD4 26) S1 (B symptoms) conjunctival Kaposi's sarcoma was established.

Treatment
On 20 December 2018, antiretroviral treatment with emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide and raltegravir, as well as prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was instituted.

Evolution
During the first month of antiretroviral treatment, there was a slight worsening of the ocular condition, but with an improvement in the skin lesions, possibly related to immune reconstitution. In agreement with the Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology service, it was agreed to wait a few weeks to monitor the evolution and, from the second month of treatment, the patient has progressively improved at all levels with good tolerance to the treatment.
