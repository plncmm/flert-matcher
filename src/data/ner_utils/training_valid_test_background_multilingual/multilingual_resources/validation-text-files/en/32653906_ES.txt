15-year-old adolescent with frontal headache with retro-orbital pain, fever and intense sweating. On May 5, the patient reported emetic episodes, weakness and pain in the lower extremities, which progressed to his upper extremities. On 8 May, with no history of surgery or hospitalisation, and no recent vaccination, he was admitted to a local paediatric hospital. A rapid COVID-19 test was positive for IgG and IgM. Initial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests (cytometry, biochemistry) and aerobic CSF cultures performed on admission revealed no abnormalities. The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone, azithromycin, albendazole and, 3 days later, was transferred to the COVID referral hospital in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. On admission to the hospital, the patient was in good general condition, with no respiratory symptoms. Neurological examination showed normal consciousness and speech, normal cranial nerve activity, progressive symmetrical weakness of the limbs (Medical Research Council score 3/5 for the upper and 2/5 for the lower limbs), absence of osteotendinous reflexes, normal Babinski's sign and no sensory loss.
Nasopharyngeal swabs analysed by PCR were negative for influenza and positive for SARS-CoV-2. Another CSF cytometric and biochemical analysis, about 2 weeks after the initial non-specific symptoms, gave results within normal parameters. CSF PCR was negative for the most common viruses (herpes 1, herpes 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, varicella zoster, zika, dengue and chikungunya), as well as for SARS-CoV-2. A thoracic and cranial CT scan and a thoracic, cranial and lumbar MRI revealed no abnormalities. Blood tests, including complete blood count, serum glucose, C-reactive protein, electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes were within normal limits. Serology for hepatitis B and C, HIV and venereal disease tests were negative. An electroneurogram revealed normal sensory action potentials, although with a large reduction in action potential amplitude in all motor nerves studied, with relatively preserved conduction velocities. F waves were absent in all nerves studied. These abnormalities are consistent with acute motor axonal neuropathy in GBS. 
Given the patient's clinical history of progressive symmetrical weakness, supported by electroneurogram results, recent SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR, negative microbiological results for other causes in CSF and normal MRI, GBS associated with COVID-19 was diagnosed. On 15 May, the patient started treatment with 400 mg/kg/day of i.v. immunoglobulin on a 5-day regimen. Despite some improvement after IG therapy, the upper and lower extremity weakness persisted and the patient is currently undergoing physiotherapy.
