We present the case of a 61 year old male from Equatorial Guinea, obese, type 2 diabetic, recently arrived from Equatorial Guinea with febrile fever, micturition syndrome and hyperglycaemia. On examination he presented with hepatomegaly and large splenomegaly at 10 cm of the costal margin. Laboratory tests showed: leukocytes 9,100/μl, lymphocytes 62.8%, haemoglobin 9.8 g/dl, MCV 82.4, platelets 78,000/μl, glucose 692 mg/dl, creatinine 1.69 mg/dl, GOT U/L, 275 U/L, GPT 200 U/L, GGT 337 U/L, IgM 374 mg/dl. Abdominal CT confirmed hepatomegaly with portal hypertension (PHT), splenomegaly of 16 cm and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy. Urine culture showed Klebsiella pneumoniae BLEE. The thick blood smear was negative with positive PCR and serology 1/640 for P. falciparum, positive HCV serology with viral load 6,153,616 IU/ml. Imipenem-cilastatin, Dihydroartemisinin/Piperaquine and glycaemic control with insulin and serum therapy were prescribed with clinical and analytical improvement.
The patient fulfilled diagnostic criteria for HME: splenomegaly > 10 cm, IgM and high titres of antimalarial antibodies and positive PCR for P. falciparum. As lymphocytosis persisted, a bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood cytometry showed a low-grade splenic marginal zone B lymphoma. This lymphoma is associated with chronic HCV infections. MSM has also been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. The association of the development of lymphomas with chronic antigenic stimulation by other infections such as H. pylori, EBV or HHV8 has now been confirmed. In this patient, three interrelated aetiologies of splenomegaly coexist (EMH, lymphoma, PTH) with a diagnostic difficulty that requires high clinical suspicion and specialised tests. Another point of interest is the possibility of remission of lymphoma and splenomegaly with treatment for HCV and malaria.
The patient decided to return to his country and permanent malaria prophylaxis with chloroquine, HCV treatment and analytical check-ups were recommended.
