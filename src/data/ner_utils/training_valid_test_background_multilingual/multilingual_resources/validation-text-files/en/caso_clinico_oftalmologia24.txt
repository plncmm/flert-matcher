We present the case of a 24-year-old woman with a painless and progressive decrease in bilateral visual acuity (VA) over the last 4 days. The anamnesis highlights that a week before the ophthalmological symptoms she had suffered a pseudo-flu-like illness with fever of 38.5° C for 3 days of evolution without other associated symptoms. There was no previous history of foreign travel, ingestion of undercooked meat or contact with animals. The general examination was also unremarkable with no skin or other abnormalities.

Ophthalmological examination showed VA of 0.15 in both eyes (AO) which did not improve with pinhole. In the anterior segment there was a positive Tyndall (+) in AO. Funduscopic examination showed bilateral optic disc oedema, retinal oedema in the posterior pole, areas of periphlebitis affecting the posterior pole and, more markedly in the periphery -at 360°-, the venules had an irregular calibre with narrowing, blurring of their borders, yellow-grey perivascular infiltrates and segmentation of the blood column. Discrete localised vitritis was seen in the areas of periphlebitis.

Suspecting neuroretinitis, the following complementary tests were ordered: blood count, basic biochemistry, sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), chest X-ray and cranial computed tomography (CT). The results showed a leukocytosis of 18,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils and a CRP of 0.1. All other tests were normal. The patient was admitted in order to complete the study. Complete biochemistry, coagulation, rheumatic tests, immunoglobulins, Mantoux intradermal reaction, proteinogram, gamma globulins, ANA, ENA, ANCA and ECA and serology were requested: toxoplasma, bartonella, HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, HSV, EBV, LUES, borrelia, chlamydia, histoplasmosis, toxocara and rose bengal.

To control the evolution, treatment was started with oral prednisone (40 mg in the morning, 20 mg in the afternoon), prednisone eye drops, diclofenac and cycloplegic.

In the first 7 days VA progressed to 0.3 in the OD and 0.4 in the left eye (LO). Retinal oedema of the posterior pole decreased and a macular star appeared in both eyes. In addition, periphlebitis decreased to almost disappearance and the dose of oral corticosteroid was reduced. Fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papillary oedema and a discrete accumulation of contrast in the macular region of the AO. Tyndall was still positive (+) in the anterior chamber in AO. Given the clinical suspicion of neuroretinitis, treatment was started with 500 mg of ciprofloxacin every 12 hours, a descending course of corticosteroids and the patient was discharged from hospital with an appointment in one week to check the results of the serology tests.

At 2 weeks the VA improved to 0.5 in the OD and 0.7 in the OI. In the FO, the macular star persisted, although retinal and papillary oedema were smaller and there were no areas of periphlebitis. Anterior chamber Tyndall was negative. Ocular hypertension appeared but was controlled with the withdrawal of topical corticosteroid and the use of a topical beta-blocker.

At 3 weeks the VA was 0.8 in AO. The macular star persisted and there was no evidence of papillary or macular oedema. Serology results were received and IgM was positive for chlamydia, the rest being negative. At this point the patient recognised abnormal vaginal discharge during the fever the week before the ophthalmological symptoms, so ciprofloxacin was replaced by oral doxycycline for the patient and her partner. At 4 weeks the VA was 0.8 in the OD and 1 in the OI and the macular star persisted. At 8 weeks VA was 1 in AO and traces of macular star were visible in AO. At 16 weeks no traces of macular star are seen in either eye. Positive IgM to chlamydia persists.
