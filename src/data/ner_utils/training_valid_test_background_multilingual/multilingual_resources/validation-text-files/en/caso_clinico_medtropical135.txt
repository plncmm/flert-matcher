Personal history
Male, 25 years old, Swedish student and resident in Spain for two months, with no pathological history of interest.

Present illness
He consulted the emergency department for fever of 39oC with arthralgias and profuse sweating of 48 hours of evolution. Eighteen days earlier he had returned from Morocco after a stay in the Atlas Mountains, reporting an episode of self-limited diarrhoea during the trip. A week after his return, he presented again with diarrhoea, without pathological products, and fever for five days, which subsided after treatment with ciprofloxacin.

Physical examination
Conscious and oriented, with acceptable general condition, normal colour and well perfused, with a temperature of 39oC. Blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm and arterial oxygen saturation 99% (FiO2 0.21). No lymphadenopathy on palpation, no nuchal rigidity, no meningeal signs. On cardiac auscultation he was rhythmic, tachycardic, with a panfocal systolic murmur I/VI. Pulmonary auscultation showed preserved vesicular murmur in both hemithoraxes with no other added sounds. As for the abdomen, he had a palpable hepatomegaly of about 2-3 finger widths, which was depressible, non-painful and had normal hydro-aerial sounds. There were no signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis, with full and symmetrical pulses.

Complementary examinations
The haemoglobin level was 11 g/dL, MCV 85 fl, 1,520 leukocytes/Î¼L and 38,000 platelets. The most important results of the
The blood biochemistry was total bilirubin 3.11 mg/dL at the expense of the indirect fraction, GOT 43 IU/L, LDH 713 IU/L and CRP 9 mg/dL as abnormal data. The determination of antinuclear antibodies was normal. Chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The abdominal ultrasound showed discrete hepatomegaly. Blood cultures and serologies against Salmonella, Brucella, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Borrelia, Leishmania, Parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex, Toxoplasma and syphilis were negative.

Diagnostic test
Thick drop and fine smear of peripheral blood: Giemsa staining showed intra-erythrocytic forms suggestive of Plasmodium vivax infection.

Clinical judgement
P. vivax malaria.

Evolution
In the absence of recently described cases of malaria in the area of Morocco where he had travelled, we re-interviewed the patient, referring a previous trip to Indonesia two years earlier with correct compliance with the antimalarial prophylaxis regimen with chloroquine.
We started treatment with quinine (10 mg/kg) and doxycycline (100mg/12 hours) for seven days and then radical treatment with primaquine (0.25 mg/kg for 14 days) after ruling out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, with the fever disappearing and the three series of the haemogram normalising. Two weeks after finishing treatment, he consulted again for fever and sweating, which was interpreted as a recurrence of the infection due to probable tolerance to primaquine (described in Indonesia). He started treatment with quinine and primaquine again, this time at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (30 mg/day) for fourteen days, with complete resolution of the symptoms.
