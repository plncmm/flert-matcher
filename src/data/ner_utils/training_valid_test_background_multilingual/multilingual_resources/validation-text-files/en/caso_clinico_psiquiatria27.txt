A 19 year old male was brought to the clinic by his family because of abnormal behaviour over the last three or four days. The family had come two days earlier to ask for help on how to convince the patient to come to the clinic.
When he comes to the clinic, the patient has a partial awareness of illness, being aware that something strange is happening to him: he reports that since last weekend, where he had consumed between 10 and 15 cannabis consumptions a day, he feels that the people around him look at him differently, as if they were watching him. In his usual job (he is a waiter in a bar) he interprets people's gestures towards him as disgust, "as if they were censoring him for what he does". At home he is angry and distant, "as if isolated, in his own world", and at some point, when showing interest in what is happening to him, he has responded aggressively. As this situation worsened, they went for consultation.
The family described him as "a good boy", somewhat shy and with some difficulty in social relations. He had left school a year earlier and had started working in a bar belonging to an acquaintance, without any problems. The family is dysfunctional, with separation of the parents 4 years ago, with a bad relationship between them. He is the third of 5 siblings, with a bad relationship between all of them, having taken different sides after the separation of the parents. No family history of mental pathology. He has been a cannabis user since the age of 13, with initial weekend use with friends of two to three times a day. Subsequently, after the separation of his parents (he was 15 years old), his consumption increased to daily use, 5-6 times/day. No consumption of other intoxicants (sporadic alcohol). Recently the consumption was 10 joints a day.
The family reports that they had a very bad time after the separation of the parents. They also cite two or three previous episodes similar to the current one, following heavy cannabis use at the weekend, which subsided without treatment after abstinence.
The patient admits taking medication for a month (risperidone is administered, up to 3 mg/day): at subsequent appointments, a complete remission of symptoms and intolerance to the side effects of the treatment (sedation) are observed, which is why he stops treatment and consultations. In telephone checks, the family reports that the patient is well and has not resumed consumption.
Two years later, he went with his family to the Emergency Department of the Provincial Hospital for a similar episode, with greater behavioural disorders (verbal aggression at home and at work), lasting a week. The symptoms were similar, although he presented with auditory pseudo-hallucinations (voices that were shouting at him). He had not agreed to go for a consultation and after breaking a piece of furniture at home, the family forced him to accompany them to the emergency room. He was admitted for a short stay in order to achieve abstinence from cannabis (he had started using again 6 months earlier, increasing his consumption to 4-5 times/day at present) and to start treatment, which he accepted. During admission, the same treatment was administered at a dose of 2 mg/day and a rapid remission of symptoms was observed, with the patient requesting voluntary discharge 5 days after admission. Before leaving, risperidone was administered in depot form due to a history of treatment abandonment (25 mg/14 days).
In subsequent controls, the patient remained abstinent from cannabis and did not present psychotic symptoms; he did present mild depressive symptoms reactive to the experience of the problems caused to the family. Subsequently, he abandoned the treatment and the consultations were established again every three months. After six months, the psychotic symptoms reappeared following cannabis consumption (which he had resumed three months earlier, consuming 8-10 times a day), this time with auditory hallucinations in the second and third person, which made him so angry that he had presented severe suicidal ideas, which is why the family took him back to A&E. In this case, he was admitted involuntarily. In this case, admission was involuntary (given the high risk of suicide and the lack of awareness of illness). Admission lasted two months, and he was discharged with depot neuroleptics and partial remission of symptoms, with a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.
