46-year-old man with Brugada syndrome type I and hypertension. He had recently changed his medication to ixekizumab 80 mg after secondary ineffectiveness of ustekinumab 45 mg for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. One week after the first dose of ixekizumab, the patient developed fever and malaise. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four days after symptom onset, he presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea and chest pain. Oxygen saturation was 90%; a chest ultrasound was consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia; chest X-ray showed no pulmonary opacities or pleural effusion. The patient was hospitalised and treated with 400 mg hydroxychloroquine twice daily orally on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily, 1 g ceftriaxone twice daily intramuscularly, and non-invasive continuous positive mechanical ventilation (CPP) in cycles of prone ventilation. Antivirals were not administered because of the risk of arrhythmia. Fever subsided after 14 days, allowing transition from CPAP to low-flow oxygen therapy. The patient was discharged after 22 days, with an oxygen saturation of 97% on gait test. Two repeat nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were negative 30 days after diagnosis.
