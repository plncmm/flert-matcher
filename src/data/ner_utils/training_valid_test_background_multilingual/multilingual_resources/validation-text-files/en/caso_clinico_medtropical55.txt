A 59-year-old male patient, farmer from El Caf√©, Miranda state. He had been ill for five years without medical treatment. It began with the appearance of a small, non-painful ulcer in the right lumbar region, which progressively increased in size and advanced towards the right gluteal region and upper part of the homolateral thigh. Five months prior to the consultation, the patient presented with general malaise and went to an outpatient clinic where he was prescribed oral antibiotics and topical cures without improvement, for which he was referred to the Institute of Tropical Medicine. Epidemiological and personal history. Day labourer in agricultural activities, harvesting vegetables in the area of Higuerote (Barlovento, Miranda State). Currently unemployed and destitute. Consuetudent alcoholic, drinking a bottle of white rum every day since he was 26 years old. Physical examination: patient in apparent good general condition, accentuated dorsolumbar kyphosis; dark brown skin. Vital signs: HR: 102 beats per minute (bpm), FR: 24 breaths per minute (rpm), BP: 130-90 mm Hg. Chest asymmetrical due to kyphoscoliosis. Respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and genito-urinary without obvious abnormalities, abdomen globose, presence of umbilical hernia; no visceromegaly was palpable and there was no pain on superficial or deep palpation. Skin: ulcerative lesion measuring 22 x 40 cm in the right lumbar region, with erythematous-violaceous borders, crusty, friable, with serosanguinous secretion and intercalated and hyperpigmented portions of skin, not painful to the touch, with the presence of a necrotic centre and several protruding ulcerative lesions with irregular borders (Figures 1 and 2). Cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily for six days was administered prior to skin sampling for apposition smear for Leismania amastigotes. Routine bioanalytical tests: Hb: 9.9 g/dL, Ht: 30.5 vol %, 8,500 leukocytes/mm3, 61% segmented, 30% lymphocytes and 9% eosinophils. Cardiovascular and electrocardiographic evaluation without evident alterations of cardiovascular disease. The following tests were also performed: leishmanin test: 15 mm; indirect fluorescent antileishmanial antibody 1:128 dils; smear by apposition of ulcerated skin with leishmanial parasite amastigotes present. A series of 4,500 mg meglumine/day for 10 consecutive days was administered. The patient improved and returned five months later with ulcers without evidence of healing. He was hospitalised and received a second course of meglumine antimoniate and the lesions improved satisfactorily. At subsequent check-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic.
