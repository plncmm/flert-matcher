A 46-year-old man from the town of Bernardo de Irigoyen arrived at the care centre in January 2014, 72 hours after the accident, complaining of general malaise and a sensation of neuralgia in one of his arms. He appeared lucid and with some haemorrhagic signs such as ecchymosis and haematomas on the left lower limb; body temperature was normal, blood pressure 160/100 mmHg and heart rate 90 beats/min. Laboratory values were: red blood cells 3 900 000/mm3; leukocytes 14 500 mm3; platelets 90 000/mm3; haematocrit 36%; haemoglobin 11 g/dl; prothrombin activity (PA) 60%; creatinine: 15 mg/l. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed the presence of abundant red blood cells (haematuria). At the 9a Regional de Saúde de Foz do Iguaçu (Brazil), the larvae of the causative animal brought by the patient at the time of consultation were identified as Lonomia obliqua (L. obliqua), and a diagnosis of Lonomia erucism was made. The patient received specific treatment with the antivenom together with support measures (adjuvant treatment) with corticoids (hydrocortisone), antibiotics (cephalothin), antihistamines (diphenhydramine) and vitamin K, with good tolerance to the administration of the heterologous serum. The evolution was satisfactory, normalising the paraclinical tests and the patient was haemodynamically compensated, afebrile and normotensive until his discharge from the institution.
