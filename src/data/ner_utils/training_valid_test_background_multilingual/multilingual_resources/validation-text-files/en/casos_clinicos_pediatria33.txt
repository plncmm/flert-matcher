REASON FOR CONSULTATION
A patient aged 7 years and 10 months came to the paediatric clinic with recurrent vomiting every day for a week, accompanied by intermittent diarrhoea.
The mother told us that she had been suffering for some weeks from abdominal pain in the epigastrium and periumbilical region, which she had considered to be of a "nervous type". She had not had a fever. No other notable clinical manifestations.

SITUATION OF THE PATIENT
AP: Patient diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome. Monitored by cardiology and ophthalmology with no notable alterations.
Examination in consultation: Good general condition. No clinical signs of dehydration. PCA: normal. ENT: normal. Negative meningeal signs. Abdomen soft, no defence, Blumberg negative. Diffuse pain in the abdomen.

Gastroenteritis was suspected, so it was decided to prescribe rehydration with serum and a soft diet. A stool culture and stool parasites were requested, as well as a breath test for Helicobacter Pylori due to a history of epigastric pain.
Five days after the consultation, she was admitted to the hospital emergency department due to persistent vomiting and diarrhoea.

EVOLUTION OF THE PATIENT AFTER DISCHARGE
The patient required intravenous and oral rehydration and was discharged as she presented clinical normalisation except for the persistence of abdominal discomfort and an appointment was made for paediatric gastroenterology consultations.
She went to the paediatric primary care clinic to report her admission and the mother was informed of the results of the breath test: 33.8% Normality: (0-2.5%).
The stool culture requested in consultation was negative.
The Digestive Service was informed of the result and, after being informed of the positive result of the breath test and not finding other causes for the patient's symptoms, decided to prescribe treatment with Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin (15 days) and Omeprazole (15 days). Digestive endoscopy was not performed.
The patient underwent treatment and was discharged from the gastroenterology department due to clinical normalisation.
