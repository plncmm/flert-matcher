We present the case of a 68-year-old man with no past history of interest who came to the dermatology emergency department of our hospital with a 5-day history of a very pruritic rash on the forearms and legs. The patient reported that 6 days earlier he had been cutting, pulling up and handling some plants that had invaded a friend's land, adjacent to a stream. During the process he was wearing shorts and a short-sleeved T-shirt. Thanks to the description and a photo that the patient later showed us, it was concluded that the plant belonged to the Anacardiaceae family, and was, more specifically, poison ivy.
On examination, the patient presented erythematous erythematous plaques and vesicles on both forearms and purpuric spots due to a confluence of punctate macules in the bilateral pretibial region. A biopsy of one of the lesions on the forearm showed a superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, spongiosis, lymphocyte exocytosis in the epidermis and oedema; data compatible with the diagnosis of eczema.
Betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g cream, twice daily, and oral antihistamines were prescribed. One month later, once the skin lesions had resolved, skin tests were performed (True TestÂ® battery), with negative readings at 48 and 96 hours. The diagnosis of acute irritant contact dermatitis due to poison ivy was therefore confirmed.
