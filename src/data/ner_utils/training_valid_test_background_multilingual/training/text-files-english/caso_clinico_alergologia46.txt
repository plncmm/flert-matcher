A 15-year-old male with a one-month history of lobar pneumonia and intermittent fever despite ampicillin.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with negative cultures and negative Quantiferon.
Cefuroxime is changed to clindamycin, persistent fever and radiological worsening.
BAL fluid was repeated: positive PCR for Aspergillus, culture and negative gauzemanan.
Good response to voriconazole.
Pulmonary aspergillosis in a previously healthy patient is imperative to study a chronic granulomatous disease (CGE), which was confirmed in the functional (oxidation test) and genetically (mutation of the NCF gene).
A 3-year-old male patient with sickle cell disease was admitted to hospital due to white adenopathy (white adenopathy, localised reactive arthritis), with an objective ACT-abdominal infiltrate due to pulmonary adenomegaly performed at the root.
A negative amount.
Two months later, a new CT scan showed two lung abscesses and mesenteric lymphadenopathy (some calcified and necrotic), with no clinical or analytical changes.
With suspicion of fungal infection, BAL was performed (culture negative and PCR negative) followed by lung segmentectomy (excision of lung abscesses), and empirical antibiotic therapy with voriconazole and antifungal was initiated.
The functional and genetic study confirmed the CGE (X-linked CYBB mutation).
After 2 weeks of culture, the fungus physissilis was isolated, sensitive to voriconazole.
Results: We illustrate the importance of pursuing the microbiological diagnosis in pulmonary infection with torpid evolution, although this requires invasive techniques of infrequent use in pediatrics.
The clinical and pathological evolution and the microbiological results oriented an underlying PID, the CGE, which often debuts with uncommon and difficult to isolate bacterial infections.
