Anamnesis A 47-year-old male smoker, with no other relevant medical history, was brought to the emergency department for cognitive impairment and fever of 40oC.
On physical examination, the patient was tachycardic, tachypneic, with obtundation and important psychomotor agitation.
Analytically; leukocytes 8810/μL with neutrophilia (86.6%), platelets 64000/μL, and elevation of acute phase reactants, with PCR 88 mg/dl and procalcitonin 1.79 mg.
Cranial CT was requested, with no findings, prior to performing lumbar puncture, obtaining in cerebrospinal fluid: total proteins 184 mg/dl, leukocytes 245 /μL, with predominance of polymorphonuclear (67%), and
Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.
The patients evolution was favorable. The patient developed seizures with respiratory compromise that required orotracheal intubation.
The diagnosis was confirmed by liquid-based PCR acute meningitis due to sepsis associated with secondary bacteremia in blood cultures, which were extracted on arrival.
Antibiotic therapy was initiated with ampicillin and gentamicin, with favorable evolution, both infectious and neurological, without new seizures once in a hospital ward.
In turn, rombencephalitis and cerebral abscess were ruled out by magnetic resonance imaging.
As an incidence, the patient has partially reversible aminoglycosides ototoxicity at discharge.
Diagnosis Acute meningoencephalitis due to LisÃ©¥s syndromes in an immunocompetent patient.
Aminoglycaside ototoxicity
