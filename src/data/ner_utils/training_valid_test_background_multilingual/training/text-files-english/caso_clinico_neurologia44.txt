Anamnesis A 67-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of continuous headache located at the retroocular level and frontal irradiation, without accompanying vegetative symptoms, which made it difficult to rest at night.
In addition, the headache picture was progressively added diplopia the previous days.
She had a history of allergy to corticosteroids, hypertension, pulmonary and lymph node tuberculosis treated for 9 months and ischemic heart disease.
Physical examination revealed no abnormalities.
Neurological examination revealed a normal visual campimetry with limitation for the localization more important than adduction, with involvement of the left eye supra and infraduction, and mild dyschromatopsia.
A papilla with clear edges is described in the examination of the eye fundus.
The patient is evaluated by ophthalmology, describing these a mild alteration of macular epithelium, IOP 18 mmHg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or vasculitis.
▁Complementary tests are requested in the Emergency Department: • Blood analysis, which highlights ionogram with hyponatremia of 124 mmol/l and creatinine of 93 mmol/l, with normal formula and coagulation.
• Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities.
• Cranial computed tomography (CT) without signs of parenchymal abnormalities, bleeding, masses or ventriculomegaly.
The lumbar puncture yields 0 cells, glycorrhachia and proteinorrhachia within the normal range, and there are no observed in stain, gram-resistant acid bacilli or gram-resistant acid bacilli.
During hospitalization in the Neurology ward, the following were requested: • Analytical tests with immunophenotypic markers, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor and complement study, without alterations.
Positive ANA and c-ANCA were obtained for a single marker.
• Negative Bence-Jones Protein in urine.
• HIV serology and negative.
• Medium magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) reveals the presence of a thickening of the left sinus wall, with contrast uptake in the pachymeninge of the cranial fossa.
• Otorhinolaryngological evaluation: left septal dysmorphia, with bilateral free meatus, free sphenoet prescription and normal cavum.
• High-resolution chest CT: multiple subcentimetric nodular opacities were observed, which were already present in previous studies, but some new opacities were found that led to the reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
• abdominal CT scan without abnormalities.
• Pterygomaxillary fossa biopsy: it shows granulomatous material, fibrous tissue and inflammatory cells.
Diagnosis After neurological examination, the case was diagnosed as sinus syndrome.
Three hypotheses are proposed: • Tuberculous reactivation.
The patient had been correctly diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis and, since mycobacteria were not isolated, it was decided to extend the differential diagnosis to other granulomatous diseases.
• Neoformative process, which is ruled out by immunophenotypic markers and biopsy.
• Systemic inflammatory disease, which given the presence of c-ANCA-like antibodies, mild renal failure and sinus node involvement images (OSCE) extending to the ENT territory, leads to granulomatosis with polygeneanxy
However, the patient does not meet the classic criteria of Wegener's disease, although there is a strong suspicion of a limited form of it.
Treatment Given the history of tuberculosis and possible allergy to corticosteroids, it was decided not to initiate empirical treatment.
As the diagnostic approach is close to vasculitis, the possibility of performing a seizure with corticosteroids is suggested, but the patient reacts and headaches rebound, although dyschromia persists with conventional analgesia and dyspepsia.
The patient is discharged with good pain control, although diplopia persists in the binocular vision.
After 15 days, the patient consulted for petechial lesions in the extremities, presenting deterioration of the renal function figures, so a renal biopsy was performed, which suggested the presence of fibrinoid necrosis with no semilunar CT.
Treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone boluses was started, and given the pulmonary involvement, plasmapheresis and vein thrombosis were initiated.
After 3 weeks of treatment, clinical remission is achieved, ocular mobility is normal and not painful, and the patient is discharged home with outpatient controls.
Twelve months later, due to a viral respiratory infection complicated by immunosuppression and bacterial superinfection, the patient died in the Intensive Care Unit.
