A 43-year-old male patient, born in Santa Cruz (BAvia), who has been living in Spain for 15 years, smokes 15 packs/year, is a sporadic drinker.
Her personal history included neurocysticercosis diagnosed and treated in her country of origin in 2002 with two cycles of 21 days of albendazole (800 mg every 12 hours), without follow-up, and in treatment with phenytoin since.
He came to the Neurology Department from Primary Care with episodes of hemicraneal headache of one year duration, with a frequency of 2-3 episodes per month that resolved with total paraesthesia 5 minutes and a spontaneous anti-inflammatory analgesia, as well as a recovery.
She had risky sexual relations, as well as any other symptoms.
No significant findings were found in the examination by equipment and systems.
Symptoms were present from Neurology consultations, and the following complementary tests were requested: • complete blood count: normal in the three series.
Biochemistry: liver function, renal function and normal acute phase reactants.
• Microbiology: - Serology of HIV: negative; Serology of Taenia solium: Positive; Serology of Trypanosoma cruzi (Elisa IgG and IFI IgG): Positive and negative serology of granulochi: positive
- Mantoux test: negative.
• Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): cystic lesions with thick walls were observed, presenting a punctiform image inside them, hyperdense and without hyperoccipital diffusion in the left region, frontal, parietal restriction.
• Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, no condensations or effusions, no bone pathology.
These findings led the patient to Infectious Diseases consultations for treatment and follow-up.
Differential diagnosis of the patient's clinical features, epidemiological factors and the results of the tests obtained can raise the differential diagnosis between the following nosological entities: • Tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS).
Tuberculosis: CNS involvement in tuberculosis can occur in different ways.
For example, as a tuberculous meningitis, usually manifesting in a subacute form, which does not match the clinical picture of our patient.
However, it can also present as a tuberculoma, which is usually solid lesions (non-cystic) with perilesional edema, and is also a rare entity in immunocompetent patients.
• Cerebral abscess.
Symptoms of a bacterial brain abscess usually manifest as fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and a relatively acute onset of neck stiffness.
At MRI, the abscess appears as a hypointense lesion that captures ring contrast at T1.
In T2 it presents a central hyperintense area (pus)▁surrounded by a well-defined hypointense capsule, which in turn is edema.
• Cerebral hydatidosis.
CNS involvement can lead to seizures or intracranial hypertension, which would be compatible with our case, however serology for Echinococus spp.
It was negative.
• Chagas disease with central nervous system involvement.
The most common CNS involvement is in the form of a space-occupying mass, a pseudotumor or "chagoma", which can also manifest as acute meningoencephalitis, less frequently.
Our patient had a positive Chagas serology, however, the central nervous system involvement in this entity is mainly observed in patients with a high level of immunosuppression who underwent potent HIV/L infection with a count of 100 anti-CD4 lymphocytes.
• Neurosyphilis.
We found different forms of presentation of neurosyphilis, asymptomatic neurosyphilis (only alterations in CSF) and symptomatic neurosyphilis within which there is a progressive cerebral cord▁rigidity (myeloid symdrolysis), similar to cerebral palsy with cerebral palsy with cerebral palsy with cerebral palsy with cerebral palsy with cerebral palsy without cerebral palsy without
The clinical case presented here is not consistent with a neurosyphilis. However, the patient had a negative RPR pattern and a late treatment course for a positive syphilis IgG syphilis, compatible with syphilis.
Therefore, although clinically unlikely, it would be a diagnostic possibility that would have to try to rule out CSF analysis (CRFRV).
• Cerebral toxoplasmosis.
CNS involvement in toxoplasmosis involves the appearance of encephalitis and abscess formation.
The most frequent symptoms are headache and fever, which appear in half of the patients, in addition, as a consequence of the neurological damage, mental confusion and sensory-motor deficits arise.
It is usually seen in immunosuppressed patients with impaired cellular immunity (HIV with advanced immunosuppression, patients with malignancies and chemotherapy or solid organ transplant recipients).
These patients have almost all a positive serology for IgG and negative for specific IgM.
As we have already commented on our patient is immunocompetent, and also has a negative serology for toxoplasma, so it is a very unlikely diagnostic option.
• Cryptosis cerebri.
Cryptococcosis is one of the most frequent and severe fungal infections associated with HIV, acting as a predisposing factor the presence of CD4 lymphocyte count below 100 cells/μl.
In more than 75% of cases there is a subacute meningitis or meningoencephalitis with fever,▁malaise, few or no meningeal signs and headache.
In 10-15% of cases, space-occupying lesions, cryptomas, single or multiple, with enhancement or no enhancement, solid or ring-shaped, usually in the basal▁ganglia or the talus can appear.
• Non-infectious metastases from nodular lesions with peripheral CNS uptake (metastasis, lymphoma, primary tumour...).
• Neurocysticercosis.
Neurocysticercosis is the involvement of the CNS by the parasitic form of the larvae of Taenia solium, acting the human being as an intermediate host, who clinically courses with focal neurological epilepsy, intracranial hypertension and signs.
The findings depend on the larval stage, number and location.
Parenchymal involvement is the most common form, and cysts are located primarily in the cerebral cortex, presenting different evolutionary phases from viable cysts (with scolex) to the final evolutionary phase.
Positive serology and radiological imaging make this the most probable diagnosis.
The patients condition was assessed in the Infectious Diseases Clinic where he reported the same symptoms previously described and the results of the complementary tests requested by neurology were reviewed.
MRI images were evaluated by an expert radiologist and the results were described as compatible with active neurocysticercosis.
Oxy background examination was requested to rule out ocular involvement, establishing the diagnosis of active neurocysticercosis, since he had cystic lesions with scolex on MRI (absolute criteria for Tlium) and serology.
Feces were requested to rule out self-inoculation and were negative.
Regarding the serological pattern of syphilis (RPR negative, T. cruzi infection positive), lumbar puncture was proposed to the patient, rejecting this examination because she denied having sex with risk, and referred to benza intramuscular penicillin previous syphilis dose.
Regarding positive Chagas serology, the patient denied gastrointestinal symptoms, presented chest X-ray without cardiomegaly, echocardiography and electrocardiogram were requested, both normal, and Chagas' disease was negative, with the diagnosis of indeterminate disease.
Admission to the hospitalization ward for infectious diseases was indicated for combined treatment.
Albendazole 400 mg every 12 hours was prescribed for 4 weeks and praziquantel 600 mg 2 tablets were prescribed in the bedroom, 2 tablets in the bedroom, and 3 tablets in the meal for four weeks.
In addition, treatment with dexamethasone 2 mg every 12 hours was initiated, starting 24 hours before the start of antiparasitic therapy, and phenytoin was prescribed by levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours to avoid interactions.
After 48 hours of antiparasitic treatment, the patient developed two episodes of secondary generalized partial seizures with tongue bite and posterior amnesia, thus increasing the dose of levetiracetam to 1000 mg every 12 hours.
After 7 days of admission, without new complications, the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up.
The treatment was completed without incidents and with good tolerance to medication.
She didn't have any new seizures.
Brain MRI and serology for T. solium were requested 6 months after completion of treatment.
The MRI showed sertricial lesions without activity and T. solium was negative.
These results and the absence of neurological symptoms were assumed to cure neurocysticercosis.
Annual follow-up was indicated with serology of T. solium.
Once the treatment of neurocysticercosis was completed, outpatient treatment for Chagas disease was initiated with asymptomatic monitoring ECG with 15 mg/kg/day of ascending line, up to a total of 270 tablets, with Chagas disease being very well tolerated annually.
Final diagnosis • Active parenchymal neurocysticercosis.
• Chagas disease of unknown duration.
• Treated syphilis.
