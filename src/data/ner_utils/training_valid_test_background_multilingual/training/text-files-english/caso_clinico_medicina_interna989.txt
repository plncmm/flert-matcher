Among the causes of spinal cord necrosis, the infectious one was investigated because similar structures were observed in the aspirate study, since treatment with caspoline was initiated, which was subsequently withdrawn by negative panfungal PCR.
No neoplastic infiltrate was observed in the biopsy, ruling out malignant pathology, a CT scan was performed for extension study of a solid tumor that was negative.
Due to the persistence of the anti-catheterization only, previous analytical tests were carried out, showing that the LDH value is normal, indicating that spinal cord necrosis could be an acute process related to fluconazole and maintenance of drug levels.
