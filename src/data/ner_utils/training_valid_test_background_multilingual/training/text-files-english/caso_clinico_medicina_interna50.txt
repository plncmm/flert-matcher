We report the case of a 37-year-old woman with the only clinical history of anxiety-depressive syndrome treated with lorazepan and fluoxetine who consulted in the emergency department due to the onset, a week after suffering a chronicle
Cranial CT scan is performed, which is normal, and the patient is discharged.
But at home there is a progressive worsening of the condition, with a sensation of generalized numbness, inability to walk and diplopia, so she is admitted to the hospital ward.
After 24 hours of admission, the patient continues to deteriorate, with the appearance of intense sleepiness, disorientation, paresis bilateral (with ptosis and limitation of all eye movements) and tetraparesis predominantly affecting a patient with bilateral intensive care unit.
▁Complementary tests - complete blood count and biochemistry without alterations to highlight.
AntiNMDA and acetylcholine receptor negatives.
Anti-GQ1B antibodies were negative.
 CSF: normal biochemistry.
Enterovirus PCR, Herpes Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus, negative.
Baceral culture and negative culture.
AFB negative.
• Tac craneal: normal.
 Cranial MRI: normal.
 Control cranial MRI (performed 2 weeks after admission): no significant changes in trunk or cerebellum.
Both internal capsules show symmetric focal images of signal increase in Flair, without diffusion restriction , as well as other subcortical images at parietooccipital level of similar characteristics, of nonspecific character.
· cervical spine MRI: discrete protrusion posterior disc at C5-C6 and C6-C7 level. Normal spinal cord syndrome.
· Electrophysiological study: normal.
· Control electrophysiological study: with conductive, motor and F responses of both normal lower limbs.
EEG: slowed bioelectrical activity of medium voltage without other overlapping anomalies.
EMG simple fiber: normal study.
VEPs: normal study.
Calculation of VA of LE:1.
The patients evolution is favorable when compared to the previously described clinical manifestations.
Thus, when she returns to a conventional hospital ward, she is conscious and alert, with complete paresis and left ptosis, limitation of the horizontal bilateral and vertical gaze of the left eye, without nystagmus.
In addition, tetraparesis of 4/5 intensity in upper limbs and 3/5 in lower limbs, TOR something alive in upper limbs, weak patellar and conserved alveoli, indifferent right Babinski and plantar reflex.
On the following days, the patient continues to evolve favorably, with subsequent closure persistent superior stenosis, with no incidences, and progressive recovery of the motor deficit, returning to the position of ambulance, with slow vertical improvement of the gap.
Diagnosis Bickerstaff's encephalitis.
