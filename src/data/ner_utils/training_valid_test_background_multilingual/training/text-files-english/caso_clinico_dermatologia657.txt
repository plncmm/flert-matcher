A 40-year-old male, with no relevant clinical history, who regularly attends the outpatient clinic of the pubic gynecologic clinic for presenting very painful, pruritic lesions for a couple of months.
These lesions initially began as follicular▁papules with centrifugal growth and later evolved to form large plaques with raised edges and more intense coloration.
They were initially treated with corticosteroids and appeared to improve, but within a few weeks they became ill and therefore became worse in a sample of scaly lesions for bacterial culture and possible mycological cause.
The sample under study was spread in the usual media for bacteria, in Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and actidione.
Colonies of a filamentosa with a dermatophyte appearance grew ten days later.
When examining the mental component, tabicated hyphae, chlamydiosis with tapered shapes, abundant macroconidia were observed and grouped into clusters, and no microconidia.
The clinical picture presented by the patient, both by the description of the lesions and their evolution, seems to be a dermatophytosis.
Squamous scabs from the scraping of the lesions were grown in suitable media for the growth of dermatophytes such as Sabouraud agar, Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol test acid K.
The etiologic agent causing this dermatosis is the dermatophyte Epidermon floccosum, the main cause of tinea cruris, dermatoses suffered by the patient in this case.
The ideal antifungal agent for dermatophytosis is terbinafine, a fungicidal drug that binds strongly to▁keratin and fatty tissue and remains at high concentrations after cessation of treatment 250 mg component-4 for this reason.
