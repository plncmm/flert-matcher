We report the case of a 37-year-old male of African origin living in Spain for 10 years.
She presented with abdominal pain of 3 weeks duration, fever/febrile and increased abdominal▁perimeter.
On physical examination, the patient was in good general condition, with TA 110/70 mmHg, HR 110 spm and Ta 37.8 oC.
Painful abdomen to diffuse palpation, with non-stress ascites.
No other findings of interest.
Among the 67% non-fibrinolytic studies, leukocyte count was normal, except for GPT 62 U/l, CPK 1695 U/l, CRP 177 mg/l, VSG 100 mm/h, neutral hemoglobin of 114 g/l
Abdominal ultrasound showed homogeneous nodular hyperplasia and abundant free fluid with no other abnormalities.
Paracentesis was performed, whose biochemistry showed 2214 cells/mm3 (95% mononuclear), proteins 59 g/L, ADA 154 mU/mL, LDH 728 mU/mL, seroalbumin-ascitic gradient 8".
Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum smears and sputum culture were negative.
Normal chest and abdomen X-rays and intravenous c/c CT of abdomen showed diaphragmatic and mesentery lymphadenopathies, abundant intraperitoneal fluid, peritoneal enhancement and major omentum indigo carmine.
Differential diagnosis This is a patient of African origin, but taking into account that the most common cause of ascites is due to portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis (with 80% of frequency) multiple etiologies must be ruled out as well as other common causes
• Acute alcoholic hepatitis: it may be due to a baseline portal hypertension due to cirrhosis or transient portal venous obstruction, together with the associated malnutrition status.
• Acute liver failure: all causes of acute fulminant hepatitis can trigger ascites.
• Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (Bordd-Chiari syndrome): obstruction due to to tormbosis of at least 2 of the 3 suprahepatic veins.
• Heart failure.
Constrictive pericarditis: a decrease in venous return can trigger ascites due to congestion.
Hypoalbuminaemia: • Nephrotic syndrome.
• Protein-loss enteropathy.
• Severe malnutrition.
Peritoneal pathology: • Malignant ascites (gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer...): very difficult to diagnose when it is very similar to other diseases, the discussion will review its main characteristics.
• Infectious peritonitis: - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: it is of the utmost importance to rule out it in zyrotic patients with ascites.
- Secondary bacterial peritonitis (perforation in the setting of secondary infection), in addition to hollow viscera perforation, the characteristics of ascitic fluid would be different, with high cellularity and predominance of PMN,
- Peritoneal tuberculosis: given the origin and form of presentation, it is very likely, but other causes should be excluded.
- Fungal peritonitis: mainly patients on renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis, which is not our case.
- Parasites: exceptionally, but given the origin of the patient, they should be taken into account (hydatid disease, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis...), although it is very characteristic of ascites.
• Primary mesothelioma.
Systemic eosinophilias: Systemic pathological conditions with severe organ involvement that may cause hepatic failure such as hypereosinophilic syndromes, Churg-Strauss syndrome, etc.
They'd be lying in LA.
Inflammatory autoimmune disease/autoimmune autoimmune syndrome: It is necessary to rule out autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, which may progress to self-reported syndromes such as familial autoimmune disorders, periodic anti-TNF syndrome...
A high index of suspicion is required, ascites due to serositis is uncommon.
• Autoimmune diseases: SLE (uncommon), rheumatoid arthritis, chronic autoimmune hepatitis and cholestasis (primary biliary lithiasis and primary scerous cholangitis in the cirrhosis phase, etc.
other causes: Sarcoidosis (rare form of presentation), chylous ascites (liquid ascites secitis, colitis, predominant, ascites), ascites ascites (new stage), myx
After 14 days of admission, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with biopsies for culture and pathology.
The laparoscopic report reports massive adhesion, miliary▁granules in the parietal, visceral and omentum peritoneum, with a quantity of ascites, compatible with tuberculous peritonitis.
The pathology reports necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and the biopsy culture is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Lowenstein medium, without resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin, with positive PCR; the same liquid culture of centrifuged species shows negative PCR.
Treatment with 4 drugs and prednisone was initiated, with excellent evolution and resolution of symptoms.
Final diagnosis Tuberculous peritonitis.
