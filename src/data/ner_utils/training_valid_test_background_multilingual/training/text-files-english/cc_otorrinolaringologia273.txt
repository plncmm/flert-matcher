A 9-month-old boy presented with a fever of 48 hours onset.
In the last hours, the patient began with irritation and refusal to take the medication, as well as an increase in the left hemi-neck.
Treatment with oral cefotaxime for the last 48 hours.
As for the physical examination: Neurologically Irritate and cheek, no neck stiffness and negative meningeal signs Oropharynx and posterior pharyngeal contour left posterior pharyngeal enlargement with left midline neck displacement.
Analysis of leukocytosis with neutrophilia.
C-reactive protein 303 PCT 4.59 Urgent cervical CT (including images) was requested.
Left retropharyngeal abscess with contiguous inflammatory changes in the neighborhood spaces with mild airway compromise and no mediastinal extension.
Hospital admission was decided for intravenous antibiotics (cefotaxime and clindamycin) and urgent surgical drainage (surgery will be explained).
A sample was collected for culture of purulent content where Streptococcus pyogenes sensitive to penicillin grew. After one week of evolution, the patient progressed favorably and was asymptomatic because of the fact that the cervical aponeurosis was previously discharged.
It extends from the skull base to the▁mediastinum posterior to the T3 level.
It is limited between the constrictor muscles of the pharynx and the prestressed muscles.
The "dangerous" space goes behind the retropharyngeal space and is the way to disseminate infectious or tumoral processes to the▁mediastinum.
The most dangerous of this is its possible rapid spread to the▁mediastinum, but it acts with a rapid action as well as its proximity to the upper airway.
Therefore, it is important to make an early diagnosis in order to establish treatment as soon as possible, including in most cases surgical intervention as well as intravenous antibiotic treatment that covers the most frequently causative microorganisms, and directed against the culture and culture.
