A 50-year-old woman with a history of seizures and hypercholesterolemia, in close contact with dogs and cats at home, had no other relevant medical history.
He was admitted in March 2019 with a history of intense cough without expectoration, fever and chest pain of mechanical characteristics of one week of evolution.
The physical examination and chest X-ray were anodyne; analytically called attention >50% with a total count of 14.000/Î¼L and IgE>5000 kUA/L (0-120).
Immunophenotype and peripheral blood morphology ruled out malignancy.
After antibiotic treatment, the patient was discharged and monitored in the clinic after the disappearance of the fever and partial improvement of cough, with persistence of costal pain, which was attributed to cough due to its characteristics.
The study was extended with serology, all negative except for suggestive signs of positive IgG process and CAT scan was performed with finding bilateral millimetric pulmonary opacities, some with atypical infectious glass halo.
Accompanying clinical manifestations, respiratory symptoms, epidemiology, serology and compatible imaging tests, a diagnosis of candidiasis was made.
Ophthalmology was requested to rule out ocular toxocariasis and specific treatment with albendazole 400mg every 12h for 5 days and prednisone 30mg for 5 days was initiated.
One month after the end of treatment, residual cough disappeared, as well as reduction of peripheral serum IgE levels.
With this, it was recommended to disassemble domestic animals.
Toxocariasis is a rare disease in our environment. It is caused by ingestion of eggs of the nematode Toxo canis or Toxocariasis cati, which usually infect dogs and cats.
