We report a case of disseminated Mycobacterium chela infection in chronic treatment in a 58-year-old woman. Among her personal history, the following stood out: – Diabetes Mellitus type II in treatment with vildagliptin 50mg/metformin 850mg – Chronic Kidney Disease
Secondary cardiomyopathy and LVEF 27% Actual disease: Presents multiple indurated nodular lesions with erythematous base on the medial face of the lesions, arms and upper trunk.
The skin lesions evolved to necrotic areas that were fistulated to the skin and suppurated. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, which was compatible with a neutrophilic lobular and septal pannylylylyllic lesion.
The cultures showed growth of aerobic and anaerobic species present in any organism.
The results of cultures for mycobacteria were negative.
The patient was admitted due to worsening of the lesions, with multiple suppurative erythematous maculopapular lesions with confluence of them and formation of plaques with a deep ulcer of borders not raised.
Biopsy of the lesions was repeated and collagen bands were observed.
Nine cultures of indurated lesions show growth of Mycobacterium colonies.
Chemistry sensitive in vitro to clarithromycin.
Treatment with clarithromycine was initiated e.v.
skin involvement gets worse until the infection spreads.
She was admitted to the ICU.
Finally, the patient died due to ventricular fibrillation during a dialysis session in the ICU.
