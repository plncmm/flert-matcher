A 21-year-old woman came to the emergency department with left facial and neck inflammation.
He had been seen eight days before in another emergency department with fever, cough and dyspnea and was diagnosed with COVID-19.
Despite the improvement of her respiratory symptoms, she presented a progressive unilateral inflammation in her face and neck, which caused subjective defective dental occlusion and trismus.
On physical examination, she complained of lack of appetite, but persistent fevers, pain in the molars or facial weakness.
The patient had normal vital signs and moderate swelling in the left cheek, preauricular and submandibular, without erythema, induration or fluctuation.
The intraoral examination was normal, without purulent secretion of the▁parotid duct, and normal occlusion.
The rest of the exploration was anodyne.
Analytical and diagnostic imaging results led to a differential diagnosis that included infectious▁parotitis, sialolithiasis, salivary gland abscess and neoplasia.
The leukocyte count 3.170/uL without▁lymphocytic colitis was notable.
A craniomaxillofacial CAT scan revealed inflammation and an asymmetric and diffuse enlargement of the left▁parotid gland, without obstruction, mass or abscess in the▁parotid duct, accumulation of fluid periparotid perimandibular distended spaces.
The otorhinolaryngology team was consulted due to the extension of fluid in the adjacent anatomical spaces.
Pathologic examination revealed a more consistent pattern with acute infectious▁parotitis without complications.
Its defective occlusion sensation was attributed to inflammation around its masticatory muscles.
A regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed to treat a possible concomitant bacterial parotiditis. He was advised to apply warm▁compresses, massages in the gland, and use sialogogues.
