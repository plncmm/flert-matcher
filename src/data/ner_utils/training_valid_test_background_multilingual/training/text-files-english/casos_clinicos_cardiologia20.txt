A 43-year-old male, with no relevant clinical history, who 2 months before diagnosis began with a subacute clinical picture of a maximum fever of 39 Â°C, predominantly in the evening, pain, inflammation and functional impotence in the left hand.
On physical examination, the patient presented with pain in the first place, as well as inflammatory signs at the diastolic arch level, second, third, fourth and fifth degree of auscultation in all right lobes and left ankle with painful limitation of mobility.
The rest of the examination was normal.
Analytically, the following stood out: leukocytosis (16,000) with neutrophilia (VSG), 52 mm/h, and CRP, 4.6 mg/dl.
Hemostasis and biochemistry were normal.
In the immunological study, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, immunoglobulins and complement were negative, as well as serology for viruses and bacteria.
Blood cultures were performed after the first febrile peak and before the beginning of antibiotic therapy, which were positive for Enterococcus faecalis.
The chest X-ray showed mild bilateral pleural effusion and echocardiography showed severe aortic regurgitation with thickening of the valve leaflets.
With the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis caused by E. faecalis, intravenous antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin was initiated, with progressive improvement of the articular symptoms and fever and imaging findings, until the patient remained asymptomatic.
