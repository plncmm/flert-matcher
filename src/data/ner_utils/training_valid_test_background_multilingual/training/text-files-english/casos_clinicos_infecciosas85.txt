January 2018.
A 45-year-old woman with no known drug allergies.
A personal history of chronic venous insufficiency, glossitis in the right upper limb, one month ago, resolved after antibiotic treatment.
Surgery was performed to treat endometriosis.
She does not undergo routine home treatment.
Not vaccinated against influenza.
He came to the emergency department with fever up to 39oC, thiram and chills.
It was associated with cough with initial whitish expectoration of 5 days of evolution that worsens until▁frank hemoptysis.
Upon arrival, the patient had poor general condition, was conscious, oriented, cooperative, tachypnea using accessory muscles (34▁rpm) with basal oxygen saturation 80% without intake, TA 70/45 mmHg and temperature 38a
Upon cardiac auscultation, tachyrrhythmic tones at 150 bpm without audible murmurs were observed.
Upon pulmonary auscultation, there were secretion sounds up to the upper fields and bi-ventilation.
Abdomen, anodinous.
Lower limbs showed no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Analyses revealed impaired renal function (creatinine 1.64 mg/dl), mild hepatic enzyme abnormalities, CRP 342 mg/L, lactic acid 55.5 mg/dl with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.5 mg defective platelets 7,17, bicarbonate)
Chest X-ray showed left basal alveolointerstitial infiltrate with associated pleural effusion.
Hemodynamic instability of the patient was diagnosed with urinary incontinence and ICU for ventilatory support and intensive fluid therapy, requiring high doses of orotracheal intubation (orotracheal adrenaline and noradrenaline) for hemodynamic control, with very poor peripheral perfusion
Differential diagnosis We found septic shock of respiratory origin in the context of severe community-acquired pneumonia NSIP V with a qSOFA of 2 and SOFA of 7.
Since the patient is immunocompetent, we could rule out a priori that causative organisms could be colitis or protozoo, since they would be expected germs in immunocompromised patients1.
We must think of bacterial or viral origin taking into account the time we met.
The clinical presentation of the case with fever with thyritone and chills, acute onset Staphylococcus or well-defined alveolar infiltrate in the chest plate indicates typical bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae aspiration (first cause to be considered), Haemophilus influenzae
However, the typical presentation does not always correspond to typical bacteria, so we would have to include bacteria a (present intrinsic beta resistance) as Legs and traditional gram staining techniques do not grow or grow beta blockers.
(discharged initially for not being in a plausible epidemiological context), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci (key epidemiological factor of contact) and Coxiella burni with birds.
As for the plausible viruses, it would be necessary to take into account Influenza A and B, since we are in full seasonal sprout, Rhinovirus, Matrix Support virus, Adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.
The patient had no significant comorbidity. She had only undergone a small antibiotic cycle one month before due to resistant microorganisms in the upper limb and had not had contact with the health system, nor had she been subjected to any nosocomial intervention.
The patients evolution was very torpid and required intensive care unit infusion of high doses of vasoconstrictor and mechanical ventilation for 15 days.
The first microbiological results were: negative urine culture, negative urine pneumococcal antigen, positive influenza A RNA and negative influenza B RNA.
On the second day of admission they reported from microbiology, preliminarily, the growth in the culture of bronchial aspirate and in two hemocultives of Gram positive chain▁cocci that were finally identified as Streptococcus pyogenes (group A).
Empirical treatment was initiated with meropentamivir and, after microbiological results, clindamycin and meropentamivir were administered.
On the tenth day of admission to the ICU, antibiotic therapy was withdrawn due to a good evolution of the patient, although he maintained invasive ventilatory support.
During her stay in the ICU she presented infectious complications related to her admission to the ICU, which should be highlighted respiratory overinfection due to dry hands and dry hands, and the use of Pseudomonas aeruginosa overgrowth associated with necrosis secondary to admission.
At the same time, in the same week, two new cases of Streptococcus pyogenes pneumonia are diagnosed, isolated in hemocultives and bronchial aspirate.
Both cases were severe, requiring one of them to be admitted to the ICU, dying a few hours after admission due to multiple organ failure.
The other case was successfully managed in an infectious disease ward after starting antibiotic therapy directed in the first 24 hours by early growth in the blood cultures.
Because of the low incidence of this entity as community-acquired pneumonia, we sequenced all strains with agreement of all of them.
An epidemiological study was carried out by the Preventive Medicine of our hospital when broth was suspected, without identifying common factors that interrelated the cases.
Final diagnosis: Gestational infection complicated with septic shock due to severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.
