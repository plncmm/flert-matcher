White man, of peasant occupation, 57 years old, coming from Vertientes, Camagüey.
She was admitted on December 17, 2009 at the "Manuel Ascunce Domenech" Provincial Hospital of Camagüey, with presumptive diagnosis of infectious endocarditis by Brucella and moderate aortic insufficiency.
She came to the day care center with a fever of 38.0-38.5 oC for 4 months and generally nighttime, accompanied by sweating; chills dyspnea; joint pains, marked asthenia back;
Three previous admissions for a chronic febrile syndrome, with more than 9 months of evolution, with an initial diagnosis of endocarditis due to rheumatic fever, were observed. The patient underwent medical examinations with various antimicrobials, but did not improve.
The possibility of other causes of endocarditis was ruled out.
Among those who sought treatment for brucellosis, slow serology was indicated, but due to non-availability of endocarditis, such tests were performed until January 2010, when the disease was diagnosed with high serologic titers.
Epidemiological background: the patient has been living in a rural area for years in direct contact with cattle and pigs, handles animal deliveries, often eats milk and dairy products; has a history of wounds and microtrauma in his own hands.
Its farm collated with another cattle affected by brucellosis (statistical reports obtained from the Institute of Veterinary Medicine of Camagüey, 2010).
Positive findings on physical examination: — Cardiovascular system: heart sounds of good tone, no third or fourth sound, systolic murmur II/IV in the second right intercostal space, irradiating to the vessels of the neck.
— Terms of office: 120
— Heart rate: 68 per minute.
— Echocardiogram: vegetations in the aortic valve.
— Anteroposterior and lateral chest X-ray: no lesions are observed.

— Hemoculture in search of brucellosis: no bacterial isolation.
— Serology: Rose Bengal test: ++++; 2 mercaptoethanol: positive.
• Slow serology for Brucella (serum agglutination in tubes): 1:320 dilution.
The patient received treatment based on: 100 aminoglycosides markedly improved per gentamycin (ampulla 80 mg/2 mL) 2 ampulla every 12 h + amikacin (bulboos 500 mg/2 mL)
She was discharged with a diagnosis of infectious endocarditis due to Brucella and moderate aortic insufficiency, with improved evolution, at 30 days of hospital stay and follow-up of valve disease by internal medicine, cardiology and epidemiology consultation.
