An elderly patient with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, peripheral arteriopathy and chronic renal failure was admitted to the intensive care unit in the spring of 2020 with acute dyspnea.
One week before, the patient had experienced some tiredness, fever and dyspnea, which did not improve after treatment with cefpodoxime at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for 5 days.
A chest CT scan revealed multiple bilateral ground glass opacities with subpleural condensation.
A RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal smear confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.
One day after hospital admission, the patient developed an erythematous and scaly periumbilical spot with rapid progression of other desquamative plaques digitized on the sides of the trunk and thighs.
Some injuries to the arms, shoulders and back were▁papular.
The typed papulosquamous eruption was clinically similar to pityriasis rosea.
A skin biopsy of the left shoulder revealed foci of spongiosis with focal▁epidermal parakeratosis and a few spongy vesicles with sets of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells.
Moderate▁lymphocytic infiltrate was observed in the superficial dermis, associated with dermal papillary oedema.
We performed a RT-PCR test in a fresh skin biopsy sample and the result was negative for SARS-CoV-2.
The results of the blood tests, which included serological tests for HIV, treponemal and non-treponemal antigen tests and PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, were negative, while the results of the logB-PCR indicative of viral load were negative (4.610
Serum markers indicated reactivation and ruled out acute mononucleosis.
The skin exanthema resolved spontaneously within one week.
The patient died of disease associated with COVID-19.
