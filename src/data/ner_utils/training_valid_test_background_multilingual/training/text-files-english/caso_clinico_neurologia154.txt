A 57-year-old patient with a history of irregular urination, smoking 2 packs a day, progressive cognitive drinker with recurrent vomiting and▁daytime dyskinesias, who was admitted for a period of two weeks due to progressive vomiting.
Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 197/121 mmHg.
Aspect of carelessness and cachectic.
Heart attack without murmurs
Pulmonary consolidation with normoventilation.
Neurological presentation: Glasgow 4-5-6.
▁Right hemianopsia.
▁Right central facial paresis.
Normal force.
Skin and indifferent tissue.
Discrete right dysmetria.
Normal tactile viability with right extinction.
Gait was defined as severe ataxia that allowed sitting.
Additional tests • Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 85 bpm.
• Blood analysis: vitamin B12 178 pg/ml (low limitis), total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, LDL 170 IU/l, GGT 260 IU/l, with rest of normal biochemistry.
A normal blood count.
VSG 37 mm.
Tumor markers: GI monitor 76.2, NSE 143.8.
• Chest X-ray: global cardiomegaly and aortic elongation, with elevated right hemidiaphragm.
• Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): multiple cystic lesions of variable size scattered throughout the brain parenchyma, with a higher level of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all the powers of the protein component without enhancement only after the injection.
In addition, a right parieto-occipital mass is observed, with abundant vasogenic edema, foci of intratumoral bleeding and irregular enhancement after intravenous contrast administration, which does not seem to be related to those previously described.
Findings consistent with multiple metastases of some type of adenocarcinoma▁coinciding with a tumor suggestive of high-grade glial tumor.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple cystic lesions of variable size scattered throughout the brain parenchyma, and a parieto-occipital mass with bleeding vasogenic edema and foci of foci of malignancy.
• Blood culture: negative.
• Transthoracic echocardiography: within normal limits, with no signs of endocarditis.
• Serologies: negative for HIV, you, Brucella, Borrelia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cysticercosis, Toxoplasma and hydatidosis.
• Toco-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT): bronchopulmonary carcinoma with lobulated tumor mass 66 x 80 x 60 mm encompassing the lower lobe of the right lung and the left▁mediastinum lobe on the left▁mediastinum with the mucus.
Subcarine and prevascular adenopathies, upper and lower right paratraquals.
Bilateral and diffuse emphysema with paraseptal bullae (predominantly in the upper lobes).
Liver with multiple hypodense lesions cystic appearance in both lobes.
Bilateral adrenal metastases.
L5 bilateral spondylose with degenerative disc disease L5-S1.
The computed tomography scan of the chest revealed a lobulated tumor mass of 66 x 80 x 60 mm in the lower lobe of the right lung, the intermediate bronchus of the left lung and the middle lobe of the right▁mediastinum impmide with basal ur.
• Fibrobronchoscopy: macroscopic diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma with biopsy.
• Biopsy: small cell undifferentiated carcinoma.
In the▁immunohistochemical study, tumor cells express Ck AE1/AE3, TTF1, and weakly▁chromogranin and synaptophysin.
Initially, the multiple cystiform images disseminated by the cerebral parenchyma raised doubts with possible infectious pathology of the CNS, ruled out with the negativity of serology, the negativity of the permanent echocardiographic study, and the absence of fever.
Once the elevation of the right diaphragm was studied with CT and the pathological anatomy of the lung neoplasia was performed, these lesions were assumed to be metastases of a grade IV lung carcinoma with metastases at multiple levels.
Given the advanced stage of lung cancer and the situation of the patient, performing a brain biopsy is discouraged.
Due to the absence of pathological anatomy of the right parieto-occipital lesion, we can only state in relation to its morphological aspect in brain MRI that was suggestive of a high-grade glial primary tumor.
Thus, the final diagnosis was synchronous lesions: • Undifferentiated small cell lung carcinoma stage IV, with multiple brain metastases.
• Brain injury suggestive of high-grade glioma with symptoms of intracranial hypertension.
Treatment Dexamethasone was started to reduce perilesional edema and, according to the decision of the Tumor Committee, a confirmatory biopsy of the lung carcinoma was obtained to start holocrane radiotherapy.
The patients neurological deficits hardly improved during his stay in the ward.
She had insomnia and agitation on repeated occasions.
Two weeks later, the patient was discharged from the hospital under observation of his family and support from Palliative Care.
