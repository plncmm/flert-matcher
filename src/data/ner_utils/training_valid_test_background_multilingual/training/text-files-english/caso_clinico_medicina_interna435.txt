A 44-year-old male with no known drug allergies or other relevant backgrounds except for one month history of epigastric pain episodes and his primary care physician requested a positive alienation test.
She has been treated for two days with erradication for H. pylori.
The patient was seen in the emergency room due to asthenia and syncope of one week onset and two episodes of dysarthria lasting about 5-10 minutes.
He did not report fever or other accompanying symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented in the 3⁄4n, good general condition, cardiopulmonary auscultation without findings, as well as abdominal, lower limbs and neurological examination.
Blood tests revealed creatinine 1.38 mg/dL, hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL, platelets 9000/uL, leukocytes 7200/uL and neutrophils 71.2%.
ECG and chest X-ray showed no apparent findings.
We decided to admit the patient and started corticoid treatment with bicitretin a study (anemia and thrombopenia) and acute renal failure.
The following stand out in the plant analysis: total bilirubin 1.61 mg/dl, indirect bilirubin 1.43 mg/dl, haptoglobin < 1.61 mg/L, L indirect bilirubin test 2365 ng direct/mlDl and negative bilirubin ≥ 11
In the peripheral blood smear, 8 to 10 schistocytes were observed per field (see enclosed image).
Elevated total bilirubin, excessive total bilirubin, very decreased haptoglobin, elevated erythrocytes and negative direct Coombs test were diagnosed as micropathic hemolytic anemia.
In addition to the above, the elevation of creatinine, which did not present previously, and the neurological symptoms (syncotic trophotic and episodes of dysarthria) were found in a case of thrombocytopenic purpura.
We contacted our reference hospital for transfer and initiation of treatment with plasmapheresis.
