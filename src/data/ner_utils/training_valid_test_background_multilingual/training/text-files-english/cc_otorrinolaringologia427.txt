We report the case of a 10-year-old female patient who came to the emergency department with fever of 48 hours of evolution, vomiting, headache and right▁orbital inflammation with fever and proptosis.
On CT, right pansinusitis and superolateral intraorbital abscess were observed, so IV antibiotic was administered and Maxillofacial Surgery performed▁orbital drainage via external approach.
S. intermedius and Moraxella osloensis were isolated in culture.
The evolution was not good and the patient continued to present▁orbital inflammation, fever and vomiting.
A new CT scan showed persistent pansinusitis, a new superomedial▁orbital abscess and a frontotemporal subdural empyema.
Endoscopic drainage of the paranasal sinuses and medial orbita was then performed, and Neurosurgery performed open drainage of the empyema.
Despite the interventions, 12h later, a medial▁orbital abscess was again observed on CT, which was again operated by Maxillofacial Surgery.
Parvic seizure was isolated in cultured subdural empyema, commensal anaerobically from the oral cavity.
The evolution was slow during 50 days of admission, in which he presented candidemia, leucopenia and hypocomplementemia.
Numerous control MRIs were performed until complete resolution was observed.
In subsequent revisions persistent immune alterations were ruled out.
Six months later, the patient presented with mild ptosis vulgaris as a sequel.
Our patient was immunocompetent and healthy, and from a very early stage presented headache and vomiting.
Cultures showed a polymicrobial infection, present in more than half of these patients, and with the usual combination of Gram + as staphylococci and streptococcus together with anaerobic bacteria.
