A 56-year-old woman was followed up in our severe asthma unit because of severe eosinophilic asthma of late onset with bronchiectasis and who did not meet the criteria for mixed asthma and COPD syndrome.
Her asthma was controlled with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, montelukast, ipratropium and benralizumab.
On March 8, she came to the emergency department with a 24-hour episode of fever, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnoea and sputum paracoccidioidomycosis.
Physical examination showed no wheezing.
Additional tests revealed a unilobular opacity in the right lung, a slightly elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase values, and a positive PCR result for SARS-CoV-2.
The patient was given 500 mg of levofloxacin for 14 days as well as systemic corticosteroids (1 mg/kg) due to sputum, and in this case the patient had no history of hypoxemia/hypoxaemia due to lopinavir/ritonavir.
The patient was discharged on the fourth day of admission, considering her clinically stable condition, which remained without the need for oral corticosteroids.
One week later, the patient was asymptomatic.
Four family members also had COVID-19.
