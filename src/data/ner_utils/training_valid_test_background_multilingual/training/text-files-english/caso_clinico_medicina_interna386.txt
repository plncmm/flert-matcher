A 74-year-old man with no relevant personal history was referred to the emergency department for suspected severe allergic reaction.
The patient began two hours after fish intake, with pruritus and edema in both hands, followed by facial edema and nausea.
After admission to the emergency department, the patient was treated with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and bronchodilators. Physical examination showed no abnormalities except generalized erythema refractory depression.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytes 21.4x109/L (neutrophils 18.9), lactic acid 4.7mmol/L, pCO2 in venous blood 38, bicarbonate in venous blood 20, procalcitonin up to 0.6 days).
Given the suspicion of allergic reaction due to anisakiasis, IgE antibodies against Anisakis (28.70kU/L) and gastroscopy were requested, showing parasitic structures compatible with Anisakis, confirming the diagnosis.
