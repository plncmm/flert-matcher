A 72-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus of twelve years duration, treated with a metformin tablet 850 mg daily, mild plaque psoriasis, ex-smoker of about 15 years of evolution with confirmed toxic allergy.
Natural from Colombia, retired, worked as a farmer in Colombia and England, to later work in the pharmaceutical industry in England.
From 2014 retired and refined in Dorcal (Granada),▁dedicating most of his time to travel through different countries, having visited in the last year and Thailand, South Africa.
In the last three months, he traveled by Central Colombia to the United States, with a few weeks stay in New York where he visited rural and forestry areas, returning later to Spain.
He had suffered some kind of bites, although some of his excursion companions in New York had suffered tick bites.
He indicated unprotected heterosexual sporadic relationships during his trips.
He also claimed to have gone to a zone of thermal waters outdoors in the area near his village in the days after the return of the last voyage.
He had not received any vaccination or chemoprophylaxis prior to his travel.
Five days after returning to Spain from New York, she began with a flu-like illness with feverish sensation, intense asthenia and generalized arthromyalgias of at least one week of evolution, initially without affecting her fluctuating character.
During the 48 hours prior to the emergency department visit, she presented fever peak 39oC with sweating with profuse cough and cold, which was accompanied by general▁malaise and pleuritic pain in the left submammary region,
In the last weeks, the patient reported anorexia and unquantified weight loss.
In the anamnesis by organs and devices, he denied any other symptoms.
He had visited his family doctor in the previous days for this clinic, basic laboratory tests and a Mantoux test, but he did not find relevant findings to conjunctival examination, emergency room, and finally referred to the patient with conjunctival infection
Upon arrival to the emergency room, he had a fever of 39oC with a clear feeling of prostration and general▁malaise despite the preserved hemodynamic parameters.
The patient presented with palpable cutaneous psoriasis without lesions (except occipital plaque) or adenopathies.
The pharyngeal sinus examination was unremarkable.
On cardiorespiratory auscultation, hypophonesis was present in both apexes.
Abdominal examination showed no organomegaly, and extremities without skin lesions or other relevant data.
▁Complementary tests performed in the emergency room showed mild elevation of total bilirubin in 1.66 mg/dL, with normal direct bilirubin and transaminase levels, as well as elevated C-reactive protein in mg/mL and procalcitonin.
Ferritin levels were 3313 ng/mL with iron and transfered to the lower limit of normality, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertriglyceridemia mg/dL, normal lipid profile, and normal leukocytes (white blood cell count), normal leukocyte count (white blood count) and white blood cell count with 819) and poor
Serologies extracted in the Emergency Room for hepatotropic, HIV and syphilis viruses were negative.
Urocultive and hemocultive negative.
A single shot of feces, negative.
A peripheral blood smear was requested, which reported two compatible forms with hypersensitivity antigen, for which thick smear, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) were performed.
The chest X-ray and electrocardiogram showed no data of interest.
With the results of these tests and given the general condition of the patient, it was decided to enter the unit of Infectious Diseases of our hospital, with the diagnosis of fever of intermediate duration, bi-occurrence with hyperferritinemia.
Differential diagnosis To make the differential diagnosis we will focus on fever as a guide sign, with the peculiarity of appearing in a patient with a recent trip abroad, so that will become especially interesting imported pathology.
Although the study of fever in a patient after a trip abroad includes non-infectious causes, in our case, we assume this etiology as the most likely cause of the clinical picture due to its evolution, initial complementary tests and the clear chronological relationship.
It is mandatory to include pathologies common to any traveler in the differential diagnosis, and some of them especially if risky activities have been performed, such as our patient.
Given the wide range of infectious causes that could be taken into account in our case, it was decided to list possible etiologies, according to the North zones visited by the patient in the last weeks-months: Colombia.
Thus, it stands out: 1.
Colombia: hepatitis A and Bbes, dengue fever, syphilis, leishmaniasis, amebiasis and parasitosis, mainly malaria and baiosis.
2.
USA
Lyra disease called nontuberculosis ( Lyna disease), acquired by Hantavirus infection due to dengue fever, was also recognized as a bacillosis due to this illness, and its carriers were also recognized as a common diseases.
Focusing on the details of our case, above all patients coming from endemic tropical areas with fever and our main bisexual was diagnosed with a blood smear or thick, as in case of dementia.
The other imported intraerythrocytic parasitosis to be considered, and with morphology similar to malaria in certain stages of its biological cycle, would be babesiosis.
In addition, it is associated with similar risk factors, with sometimes overlapping epidemiological distribution, and particularly in our case, linked to geographical areas where our patient was present in the weeks and months before.
Finally, we believe that in addition to the possible infectious etiology, our case should include a specific situs in situs invertebrates and triglycerides in the differential diagnosis: hemophagocytic syndrome, since it is a patient with fever,
This will force us to request a puncture aspiration of bone marrow (PAMO).
During admission, the patient was initially treated with antipyretics without empirical antibiotic therapy due to clinical and hemodynamic stability, while waiting for additional tests.
The study was completed with analytical tests with basic autoimmunity (negative and serologies for parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-C, all of them negative, Borrelia virus.
In addition to hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia was found with other normal lipid profile.
Abdominal ultrasound was requested, which reported hepatic steatosis and moderate stenosis, without other lesions.
The study was also extended with a negative urine antigenuria for Leishmania.
Finally, the Hematology service was consulted to assess the performance of a PAMO, with the following report: cell aspirate with monocytes and slight dysgranulopoiesis, without observing an increase in the number of macrophages.
This study was completed with negative PCR for Leishmania in bone marrow.
a fifth hour of clinical improvement was observed in every patient treated conservatively with intraerythrocit drugs, and after ruling out malaria with thick blood smears, PCR and antigen, a possible babes study was performed at the Instituto de Salud 750 mg
In the subsequent consultation, this improvement was verified, showing the asymptomatic patient with afferent afecction, with normalization of the levels of hemoglobin and platelets in the blood count and decrease of CRP, ferritin and triglycerides in the last analytical.
The report was received from the Carlos III Health Institute, with positive IgG result by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) for Babesia spp.
Final diagnosis Imported Babesiosis from Northwestern Spain patient with recent travel.
