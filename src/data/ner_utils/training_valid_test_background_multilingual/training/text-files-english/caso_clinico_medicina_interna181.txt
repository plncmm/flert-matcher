complementary iron deficiency was observed in 1.A iron deficiency anemia (Hemoglobin 4.5 g/dL, MCV 59 fL, MCH 15 pg/cell, serum hemoglobin 10 μg/dL and chest x-ray 2.10 ng/dL).
Initially, the study was expanded with: - Gastrocoscopic: Infectious▁esophagitis due to C. albicans (microbial confirmation) and severe intrathoracic transcardiac echocardiography with partial systolic collapse of the right pericardium.
A comprehensive serological screening - antinuclear antibody (ANA) 1.6(1.0), negative for other autoimmunity, was performed.
- Pericardial fluid study: Aspecto seropositivity compatible with▁exudate
Bacteriological study, including mycobacteria, and negative pathological anatomy.
- Mantoux: positive, with no evidence of mycobacterial infection (putum, pericardial gastric juice), non-small cell TAC or high-density cervical-pelvic areas suggest: right, heterogeneous,
Calcified nodule in the right thyroid lobe.
- Catheterization site in blood and urine 24 hours: Normal - Bilateral mammography: No significant changes - PET-CT:▁Right laterocervical lymph node mapping with moderate increase in metabolism.
The patient underwent an intra-operative follicular papillary thyroid carcinoma biopsy. A total thyroidectomy (multicentric papillary thyroid carcinoma) and central cervical neck dissection were performed.
