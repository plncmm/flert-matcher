Personal history The patient had no known medical allergies, cardiovascular risk factors or medical or surgical history of interest.
He had been living in Cameroon for two months and did not perform malaria chemoprophylaxis correctly.
Current illness Twelve days after Camerún returns, she began an episode of general▁malaise, along with feverish syndrome thermo-metalted (up to 40oC) predominantly in the evening, accompanied by profess sweating.
The patient also presented arthromyalgias and nausea.
She had no other accompanying symptoms of interest.
Physical oxygen saturation of 95% had regular general state, conscious and oriented, mucocutaneous, normohydrated, eupneic at rest, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, feverish, blood pressure saturation of 39oC
Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation revealed no abnormalities.
Abdominal palpation revealed no masses, organomegaly, or tender points on superficial and deep palpation.
Bilateral renal percussion was negative.
There were no edemas or signs of deep venous thrombosis in the extremities and the neurological examination was normal.
▁Complementary leukocyte count (APC) at admission revealed neutrophil count (93.2%; lymphocyte count 164; 1.3% monocytes; 0.5%▁eosinophils; 8 g/μL; hematocrit 4,920,000/μL);CM
Two days after admission, the results were: hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL; hematocrit 32.7%; platelets 48,000/μL.
The most important biochemical determinations were ALT 183 U/L; AST 157 U/L; LDH 862 U/L; total bilirubin 3.03 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 2.16 mg/dL.
The remaining parameters were within normal limits, including the proteinogram.
The coagulation study at admission showed prothrombin activity of 100% and at two days of admission 60%.
The urine sediment, three hemocultives, the urocultive and the chest X-ray were normal or negative.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a normal liver and a slight enlargement.
The markers of hepatitis were: hepatitis C negative; hepatitis B HBs antigen negative; anti-HBs positive antibodies, anti-HBc positive antibodies.
In the bone marrow aspirate few phenomena of hemagofagocytosis were observed.
Reticular and macrophage cells were observed in a somewhat high amount together with a giant cell.
Diagnostic test Intraerythrocytic plaques were observed in the peripheral blood extension.
Clinical judgement Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
The patients condition was managed with quinine sulfate (650 mg every 8 hours) and amoxicillin (100 mg every 12 hours) for one week.
Initially, the patient developed torpid plaque, with decreased prothrombin activity that required vitamin K and progressive decrease in platelet count, requiring intravenous gammaglobulin treatment.
Subsequently, the fever disappeared, the figures previously described normalized and therefore the patient was discharged.
The patient was seen in the outpatient clinic after two months and was asymptomatic.
