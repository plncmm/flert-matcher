This is a 27-year-old male, without known drug allergies, professional butcher, who has as antecedent agammaglobulinemia of Bruton diagnosed at 4 months of age, with intravenous immunoglobulin 4 weeks of age, in 2015
She suffered a presyncopal episode in relation to immunoglobulin infusion.
You have not completed a vaccination schedule.
No other relevant background.
Nine days prior to admission, the patient complained of pain in the left shoulder and dysthermic sensation.
After visiting the outpatient clinic, the patient was discharged twice with a diagnosis of contracture of silence.
A week later the patient developed a fever of 38o, together with inflammation and increased local temperature at the cervical level. At the arrival site, the patient was diagnosed with TA4 at the left cervical auscultation.
Blood count showed 17000 leukocytes/mm3 with 68% neutrophils, Hb 12.2 g/dl and blood biochemistry CRP 56.5 mg/l, which subsequently increased to 95.7mg/l.
A plain chest X-ray was normal, a clavicular CT scan showed inflammatory signs at the level of the clavicular joint, and the study was completed with a bone scan that showed increased level of bone activity. the sealant activity.
A puncture of the SCA was performed, obtaining a serosanguinolent fluid sent for culture.
Differential diagnosis We present an immunosuppressed patient with a clinical syndrome consisting of left ear pain accompanied by fever and inflammatory signs in SCA.
Despite the history of hyperexhibition of the upper left limb trauma, it would be reasonably ruled out.
The differential diagnosis, therefore, would focus on an arthritic-to-clavicular framework as the first option; and given the presence of infection data, we would consider infectious etiology in the first place.
Other conditions that should be ruled out are: • Systemic autoimmune diseases: Joint involvement in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus usually has a polyarticular and symmetrical distribution, which did not occur in our case.
In ankylosing spondyloarthritis, 14% of the cases have described clavicular joint involvement.
The absence of other more characteristic symptoms makes this cause unlikely.
Psoriatic arthritis usually presents with oligoarthritis, but the patient did not present cutaneous manifestations.
• Microcrystalline arthritis: although classically monoarticular, it usually affects the metatarsophalangeal joint (gota) or the knee (pseudogota).
• Reactive arthritis: the absence of previous infection and monoarticular involvement would rule out this entity, which manifests as peripheral oligoarthritis and minor oligoarthritis.
The main microorganisms described as causes of SCA arthritis are: Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomona aeruginosa, Brucella melitensis and Escherichia coli.
Of these, Pseudomona aeruginosa has been associated with parenteral drug users, and Brucella melitensis, despite the patient's professional history, has been misdiagnosed in our country.
In cases of hypogammaglobulinemia, unusual etiologies such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Ureaplasma urealyticum should be considered.
Osteoarticular tuberculosis, which accounts for 10-25% of extrapulmonary TB, has been described in SCA arthritis, although it usually affects the axial skeleton (Pott's disease), followed by hip and hip.
Lyme disease is unlikely due to the absence of symptoms, the absence of erythema migrans and the patient did not respond to an endemic disease nor did he have any previous endemic disease activities.
Performing antibiotic therapy every 8 hours, the patient was discharged home with apparent cefadroxime and leukocytosis.
Subsequently, it was reported that macrolide resistant Campylobacter coli was isolated from hemocultives and with MIC for ciprofloxacin of 0.125 (cephalosporins were not tested); AEC culture was negative.
Treatment with ciprofloxacin (mg every 12 hours) is modified to achieve a total of 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy.
Final diagnosis Campylobacter coli Campyloclavicular arthritis in a patient with Brutons agammabulimemia.
