A 75-year-old man presented with fever, chills, and coughing, March 19, 2020.
Its cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension, obesity, ex-smoking and renal failure.
A test for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2 was positive, and a quarantine at home was advised; however, a worsening dyspnea required hospitalization.
In addition to cough, fever (38.7 °C) and low oxygen saturation (88% without oxygen), analytical tests showed high values of C-reactive protein (82 mg/m), myoglobin (836 mg/l), troponin Tultens.
The electrocardiogram revealed left anterior fascicular block and T wave inversion in aVL derivation.
Tests for other viruses (adenovirus; Coronaviridae 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43; human bocavirus; metaneumovirus−; rhinovirus/enterovirus4) were negative.
Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2 was confirmed in the laboratory.
Since troponin was increasing (191 ng/l), coronary angiography was performed on March 23, 2020, in which the left ventricular filling pressure was ruled out, with 14 mmHg in the left ventricle filling pressure.
An echocardiogram performed on the same day revealed normal activity of the LV and RV, with signs of concentric LV dilatation and without parietal motion abnormalities.
On March 24, 2020, a cardiac MRI was performed to evaluate a possible inflammatory myocardial lesion.
Due to dyspnea, cardiac MRI (Philips 1.5 Tesla) was performed in free breathing using basically single-dose sequences.
Normal activity of the LV and RV was observed, with no abnormalities in the regional parietal movement.
No focal fibrosis was detected with late gadolinium enhancement sequences.
T2-weighted images showed global edema as well as elevated T2 (56 ms, reference 48 § 3 ms) and T1 values (1.090 ms, reference 989 § 28 ms), which were suggestive of myocardial injury.
On March 26, 2020, an episode of hypoxemic respiratory failure (saturation 80%) required mechanical ventilation.
The patient improved and was extubated; cardiac▁biomarker values decreased progressively (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 631 ng/l, troponin 61 ng/l).
