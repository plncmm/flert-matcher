A 10-year-old girl diagnosed with rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma due to allergy to olive and grass pollens, and oral allergy syndrome with fruits and vegetables due to allergy to profilin.
He had previously undergone two years of sublingual immnunotherapy with pollen, which had to be suspended due to poor tolerance (e.g. respiratory stridor).
Subsequently, in our hospital, a new cycle of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy against pollens (olive and grasses) was started, with poor tolerance during induction in the form of episodes of sudden cough and non-pathological laryngeal stridor.
However, given the high suspicion of the existence of a psychogenic component involved in the clinical picture, it was decided to administer the following dose under surveillance in our Technical Area and in a single blind, placebo-controlled masked fashion.
After the placebo dose, the patient developed the same symptoms, which progressively subsided after the corresponding dose of immunotherapy.
With this, the psychogenic component was confirmed as the main responsible for the clinical picture, being able to continue with immunotherapy and also to withdraw all the chronic treatment related to its cough.
We report the case of a patient who presented with immediate cough and stridor as a reaction by immunotherapy and who could continue treatment without incidents after objectifying the psychogenic origin of this reaction.
