A 42-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a recent diagnosis of metastatic clear cell sarcomatoid renal carcinoma with fever, pain management due to symptomatic first-line bone metastases and for systemic treatment decisions.
The patient had no other history.
Initially he had a fever of 39.0 °C on March 12, 2020, for which he received ceftriaxone outside our center.
On day 6, the patient had mild cough and fever (38.3°C), which led to a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; the result was positive.
The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 ward of our hospital and closely monitored.
Chest CT scan showed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities associated with COVID-19 (figure 1).
D7 was started on antiviral therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir (400mg/100mg orally) and continued for 5 days according to local guidelines.
On day 8, a sudden dyspnea and a drop in saturation forced the patient to increase oxygen to 6 l/min, without the need for mechanical ventilation.
Two doses of tocilizumab were administered, with 8 mg/kg i.v.
at each dose, separated by 8 hours, with good tolerance.
After that, the patient showed clinical improvement, progressing to constipation rapidly and with a decretory oxygen consumption, which was completely removed on day 12.
A chest CT scan of day 12 confirmed the improvement, showing partial regression of pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities.
C-reactive protein, an indirect cytokine release marker, decreased from 225 mg/L to 33 mg/L in 4 days (figure 1).
No relevant changes were observed in▁lymphocytic subsets after tocilizumab administration and the percentage of CD4 + CD25 + lymphocytes was high before and after tocilizumab.
Finally, the patient fully became aware of the symptoms of COVID-19.
