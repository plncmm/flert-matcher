A patient from Morocco, who began 2 months earlier with left costal pain radiating to the back, pleuritic, fever of 38oC vespertine and cough with little mucous expectoration.
He had come to the emergency room on two occasions, where they only found anemia and in the chest X-ray: Mediastinal widening and referred to UDR.
Due to the fact that the dorsal pain increases in intensity and does not have common analgesics, the patient comes again to the emergency department.
Initial imaging findings and presumptive diagnosis: X-ray emergency: Posterior mediastinal enlargement and pulmonary involvement with bilateral micronodular pattern.
There are two dorsal disc spaces that are not properly visualized.
All this can correspond to pulmonary dissemination.
Abdominal CT: A lytic lesion in the vertebral body D6 that also affects D5-D6 and D7, suggestive of spondylodylodiscitis accompanied by pulmonary involvement with diffuse micronodular pattern.
MRI of the spine: Spondylodiscitis from D5 to D8 with involvement of the canal in the anterior and posterior face with fracture and‚ñÅcrushing of D5 and posterior protrusion of the vertebral body without myelopathy.
In addition, associated soft tissue involvement was compatible with associated abscess.
Recall of the case: fever patient with dorsalgia and differential diagnosis (TBC, Brucellosis, a neoformative process and or metastasis) should be considered.
Diagnostic suspicion was confirmed with positive biopsy of M. tuberculosis.
The micronodular pulmonary pattern resolves after treatment.
