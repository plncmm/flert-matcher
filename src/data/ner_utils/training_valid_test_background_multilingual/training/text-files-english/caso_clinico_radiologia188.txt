A 51-year-old woman with a 4-day history of foot infection with acetaminophen was admitted to the emergency department with fever, severe pain and functional impotence in the right upper limb, edema and swelling of the right upper limb.
After 48 hours, the patient returned to the emergency room with worsening of symptoms and deterioration of renal function, so a hospital admission was decided.
She presented dyspnea and low oxygen saturation, so a chest X-ray was taken to suspect septic embolism. Antibiotic was changed to Linezolid + Meropenem.
Chest CT confirms the presence of multiple bilateral nodules suggesting foci of sepsis and pleural effusion, transthoracic does not report valvular lesions or‚ñÅlymphoebscosis, right echocardiography findings and thrombophlebitis.
MRSA-positive cultures corroborate the diagnosis of septic embolism.
Final diagnosis: Septic embolism secondary to infectious thromboflebitis in RLL.
