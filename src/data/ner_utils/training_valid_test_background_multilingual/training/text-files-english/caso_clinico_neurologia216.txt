Anamnesis A 58-year-old male, with no known drug allergies or reported toxic consumption.
The following cardiovascular risk factors are highlighted: hypertension, dyslipidemia and type I obesity. Among the medical-surgical backgrounds, it is worth mentioning: BPH, GERD, migraines without aura, bilateral endoscopic phakectomy, nasal septoplasty by deviation.
The usual treatment is enalapril/ hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin and dutasteride/ tamsulosin.
She came to the emergency department with a sudden onset of headache, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, thermo-symptomatic fever of up to 38 oC, marked general▁malaise, with concomitant language impairment, progressive blocks and consciousness.
In the interview with the family, reviewing the medical and surgical history, we report the incidental fact of a sporadic nasal goiter of crystalline liquid through the left nasal fossa ORL for three years, after more than one surgical procedure.
Physical examination revealed a haemodynamically stable, eupneic, febrile, well hydrated, normoperfused, and normal color.
Cardiopulmonary arrest normal.
The abdomen was unaltered.
Normal lower extremities
Neurological impairment: conscious, with marked drowsiness, requiring▁vigorous stimuli to maintain the level of alertness, inattentive, partially disoriented in time and space, oriented in person.
It offers simple orders, answers questions, nomina, but spontaneous language emits some semantic and semantic paraphases.
Cranial pairs: normal VA, FO and campimetry due to normal confrontation.
MOI and MOE showed no alterations, no ptosis or nystagmus.
V motor and sensory preserved.
No facial features.
Normal lower limbs
Force with muscle balance 5/5 on all four limbs, with global +++ without REM, bilateral PFPS.
Feasibility at all levels and in all modalities.
No dysmetria, no dysdiadochokinesia.
Gait and statics not valued at the moment.
Extrapyramidal without findings.
Stiff neck, positive Kig sign.
Additional tests • Blood count: leukocytosis 27 x 1,000/mm3 (neutrophils 25.1 x 1,000/l).
• Coagulation: normal.
• Biochemistry: renal profile and hepatic profile unchanged.
CRP 1.8 mg/dl.
• Chest X-ray and ECG showed no significant findings.
• Lumbar puncture: turbid cerebrospinal fluid with pressure of 29 cm H2O, with the following cytobiochemistry: 1,620 cells/mm3 (78%, 21% MN), glucose 19 mg/dl proteins (722 mg/dl), PM
• Gram (LCR): G+ cocos, in clusters, as a preliminary result, with Streptococcus Viridans Group occurring in less than 24 hours, without significant resistance in the antibiogram.
• PCR pneumococci negative.
PCR for ESR and VZV negative.
• Serology: HAV, IgG positive antibody (13.62).
HBV: HBsAg negative.
Anti-HBc: IgG negative.
HCV: negative antibodies.
HIV: HIV (1,2): Ac.
and Ag.
negative.
• Cranial CT: study with no significant findings, except for the presence of partial occupation of the sinus is a left fenestration and both maxillary sinuses (on the right side with▁polypoid formations).
• Cranial MRI: CSF fistula through the cribriform plate and towards the ethmoid cells.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging: coronal FLAIR, in which CSF fistula is observed through the cribriform plate and toward the cells and sequences.
No meningeal inflammatory alterations were detected.
Diagnosis Bacterial meningoencephalitis with positive culture for Streptococcus viridans, possibly related to CSF fistula after ENT surgery.
Treatment: suspected clinical picture compatible with meningoencephalitis, and pending the microbiological results, antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and cefoxime was initiated, as well as antibiotic therapy with cefoxime responsible, during the 10 days of treatment, entering the plant.
The patients evolution is very satisfactory, and he is within 48 hours of the onset of asymptomatic symptoms, with a rigorous neurological examination.
f the history of chronic nasal goiter after septoplasty/polypectomy in 2009, with suspected CSF fistula, was interconsulted with otorhinolaryngology, which by fibroscopy could identify a clear exit of fluid.
The patient is referred for ENT surgery, requesting compassionate use of fluorescein for diagnosis and treatment, with endoscopic closure of the same.
