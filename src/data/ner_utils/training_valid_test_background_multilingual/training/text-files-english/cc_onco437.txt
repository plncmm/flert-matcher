Anamnesis A 74-year-old man with no known drug allergies, a 40 pack-year ex-smoker and moderate alcohol consumption, with a history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 stroke, and ischemic stroke in April 2016 GOLD.
He was diagnosed in 2012 with a multiple myeloma Ig G Kappa ISS II, which was treated with a scheme based on lenalidomide, dexamethasone and otuzumab maintained in a complete clinical trial phase 3 with a control.
Myeloma sequel develops chronic renal failure stage 3A.
She received medical treatment with statins, oral antidiabetics, ACEI and bronchodilators.
▁Oncologic history and non- AL patient classification a was diagnosed in August 2017 of a positive TTF-1 lung adenocarcinoma treated by left lower lobectomy resulting in a pT1a (1 cm) N0 (0/5) M0, according to AJ.
In the control chest CT (June 2018), translocated positive paratracheal lymph nodes are described retroesophageal and paratracheal right, the cytology of the latter being positive for undifferentiated AL carcinoma, CK.
A PET-CT study was completed, which also described a right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy suggestive of tumour inversion.
With these results, the patient is referred to as a second primary N3 without T (cTxN3M0) taxing chemotherapeutic treatment (QT-RT radical intention) with total QT cycle (TcxN34.8 Gy) concomitant with RT + wine.
Response PET-CT showed partial response (PR) morphometabolic at the adenopatic level, but there was uptake in the right palatine tonsil with ipsilateral laterocervical lymphadenopathy II.
It is then stated that the primary tumor, until now unknown, could be ̄ino and after discussing both multidisciplinary committees (thorax and ENT) it is considered a candidate for right ̈cally assisted ̈ diagnostic/therapeutic treatment.
Pathological Anatomy Report describes an undifferentiated carcinoma of 2 cm, HPV, TTF-1 and ALK negative, CK7, AE1/AE3 and p16 positive with a Ki67 of 90 % described in cytology similar characteristics to
Controls were decided and the PET-CT of February 2018 showed evidence of disappearance of the adenopathy of level IIb with stability (PR maintained) of the adenopathy with no further uptake "small intestine" in treatment, except for mild hypercholesterolemia.
Current disease In February 2019, emergency department consultation for melenas, highlighting in the analytical▁frank anemization (Hb 66g/dl), alteration of liver profile, severe hypoalbuminemia and worsening of renal function.
The patient explains a toxic syndrome of one month of evolution.
The decision was made to admit the patient to the emergency medical ward.
Personal dimensioning PS 3.
Awareness and guidance on three
No cardiac murmurs and rhythmic tones.
There were no auscultations of sounds overwhelmed in the lung fields.
There are no limb edemas.
The abdomen is blunt and depressible, and do not highlight masses or enlargements.
There is no neurological focus on admission.
Analytical tests » (08/2019), Hb 66g/l, MCV 88 (normocytic normochromic anaemia with normal AST glomerular bilirubin UA of 35 ml/ 1.73m2, 62 IU/l
Severe hypoalbuminemia of 15.8g/l.
Leukocytosis with neutrophilia.
» Bone marrow aspirate (07/2019):▁erythropoiesis ferropénica without other findings.
» Colonoscopy (20/2/2019): adenomatous lesion of 3-4 cm, pale, at ileocecal level that is▁resected.
No other findings.
Pathological anatomy: fragments of mucosa showing poorly differentiated carcinoma with the same pathological characteristics as previous lesions.
» Angio-CT (21/2019): the presence of multiple nodular hyperdense images located within the ileal loops and that could correspond to intraoral implants is noteworthy.
Adenopathic lesion of 2 cm in the left paraaortic region and adenopathic lesions of the mesentery.
At the splenic level, a 2 cm nodular lesion is observed in the anterior splenic pole that was not present in previous CT scans.
Diagnosis » Undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown primary with supra- and infradiaphragmatic lymph node dissemination, seplénic, intra-aortic stenosis and plaques of Peyer in small intestine.
» Digestive bleeding secondary to endonasal tumoral lesions.
Treatment Symptomatic management was achieved with transfusion of ~48hours as required and hyperproteic delivery without achieving improvement in the parameters or cessation of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patients condition required a progressive increase in transfusional support and developed severe hypoalbuminemia, triggering a secondary anasarca.
The case was evaluated as an undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown origin with exclusive involvement of▁lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to intestinal implants without possibility of local treatment (endoscopic, surgical or interventional radiology) due to its distance.
The patient had a torpid evolution with the consequent death in March 2019.
After the consent of her family, an autopsy was performed, which reported the presence of > 100▁polypoid lesions distributed throughout the small intestine and two▁polypoid lesions in the gastric body, confirming the presence of multiple adenodiaphragms.
