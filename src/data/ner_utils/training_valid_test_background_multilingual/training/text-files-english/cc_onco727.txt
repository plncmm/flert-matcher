» Chest X-ray revealed no condensation or infiltrates.
Hemocultives x 2, urocultive, culture of MID wound and culture of oral mucosa plaque were extracted.
Diagnosis The diagnostic judgment of the patient was compatible with grade IV febrile neutropenia (deep), surgical wound infection and oropharyngeal candidiasis.
Treatment A hospital admission was decided.
Inverse isolation, rest and absolute diet were recommended, as well as administration of G-CSF and empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem and vancomycin.
After positive culture of the wound in MID for pseudomona aeruginosa, treatment was adjusted according to antibiogram, de-escalating intravenous ceftazidime.
Treatment was established with intravenous fluconazole due to Candida albicans growth in oral mucosal plaque culture.
The patients condition improved clinically, maintaining her usual PS.
However, after more than ten days of admission, the neutrophil count remained at 0 thousand/mm3.
The case was discussed with Hematology, which recommended bone marrow study.
A bone marrow aspirate was performed, which was reported as a phenotypic study with no evidence of myeloid hyperplasia and absence of myeloid series (agranulocytosis).
Analysis of the sample obtained in the aspirate was requested by flow cytometry, with findings consistent with agranulocytosis, striking relative oocytes and red series increase.
A non-negligible cell population in some extensions of non-haematological aspect without formation of nests was also described, possibly related to metastatic melanoma.
The active confirmation of malignant melanoma in melanoma is currently ongoing (one month after admission) in the absolute absence of neutrophils, but we are discouraged due to the fact that we have received more oncological treatment.
Consensus was reached on the patient and the family member referred to the Palliative Care Unit for symptomatic treatment.
