A 42-year-old female patient with a history of Sjögren's syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis was referred to the Uveitis Unit from the Neuroophthalmology Section for finding foci of temporal▁retinochondrium.
The patient had presented two previous episodes of acute temporal scotoma in the left eye in the last five years, which were controlled in the Neuroophthalmology Section and had been labeled positive toxoplasma IgM optic neuritis due to weak IgG.
These two episodes had been treated with cotrimoxazole and prednisone and the temporary scotoma was resolved ad▁integrum.
In the examination in the Uveitis Unit visual acuity (VA) was 1 in both eyes, no pupillary alterations were observed, the anterior segment was normal and the intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes.
The eye fundus of the right eye was normal and the left eye showed a vitreous without inflammation, presence of two foci of chorioretinitis and a well-defined optic disc with normal color.
A visual field was carried out showing a temporal and inferior turciform scotoma.
Ocular fundus autofluorescence showed an area of hyperautofluorescence around the optic disc that extended around the superior temporal arcade.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an important thinning of the outer nuclear layer and disruption of the outer limiting membrane and the ellipsoid zone in the hyperautofluorescence zone.
At this time we ruled out the diagnosis of toxoplasmic optic neuritis and, given the history, the findings of temporal scotoma without involvement of the optic nerve and the evidence of acute idiopathic retinal syndrome according to OCT and autofluorescence.
Treatment was established with prednisone 30 mg/day in descending doses and in the last control, six months later, VA was 1 in both eyes, OCT showed a smaller size of the retinal hyperautofluorescence area.
The visual field had also improved, although there was an increase in blind spot and a lower scotoma.
