Anamnesis 68-year-old woman with stage IIIA malignant ductal carcinoma (DDC).
In active cancer treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she comes to the emergency department for fever and persistent chills.
▁Oncological history Female, 68 years old, Caucasian, currently retired (flight fatigue in her professional life).
His personal history included hypertension, hypothyroidism and several minor depressive episodes.
There are no known toxic habits, adverse drug reactions or personal surgical history.
She has no family history of cancer.
As home treatment, enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained 20/12.5 mg/day, levothyroxine 75 mcg/day and lorazepam 1 mg/day.
In January 2019, 67 years old, the patient was assessed due to a lesion in the right nipple, ezema-erythema, which had evolved over several months and was asymptomatic.
The Committee initiated a study for suspected breast cancer, with diagnosis of breast IDC, histological grade 3, estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, receptor 2▁epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER-2 50%).
▁Complementary tests described an increase in right breast density (BIA-RADS type 4) and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes (by mammography and breast and axillary ultrasound, respectively).
The diagnosis of carcinoma is confirmed by core needle biopsy (GNB), both of the breast and one of the axillary lymph nodes.
The extension study (breast magnetic resonance imaging, chest, abdomen and pelvis CT with contrast and bone scintigraphy) ruled out the presence of distant disease.
Neoadjuvant treatment was proposed based on weekly paclitaxel (containing 12 cycles) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (1 cycle to date).
Current history Two weeks after receiving chemotherapy, the patient came to the emergency department with urethral burning, dysuria and intermittent chills sensation of three days of evolution.
The physical examination and the complementary tests requested showed signs compatible with low risk febrile neutropenia and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection, so he was discharged with oral antibiotic, three doses of stimulating factor granulocytic colonies measures.
However, the patient comes on a second occasion, ten days later, due to persistent dysuria, worsening of chills and fever (maximum 38.2o thermometry added to total joint pain, non-arthritic pain).
Physical examination Constants: 183/63 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, RR 15 rpm, SatO2 97 % (AP) and Ta 37.7oC.
Establishment plan for 2002
It seems good general condition.
Eupneic at rest.
Colourless.
Adequate distal perfusion.
Establishment by devices and systems: neurological, head and neck, cardiorespiratory, abdominal and limb examinations do not show remarkable pathological signs or reveal▁anomalous findings.
▁Complementary tests: High C-reactive protein (CRP) (426.4 mg/l; NV 0-5), high procalcitonin (1.2 ng/ml; VN < 0.251 and 40 UDHl-240) are highlighted in emergency biochemistry
Blood count revealed normochromic normocytic anemia (Hb 8.5 g/dl; VN 12-16) and thrombocytosis (504,000/μl; VN 150,000-450,000).
The neutrophil count has recovered.
Coagulation is normal.
The electrocardiogram and chest X-ray PA and lateral do not show signs of ischemia or reveal parenchymal consolidations or pleural effusion, respectively.
The urinary sediment is pathological, revealing the presence of microscopic hematuria, pyuria and abundant bacteriuria.
Nitrites are negative.
The urine culture requested in the previous visit to the emergency department is negative.
Differential and urocultive hemocultives are also requested.
Diagnosis of complicated UTI resistant to oral antibiotic therapy in immunocompromised patients.
Treatment In-hospital admission with intravenous antibiotic therapy aimed at urinary focus, consisting of ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hours, and preferential performance of urological ultrasound.
Patients evolution was stable.
During hospitalization, antibiotic therapy is administered directed to the urinary focus.
Urological ultrasound does not demonstrate the presence of abscess or dilatation via the excretory route.
Despite the absence of microbiological isolates, the patient continues with fever, associated dysthermia and worsening of the general clinical status, with limiting asthenia.
Antibiotic coverage with piperacillin-tazo and vancomycin was increased, and new cultures were extracted.
Emergency rooms are negative.
A transthoracic echocardiogram and CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast were requested to rule out complications that justify the clinical picture.
The first one describes a slight periaortic thickening of doubtful significance; the second one reveals the presence of a striking thickening and enhancement of the aortic arch, of the descending aorta and of the great vessels vasculitis.
With this suspicion as a possible cause of the febrile syndrome, immunological and autoimmunity study, viral serology and study of possible drugs triggering iatrogenesis were requested.
As remarkable results, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SGA; 140 mm; VN 1-20) and a positive low titer (1 antinuclear antibodies ANA), both nonspecific, are noteworthy.
IgG4 titer is normal.
All serology tests were negative and the patient did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of rheumatic disease.
Once the other causes have been ruled out, the diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis secondary to probable medicaments (G-CSF) is considered.
The administration of this drug is prohibited and treatment with high doses of oral prednisone is initiated.
