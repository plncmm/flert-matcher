Background We report the case of a 74-year-old white patient with a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, who had undergone a stent in the descending coronary artery in 2000.
In addition, she suffered from severe mitral regurgitation; therefore, she had undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve in 2001.
Later, he developed a heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 22% and a functional class (FC) III/IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) program Set up to 120 ms.
In this procedure, 2 grams of cephalothin were administered prophylactically, with good response.
Clinical picture The patient attended a consultation 4 years after implantation of the responsive (2008) due to symptoms of 3 consecutive days of progressive dyspnea, ortopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fever.
On admission, the patient had a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 x", an axillary temperature of 38.5oC, moderate oxygen saturation of 78%, sternotomy.
Cardiac sounds were rhythmic with normal mechanical valve click and edema in lower limbs grade II. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary creatinine congestion and blood tests showed: leukocytes = 16,700 x mm3 blood vasodilating serum creatinine; blood flow = 3.42 mmol/dl; blood vasodilatation; blood flow = 3.27 mg/dl; platelets = 3.27 mg/dl; platelets = 3.27 mg/dl; blood; blood flow restriction = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mg/dl; blood; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; platelets = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; platelets = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood = 3.27 mmol/dl; blood; blood; blood = 3.27 mmol/
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed due to suspected infective endocarditis, since the patient persisted with fever, a mobile endo mass adhering to the patient's initial gram-positive endocarditis dose 1, and treatment with vancomycin was initiated according to the patient.
Blood cultures were positive for multi-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Antibiotic therapy was administered for 6 weeks with very good response, so it was decided not to remove the pacemaker wire or mitral valve.
The control echocardiogram at 6 weeks showed resolution of the mass adherent to the electrode.
