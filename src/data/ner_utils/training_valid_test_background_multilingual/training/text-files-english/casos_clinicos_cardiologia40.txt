They were 59 years old with high fever (39o) of 2 days of evolution and an episode of seizures.
He's stuporous.
BP 97/80 mmHg.
Fc 132 bpm.
SatO2 95%.
Fr 22 rpm.
Ta 34.2oC.
Quota of SEPSIS GRAVE: Ta34.2.
Acute renal failure (Creatinine 2.2); elevated PCT and CRP; Hypotical (97 hypopnea) with signs of poor perfusion (frequented and severe x ́high cholesterol') Taperuria (bicarbonate).
The COC is unknown.
Sepsis induced hypoxia: 2,000 cc of Physiological Serum are administered and 1,500 cc of SF are subsequently administered in the ICU.
-> maintains PA 105/75 2) atrial fibrillation at 130 x ́ -> AMIODARONA IV .... -> Sinus rhythm.
3) Antibiotic?
After studying 2 blood cultures -> MEROPENEM IV, -> In ICU we opted for CLOXACILINA + CEFOTAXIMA + CIPROFLOXACIN.
–> and subsequently: CLOXACILINA + DAPTOMICINA -> currently CLOXACILINA + GENTAMICINA.
4. Convulsive seizure that recurs within a few hours.
CT: SUBARACNOIDEA HEMORRAGIA, probably related to plaque or infectious aneurysm (= fungal) -> begins with LEVETIRACETAM IV.
5. Plaque-form plate.
-> consultation with Hematology: "it does not meet criteria for TTP, HIT, nor for hemophagocytic syndrome; ITP versus vasculitis in addition to septic picture is not ruled out".
Corticosteroids + platelet perfusion: a daily pool.
6. PCUCO search: A transthoracic echocardiogram is performed. No evidence of seizures is visualized.
7. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in order to detect pulmonary embolism in the anterior valve of the right atrium.
9. Interconsultation with Cardiovascular Surgery: at the present time surgical treatment due to SAH is rejected.
New evaluation after 6 weeks.
10. The appearance of purpuric (ecchymotic) lesions of probable embolic origin in finger pulps and soles of the feet.
After one week in the ICU, she remains stable.
Set up to floor.
DIAGNOSTIC JUICE: – MITRAL ENDOCARDITIS on valve with myxomatous degeneration by S. AUS.
- SEPSIS SEVERA with RENAL AFFAI (running discharge).
PLAQUETOPENIA SEVERA.
- SUBARACNOIDEA HEMORRAGIA.
Generalized EPILEPTIC CRISIS - ACxFA (reversed to sinus rhythm) Comment: The golden staphylococcal: S. aureus lives in cutaneous wound, more serious cutaneous infections ->
