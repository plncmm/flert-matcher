A 29-year-old male, fisherman, first seen in the emergency room for vomiting, asthenia, myalgia and fever, was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and discharged with symptomatic treatment.
Five days later, the patient consulted again due to persistent symptoms and weakness: hypotension, tachycardia, and poor general health. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, thrombopenia, elevated lactate creatine kinase, acute renal failure.
It was decided to enter internal medicine with fluid therapy and support treatment.
In the following 12 hours, hemodynamic and respiratory deterioration was observed and the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
After abdominal imaging tests that ruled out the possibility of extraction of hemocultives and complete analytical with viral serology, atypical microorganisms and possible zoonoses, empirical antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and Doxi is initiated.
The patient needs mechanical ventilation, continuous hemodialysis, vasoactive drugs and alveolar recanalization maneuvers due to alveolar hemorrhage.
Subsequently, microbiological results are received: negative cultures, and serology for Leptospira spp.
Positive IgM, confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for Leptospira spp.
Weil's syndrome was confirmed in urine, and antibiotic treatment with Doxi was ruled out.
A good outcome was observed and the patient was discharged. Seroconversion was observed in subsequent revisions, with positive IgG and negative IgM for Leptospira spp.
