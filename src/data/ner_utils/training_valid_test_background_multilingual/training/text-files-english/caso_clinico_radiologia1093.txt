A 47-year-old woman with a history of severe abdominal pain of the colonic type, hypogastric, of approximately 18 days duration.
It was studied with coprocultive, fecal leukocytes, serology for yersinia, and colon, all within normal limits.
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed findings consistent with distal ileitis associated with dilation of the proximal bowel loops and uterine fibroids; given the good clinical evolution, she was discharged with symptomatic management.
The patient consulted again 10 days later, due to a picture similar to the previous one, with more intense pain, associated with marked abdominal distention due to CT, decrease in the elimination of gases and constipation of two days of evolution.
Diagnosis: Endometriosis of the distal ileum, an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction.
CT shows parietal thickening of the distal ileum, compatible with an ileitis, with greater secondary dilation of the proximal small intestine.
The patient had a history of abdominal pain associated with the onset of the menstrual cycle.
The patient was evaluated for severe gynerrhea, severe dysmenorrhea, disabling dyspareunia, chronic‚ñÅcyclic pelvic pain in relation to menstruation and the existence of a sister diagnosed with endometriosis.
Given these backgrounds and the findings of the studies, the diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis was suggested and it was decided to complement the study with computed tomography enteroclysis (CT-E), the first thickening cystic focus more adjacent bowel endometriosis associated with partial obstruction.
Given these findings, it was decided to perform a surgical resolution consisting of laparoscopic resection of the terminal and blind ileum, with subsequent enterocolic anastomosis.
Pathological examination showed a segment of ileum with multifocal endometriosis in the muscular layer of the right and subserosa, associated with peri-ileal endometriomas.
