A 26-year-old man came to the emergency department with sudden right pleural chest pain and progressive dyspnea for 3 days.
The patient had not traveled in the previous two weeks and had no history of chest trauma or fever, cough or other systemic symptoms.
He was otherwise healthy and did not take any medication.
His partner had cough nonsense for a week.
The patient preferred not to reveal further details.
On examination, vital signs showed normal temperature, blood pressure and pulse (118/80 and 122 l.p.m.).
He had mild respiratory distress with normal oxygen saturation in ambient air.
Her body mass index was 17.6 kg/m2.
Blood tests revealed▁lymphocytic colitis (0.969 [normal 1.0–3, × 109/L).
The chest X-ray showed a large right pneumothorax with complete collapse of the right lung, without mediastinal displacement.
Because of the patient's respiratory symptoms, a nasopharyngeal smear was performed for a RT-PCR test, which showed infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
A thoracic drainage tube was placed, which was subsequently removed; for the intervention the physician used a complete personal protective equipment, including a N95 mask.
After 48 hours, the patient's symptoms and pneumothorax resolved.
The patient was discharged from the hospital when stable and then reported complete disappearance of symptoms, by video-calling, on day 1 after discharge.
