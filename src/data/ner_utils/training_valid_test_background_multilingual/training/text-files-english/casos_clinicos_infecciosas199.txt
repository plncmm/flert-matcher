The case presented here is a 73-year-old male, without known drug allergies and former smoker for more than 40 years with a cumulative consumption of 30 packs/year.
His medical history included mild COPD GOLD stage 1 with baseline dyspnea 1/4, lumbosciatic with irradiation to the right lower limb for approximately 10 years secondary to a discal hernia that was under follow-up by angiotomography.
Regarding the epidemiological field, he lives in a rural environment, he has a horse and a horse, several dogs and hens apparently all healthy but without strict veterinary control, refers extraction of the right lower third molar two months ago without prophylaxis and not other interventions.
She is being treated with tramadol 37.5 mg / Paracetamol 325 mg every 8 hours.
He came to the emergency room with fever up to 39oC with "tiritone" and chills of 48 hours of evolution that responds to paracetamol, without clear predominance of hours.
The patient does not present pulmonary, digestive or abdominal symptoms as a possible focus, only referring that for about two months she has had pain in the right flank toward the right thigh muscles, which usually presents right sciatic pain and paresthesia more on the external face.
Examination revealed a temperature of 37.8oC and other controlled constants. The patient presented an acceptable general status with no data of infection at the recently extracted molar level, no palpable peripheral adenopathies, no relevant skin▁rigidity.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal and showed normal anodyne pressure pain in the right musculature with presence of muscle contracture. Lassegue and Bragard maneuvers were negative.
Blood tests and chest X-rays were performed on arrival to the emergency department. Blood count showed hemoglobin (Hb) 15.2g/g/g, leukocytes 8200 cells/mcL with neutrophilia of 73%.
Coagulation with TP% and biochemistry with glucose, creatinine, and hepatic profile within normal limits, highlighting only C-reactive protein (CRP) in 106 mg/l.
In AP and lateral chest X-rays, there was aortic elongation with no other changes in lung parenchyma.
In the emergency department, it is classified as a short-term fever without source, urine and blood samples are extracted and sent to the Infectious Diseases Clinic, initiating empirical antibiotic treatment with Amoxicillin.
125 mg clavulanic acid every 8 hours for oral use.
Twenty hours after the extraction, the patient grew in the hemocultives group 2/2 S. antimicrobial agent and equi subspecies zooepidemicus sensitive to penicillin (CMI 0.063 mcg/ml) finding with cefadxone optimization (CMI 0.063
On the ward, both the clinical history and the complementary tests performed were superimposable to those obtained in the emergency department, a new blood culture was extracted "cold" because the patient had responded favorably to amoxicillin/clavulanate heart failure.
• Contrast enhanced tomography scan performed: marked aortic elongation with mural thrombosis and aneurysmal dilatation of 5 cm in the descending thoracic aorta; abdomen without relevant findings; no evidence of infection in the abdomen
• dorsolumbar NMR: extensive degenerative changes in the vertebral and discs with foramina stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1, the most marked in L5-S1.
There were no signs of edema with an infectious appearance in the bodies, or irregularities in the epiphyseal platforms or in interconnected discs.
Urocultiva extracted in the Emergency Department was negative as well as the hemocultive extracted in the plant (due to previous antibiotic therapy), in view of the results of the complementary tests and given the characteristics of the microorganism a test was carried out.
Differential diagnosis The case presented here is a 79-year-old man who consulted the emergency department due to a fever of 4-5 days of evolution and exacerbation of chronic epidemy in red blood cells for chronic urticaria.
An adequate history and physical examination are essential to determine the severity of the illness and its possible origin or focus.
We must therefore determine the place of acquisition of bacteremia (in the community, nosocomial or healthcare associated), ask if the patient has any underlying disease and collect clinical, exploratory and epidemiological data when we search for guidance.
In our case, it was a male with no history of interest except recurrent right sciatica, rural environment and molar extraction two months ago, who was hemodynamically stable, and without any other significant sign of endocarditis case in the following series.
No other clinical, exploratory data were found but relegated the same possibility, nor fulfilled major and minor criteria of infectious endocarditis, so even in the absence of transesophageal echocardiography this possibility seemed unlikely, not totally alternative.
In the search for other possible foci and given the symptomatology of pain at the level, there is already a case that expanded the study with imaging tests in view of the possibility of a bacteremia that would have settled on a previously pathological vertebra.
MRI of the back and lumbar spine showed degenerative changes in the vertebral spine especially at L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels, but without the presence of an infectious focus at this level.
At the toco-abdominal CT, the presence of an aneurysmal dilatation already known at the level of the descending thoracic aorta was evidenced, together with mural thrombosis, with no changes compared to previous studies.
One possibility would be infection of this aneurysm or thrombus acting as an endovascular infection, since this microorganism has also been described in association with aortic aneurysms3,4.
Unfortunately, the second hemocultive was negative, and it could not be ruled out that it was because we were in a transient bacteremia (if persistent, it would favor endovascular infection), or because we had received previous antibiotic therapy.
Given the patient's stability, a "washing period" of antibiotic therapy could have been performed, temporarily suspending them and extracting the hemocultive subsequently, which would have helped us in the diagnosis, but this possibility was not met.
Other possible foci of bacteremia due to S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus described as meningitis, arthritis or pneumonia were ruled out for not presenting clinical or exploratory data of neurological or joint involvement or for having a probable endocarditis primary angiomyx.
The patients condition was favorable and the prescribed treatment persisted with persistent afferent.
Since S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus bacteremia has been associated with aneurysm infection and our patient had a descending aorta aneurysm with left ventricular thrombus extension and adjacent descending aorta FDG-CT was requested with the following result:
These findings are compatible with an inflammatory process, namely the presence of an entity, in the clinical context of patients with a possible infectious origin.
No pathological cardiac foci were observed in the endocardium or cardiac valves suggesting the existence of endocarditis.
Axial skeleton showed no lesions or evident metabolic increase.
Chest CT: We observed marked aortic elongation with mural thrombosis and 5 cm aneurysmal dilatation at the descending thoracic aorta.
No evidence of infectious focus was found on the examination.
PET-CT (Axial): The image shows the presence of hypermetabolic foci in the descending thoracic aorta at the level of its left contour (SUVmax=7.51), affecting adjacent soft tissues and extension.
At the level of the thrombus no uptake was observed.
These findings are compatible with the
PET-CT (Coronal and Sagital): In the latter image, we observed hypermetabolic foci in the descending thoracic aorta at the level of its left contour, in the clinical context of the patient with possible infectious origin.
PET-CT findings were completed 2 weeks with ceftriaxone 2 gr/IV every 12 hours and then 6 weeks with oral levofloxacin 750 mg (MIC 1 mcg/ ml).
The Cardiovascular Surgery Department was consulted to refer the patient to an external consultation for delayed intervention after healed the current infectious process, due to the findings of a 5-cm diameter aneurysm.
The control blood cultures at 2 weeks and 2 months after the end of antibiotic therapy were negative and control CT angiography showed persistent mural thrombus and dilatation had not increased cardiovascular surgery, remaining pending intervention.
A diagnosis was established regarding ascending aortic aneurysm due to S. equi subspecies zoonoticus with secondary bacteremia in patients with contact with horses.
