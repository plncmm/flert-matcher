A 17-year-old male with a history of falls in his back a week before.
He came to the emergency room for lumbosacro pain radiating to the left.
Lumbosacro CT and pelvic MRI showed multiple malformations in left iliopsoas and piriformis suggestive of hematomas, without fracture traces.
Given the poor clinical evolution, MRI was repeated, showing diffuse uptake of the left iliac joint fluid inside, edema in relation to the sacrum, and persistence of the more organized abscesses and sacrum with extension, more extensive appearance of the bone abscess.
Surgical drainage was performed with positive culture for Staphylococcus aureus.
It was a posttraumatic infectious sacroiliitis associated with abscesses in the adjacent musculature.
