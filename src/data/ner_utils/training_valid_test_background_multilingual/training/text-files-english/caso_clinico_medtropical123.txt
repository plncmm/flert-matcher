Personal history Senegal's natural patient who had lived in Spain for eight years.
He traveled to Senegal several months before the consultation.
No other relevant background.
Current disease Four months ago the patient had increased diameter of the left lower limb, with no other remarkable symptoms.
Physical examination revealed lymphedema in the left lower limb grade II-III.
There are no areas of liquenification, dermatitis or subcutaneous nodules.
‚ñÅComplementary laboratory tests showed normal blood count, but no abnormalities.
IgE levels were high (425.8 IU/mL).
Chest and abdominal X-rays and Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs were normal except for the finding of reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies, mainly left ones, with lymph nodes dilated at that level were observed in a nonpelvic CT scan.
Subcutaneous tubular structures compatible with lymph were visualized in the left flank.
Clinical judgement Probable lymphatic filariasis.
No deaths were observed in Knott tests performed (12, 22, 24 and 2 hours).
Likewise, serology against IgG lymph node filariasis (G1-G2-G3-G4) and PCR for filariae and Loa loa were negative.
Lymphography was also performed, and there was no evidence of dilatation or lymphatic collateral circulation.
The patient did not attend follow-up visits after the revisions, so the current situation is unknown.
filariasis is produced by nematodes called filariae and transmitted by arthropod bites.
More characteristically, Wuchereria bancrofti produces perineal and genital lymphedema, and Brugia malayi in the lower limbs.
Onchocerca volvulus infections are associated and characterized by chorioretinitis -with risk of blindness- to asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules, while Loa loa migratory edema is more frequent.
