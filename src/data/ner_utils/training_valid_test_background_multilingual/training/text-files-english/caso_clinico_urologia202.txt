Anamnesis A 65-year-old male presented the following background: chronic enolism, sigmoidectomy with discharge due to left incarcerated inguinal hernia and chronic renal failure.
Low socioeconomic status, with poor hygienic-sanitary conditions.
Nephrourological history: 6 months before the current admission, she was admitted for acute fungal urinary failure with bilateral grade III hydronephrosis, BPH and large bladder stones, without being able to establish the presence of bladder.
After urethral catheterization, there was no significant improvement in renal function, persistent ectasia of the upper urinary tract, so it was decided to place a bilateral nephrostomy, after which renal function improved to baseline levels.
During the same admission, a transvesical prostatic adenomectomy and a cystolithectomy were performed.
The postoperative period was characterized by surgical wound infection by Enteroccocus faecalis, requiring antibiotic treatment and vacuum device (VAC) for its closure.
After 2 months of hospitalization, the patient was discharged after closure and removal of both nephrostomies and removal of the urinary catheter, with stable renal function around 2.5 mg/dl creatinine.
The patient consulted in the Emergency Department of the hospital for a clinical picture of fever, asthenia, anorexia, hematuria, oliguria and lower urinary tract symptoms of several days of evolution.
Physical examination At admission to the emergency department showed poor general condition, was conscious and oriented, with skin coldness, loose stools on the lower limbs and no neurological focus.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmurs or friction and preserved vesicular murmur.
Thigh blood pressure
The abdomen was blushing, non-painful, with no signs of peritoneal irritation, with no evidence of visceromegaly or masses.
Patients evolution was satisfactory.
▁Complementary tests An abdominal X-ray, blood and urine analysis, urinocultives and abdominal ultrasound were requested in the emergency department: • Blood analysis: urea 354 mg/dl, creatinine 8.3 mg/dl, blood potassium 7.500 mEq/dl
Venous gastrin: pH 6.9, bicarbonate 7.7 mmol/l, ABE -25 mmol/l.
• Urinary sediment: pH 9, leucocyturia and hematuria.
Gram-positive bacilli and▁cocci are seen in the urine gram.
• Abdominal X-ray: anodina.
• Abdominal ultrasound: Bilateral hydronephrosis, aiming at a linear calcified throughout the urothelial tissue of both renal pelvis, as well as in groups kidney stones.
The right ureter showed urothelial thickening and calcification of the wall with characteristics similar to those of the rest of the urothelium.
Wide walls thickened, poorly repleted, and with probe inside.
Previous studies and training without such qualifications.
During admission: • Urinocultiva: Staphylococcus capitis sube DISPOSAL urealitycum and Gram positive bacilli Corynebacterium type.
• Non-contrast enhanced CT: linear, polygonal calcification in both renal sinuses.
Characteristic findings of pyelitis incrus.
Bilateral hydronephrosis.
Diagnosis Pyelitis incruscia.
Treatment and evolution An urgent hemodialysis session is performed due to the patient's hydroelectrolytic deterioration and renal function, subsequently requiring infusion of vasoactive drugs due to sustained hypotension, which were removed in the successive days after the constant episodes.
Because of the initial laboratory findings and urealytic tests (their comparative discordance with the previous imaging tests (without alterations), it was decided to perform an abdominal CT without contrast, which gave the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (ureteritis).
Empirical antibiotic therapy was initially established and then modified according to the antibiogram (treatment with vancomycin was started).
Initially, the patient achieved satisfactory recovery, with improvement in the levels of renal function, hydrolytic correction and removal of vasoelectrolyte drugs stability of the hemodynamic constants.
Subsequently, the patient developed sudden fever, respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability, and died within a few hours after two weeks of hospitalization.
