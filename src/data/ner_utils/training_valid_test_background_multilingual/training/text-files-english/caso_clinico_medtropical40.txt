Nine months old, residing in Vargas State, northwestern Capital District, developed acute myotis and postmortem diagnosis was made on finding T. cruzi trypomastigotes in myocardial biopsy.
The mother reported having found a "chipo" (common name in Venezuela) in the child's crib a few weeks before the onset of symptoms, but did not associate it with the disease.
In his middle-class house, on the foot of the mountain of the mountain range of the Costa del Litoral Central Venezuela, there was a deposit with palm ceiling, from which probably came the wine.
When examining 82 people, predominantly children, inhabitants of this and other‚ñÅneighboring houses, all were negative for T. cruzi infection; however, 21 P.geniculatus were found, of which 13 were infected with T. cruzi.
