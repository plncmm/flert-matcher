A 19-year-old male underwent neuroblastoma surgery.
She had a one-month history of evening fever and weight loss.
No other accompanying symptoms and normal physical examination.
Blood tests showed leukopenia, neutropenia and progressive anaemia, with atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood extension.
Elevation of transaminase and hypertriglyceridemia with elevated acute phase reactants and proteinogram with hypergammaglobulinemia.
Serology for CMV, EBV, HSV1 and 2, parvovirus B19, hepatitis A, B and C, rubella and toxoplasma were performed to rule out mononucleosis, with negative results.
Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, and Brucella, HIV and CLIA were also amplified, as were hemocultive agents, mantoux and urocultive agents performed.
Echocardiography was within normal limits, without vegetations.
Autoimmunity was negative.
The etiology was established by CT scan, detection of the neoplasm, and the lesion was enlarged in 16.7cm, with no significant abnormalities.
The symptoms persisted and the patient suffered a progressive deterioration.
Our differential diagnosis was between Sd.
Ball-limited▁lymphoproliferative disorder, Sd.
Hemophagocytic or parasitosis.
We performed an immune balance with a tendency to inversion CD4/CD8 and PAMO with discrete▁erythroid dysplasia probably related to folic acid, reactive lecitocytosis and cytological features of hemophagocytosis or in pigmentation.
Before performing more invasive tests, we requested PCR to Leishmania, which was positive, after which treatment with Amphotericin B was started, ceasing fever at 48h and normalizing the clinical and analytical parameters.
