We report the case of a 45-year-old man who came to the emergency department for presenting progressive dyspnea for approximately two weeks accompanied by worsening dyspnea.
He worked in a floristry school and did not mention any background of interest.
Having travelled recently or been exposed to environmental toxic agents
Physical examination revealed a fever of 38oC, tachypnea, tachycardia, oxyhemoglobin saturation 93% at room air and crackles in bilateral middle fields.
The chest X-ray showed bilateral parahilar alveolar opacification, and the analytical highlighted a leukocyte count of 16,920 leukocytes/μL and a C-reactive protein value of 22 mg bicarbonate gas/dL p mEq2, 19
On admission, treatment with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone was started with poor response persisting fever and general▁malaise.
A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung showed areas of increased density in both upper lobes and segment 6 suggestive of inflammatory-infectious lung disease.
▁Pneumococcal and legionella antigenuria, blood cultures and serology (acute phase) for Mycoplasma, Clamydia, Legionella and Coxiella were negative.
The patient is then treated with topical salicylic acid (500 mg/ 24 hours).
Due to the lack of response,▁bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy was performed.
The pathological study showed type II pneumocytic hyperplasia, inflammation of the alveolar wall and myxomatous degeneration of the alveolar septa all of this compatible with acute organized fibrinoid pneumonia.
After the anatomopathological result, treatment with prednisone 0.5 mg/kg was started, and the fever and dyspnea disappeared.
During follow-up visits, the corticosteroid dose has been progressively lowered, and the drug has been discontinued after 3 months.
At the last follow-up chest HRCT scan, no pulmonary condensations or lesions were observed.
