A 16-year-old girl with a history of asthma was referred to the outpatient clinic for asymptomatic cutaneous lesions that had evolved for two months.
The patient had been treated with corticoid cream due to initial suspicion of atopic eczema, despite the progressive marked growth of the lesions.
As a history of interest in the anamnesis, he had a domestic cat that had never taken the veterinarian.
Physical examination revealed annular plaques with an active peripheral edge located in the upper back area and in the lateral faces of neck and face.
Trichomon rubrum was isolated from the local culture obtained with scraping.
The diagnosis of tinea incognito was established with clinical data and culture.
Treatment with Terbinafine 250mg/day for 4 weeks was initiated with resolution of the symptoms.
