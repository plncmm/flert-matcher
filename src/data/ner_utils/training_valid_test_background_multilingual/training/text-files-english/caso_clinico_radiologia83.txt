A 34-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of dyspnea,‚ñÅmalaise, and pruritic rash.
Laboratory tests showed iron deficiency anemia.
You have a kid with chickenpox.
Suspicion of varicella and after chest X-ray (dispercussion of the X-ray findings by a clinician who attended it) was decided specific treatment and home rest.
Two days later she presented with increased dyspnea and extreme fatigue.
The emergency radiologist consulted and after reviewing the previous X-ray, it was decided to perform a chest CT. On CT scan, multiple nodular opacities with halo diameters between 5-10 mm were observed, with a tendency to say "higher calcified lobe"
The most likely diagnosis is viral bronchopneumonia secondary to varicella-zoster and whose perifill pulmonary opacities are probably due to the corresponding familial epidemiology of the patient, clinical signs and imaging findings.
