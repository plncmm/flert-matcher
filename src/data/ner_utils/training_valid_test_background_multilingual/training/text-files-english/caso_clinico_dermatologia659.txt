A 12-year-old male patient with a history of atopic dermatitis under control and regular treatment.
A sportsman, he performs an enduro motocross.
The patient reported a three-week history of pruritic lesions located on the face, particularly in the right periocular region.
The patient was treated with an extra-systemic approach, where acute dermatitis was diagnosed, indicating moderate potency topical corticosteroids.
The patient was successfully treated for the first three days.
However, one week later, he consulted our medical center for the recurrence of the lesions, which were more inflammatory and erythematous.
The presence of pustules located mainly in the right upper eyelid and ipsilateral ciliary border was remarkable.
Considering the use of helmets and anti-parks (roce) it was interpreted as a secondary friction rub.
Additionally, by contact with soil, a direct mycological study and current culture were requested.
These tests were negative, so it was requested a culture of specie that sampling was outside the hair follicles.
The result was positive for Trichomon menta migrates.
The patient had already started empirically treatment with itraconazole 100 milligrams a day, progressing favorably one week after treatment.
Initially, due to the marked inflammatory nature of the lesions, it was decided to maintain a topical corticosteroid of lower potency than previously used and only for a three-day course.
Finally, he completed one month of itraconazole without complications or recurrences.
A new‚ñÅculturing was performed two months after starting treatment, which was negative.
