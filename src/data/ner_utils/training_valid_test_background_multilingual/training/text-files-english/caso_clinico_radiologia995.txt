It is important to see the "blind tasks" of chest X-ray in order not to lose important clues.
These areas are under the diaphragm, behind the heart, hilium, and blade tissues.

Little bladder does not conform to the usual intestinal configuration.
In this clinical context, an important differential diagnosis to be considered is rupture of a liver abscess.
This can be confirmed at the side of the lake with ultrasound or CT.
Liver abscesses are usually due to organisms such as Klebsiella or Ame.
All patients with Klebsiella bacteremia of unknown origin should have imaging studies of the abdomen to rule out liver abscess.
