An 8-year-old boy affected by atopic dermatitis and multiple alleviation allergy to cow's milk, egg, nuts, fish and shellfish proteins.
Recent episode of angioedema after ingestion of kiwifruit.
In a recent laboratory evaluation, latex is the target of a presurgical evaluation, postponing surgical intervention.
The allergy workup was extended with a latex negative prick test, a blood test with IgE 5007 U/mL, specific IgE to kiwi 5,54 kU/L, negative for guava latex 1,1 kU1.
Latex is diagnosed and surgical intervention is performed without complications.
