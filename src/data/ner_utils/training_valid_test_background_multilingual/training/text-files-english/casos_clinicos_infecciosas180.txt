We report the case of a 41-year-old male with a family history of laryngeal carcinoma by his father and personal of type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, both in dietary treatment with loss of 50 kg in the last 10 months, smoker
The patient was seen in the emergency room for presenting a right laterocervical tumor of one month onset as a small forum, accompanied by fever of up to 40oC with sweating and tiritone.
The patient reported weight loss previously mentioned, associated with the change in dietary habits.
He had previously consulted in the emergency room and was referred to outpatient maxillofacial surgery.
FNAC was performed, informed as an acute inflammatory process, so amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initially prescribed 875/125mg every 8 hours.
The absence of improvement on the sixth day of treatment was suspected by clindamycin 600mg every 8 hours, which was maintained for four days until the current visit to the emergency department.
Before the beginning of the current picture, he had a foot trauma with an open wound with a metallic tool, which at the present time was closed, without signs of infection.
On examination, the patient was in good general condition and was eupneic.
Cardiorespiratory arrest was unremarkable.
The patient had a 5x4 cm tumor in the cervical region II, with a stony, non-mobile consistency, adhered to deep planes, without local inflammatory signs.
As for the exploration of the oral cavity, he was in a bad state with great destruction of pieces in the fourth quadrant.
The patient was evaluated by ENT, who underwent fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy, which showed hypertrophy of the lingual tonsil and movement of the vocal cord right to▁inspiration, without other findings.
▁Complementary tests requested from the Emergency Department showed a leukocytosis of 18360 cells/μL with predominance of polymorphonuclear cells and C-reactive protein of 16.85 mg/l.
A CT scan of the neck with intravenous contrast showed a soft tissue density image, poorly delimited, heterogeneous soft tissue with central hypodensity and peripheral enhancement in the right adnexal muscle layer, with subcutaneous soft tissue density in the right side
Contrast-enhanced neck CT: poorly defined image in blade tissues with central hypodensity.
With these findings, together with the results of FNA performed previously, she was admitted to the hospital ward for infectious diseases.
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and▁polyps)
In patients older than 40 years, up to 60% of cases are caused by metastases from adenocarcinoma or lymphoma.
That is why, given the characteristics of the patient and the tumor, it would be the first cause to rule out.
The traumatic etiology includes hematomas and carotid pseudoaneurysms, which usually appear as a soft and pulsatile mass, with an unusual murmur on auscultation, although they are very rare.
The inflammatory and infectious pathology is very wide.
This includes soft tissue infections caused by common germs such as Streptococcus spp.
and Staphylococcus spp., as well as lymphadenopathies that are reactive to viral or bacterial infections of the oropharynx.
Cervical nodules with a subacute or chronic evolution can also manifest as germs of the Actinescents order, which include Corynebacterium spp., Mycobacterium spp., No.
and Propionibacterium spp., the most common etiology among these microorganisms being tuberculosis.
Other options to consider are sialadenitis, toxoplasmosis and cat scratch disease.
Finally, although the diagnosis of congenital malformations usually occurs in childhood, it is not uncommon that they are not detected until adulthood, especially gill cysts or thyroglossal duct superinfection, in the context of infection.
The patients admission to hospital was negative for HIV, syphilis, Toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus and revealed a past infection by Epstein-parevovirus.
Also, interferon-gamma (Quantiferon®) was performed, with a positive titer of 3.85 IU/mL (normal value determination of 35 IU/mL).
A chest X-ray showed no infiltrates, condensations or lesions suggestive of tuberculosis.
A core needle biopsy guided by ultrasound was performed, aspirating 10cc of purulent content that was sent to Microbiology for culture of common germs and mycobacteria, and also to Pathology Anatomy.
Auramine staining revealed no acid-resistant bacilli (BAAR) in the mycobacterial study.
PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was performed, being negative, leaving pending the result culture for mycobacteria.
In Gram stain, abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive▁cocci were observed. Treatment was initiated with trimethoprim doses 8 hours per empirical treatment of betayl alcohol at 4mg a possible dose.
The combined treatment was maintained for 7 days until the culture was received, in which Actinomyces odontolyticus and Streptococcus oralis were isolated, after which cotrimoxazole was suspended and maintained with benzathine.
After the diagnosis of ichthyosis, a drainage of the tumor is performed by Maxillofacial Surgery, with abundant outflow of pus and▁granules due to mucus draining, which remained similar to▁sulfur, characteristic of the infection.
Necrotic material with neutrophilic▁exudate and abundant bacterial colonies were visualized both in the biopsy cytology and in the tissue sample taken during drainage, without identifying tumor cells.
The patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged maintaining home treatment with sodium penicillin G 2MIU every 4 hours programDE (Antibiotic Therapy). Intravenous therapy Endovenous Tract
The patient completed six weeks of intravenous treatment and subsequently underwent four more months of treatment with amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours, with good clinical outcome.
Final diagnosis Achievement of cervicofacial deformities with overinfection by Streptococcus oralis.
