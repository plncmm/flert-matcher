A 14-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of McCunebright syndrome and hyperprolactinemia of the lower limbs, hypothyroidism and altered growth hormone secretion, treated with disodium octreotide, was evaluated.
On physical examination, irregularly shaped macular lesions were observed, with some telangiectasias predominantly on the foot and left ankle, and a purplish puntillage and pruritic region in both feet.
In addition, a color macula with milk in the neck and interscapular region of approximately 3 cm per 10 cm was observed, with clear and irregular edges for coffee, proambulatism and incapacity for walking.
A laboratory routine was requested, which was normal.
The lesions still persist.
