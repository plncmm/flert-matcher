A 42-year-old male traveler, born in Catalonia, who travels for 6 months (first semester of 2001) in South America.
It begins its journey in southern Argentina, later in Chile and Bolivia, ending with 1 month and a half in the Peruvian Amazon, specifically in Iquitos.
She came to the service because she had a 3-week history, which began in Iquitos and for which she was taking antibiotics for a week (cloxacillin).
Physical examination revealed two dorsal forum-like lesions.
Red tumors of 0.5 cm
diameter, with a central hole, which when pressed, drain serous fluid and cause stabbing pain and itching.
Rest of normal examination.
In our case, from the first day of the visit to the day that the extraction was performed, antibiotic treatment was maintained and under suspicion of myiasis, daily occluding the exit wound with vaseline.
Finally, after 10 days, and due to the impossibility of natural exit of the larva, the patient was submitted to local anesthesia with a small incision in the entrance orifice to the natural extraction of the larva, identified as alive.
