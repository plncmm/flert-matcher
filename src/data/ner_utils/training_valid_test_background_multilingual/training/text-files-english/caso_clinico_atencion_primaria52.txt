Establishment and consultation. Patient's mother comes to the health center by providing a closed closed stool containing stools, including an elongated foreign body, 21 cm thick, flat, non segmented container.
The foreign body has been examined personally by the patient during the defecation, after placing an enema, previously showing a sphere composed of extended bodies childhood blances, called individual paralysis of minor tama.
Life bed-illion, totally dependent, for her 88-year-old mother.
Approved the law of identity.
Usual treatment: clorazepate 5 mg/12h, clonazepam 2mg/12h, clozapine 15mg/24h, levodopa/carbidopa 25mg/8h.
Current disease: 59-year-old male consulting his GP for pathological products in the stool.
Has a heavy habit, you need clean enemas assiduously.
Physical discomfort.
The patient was clinically and hemodynamically stable.
Good hydration and perfusion of skin and mucous membranes
Eupneic at rest.
Do not jugular engorgement.
Simetric Pairs.
No lower limb edema.
Abdomen blushing, depressible, not palpable masses or enlargements.
Painless fixation
No signs of peritoneal irritation.
Location: bilateral negative impact.
Analytical: blood count with hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, hematocrit of▁37.6%, mean corpuscular volume 97.7 fL, leukocytes abnormal bilirubin/mm3 (PMN 2360/mm, normal blood glucose level 3.13000 g 5.53; normal serum triglycerides)
Stool culture: Microbiology is sent as a presupposition, finally becoming " intestinal mucosa remnants associated with plant debris".
Family and community approach Mebendazole is administered to the patient and their relatives 100 mg, single dose, to be repeated within 2 weeks, on a provisional basis and pending a definitive diagnosis by the Microbiology.
Measures are taken to clean the environment and the home.
Clinical judgement (problem finding, differential diagnosis) Parasitosis (tricuriasis, tenia) vs. remnants of mucosa and vegetables (false tapeworm).
Pancreatic or hepatic insufficiency: steatorrhea and intact muscle fibers.
Food intolerance: gluten, celiac.
Non-parasitic gastrointestinal infections.
Plan of action and evolution Mebendazole 100 mg, single dose, was administered as an empirical treatment for tricuriasis, although morphologically it could be more similar to tenia.
We expect microbiological diagnosis to add or not erradication treatment against nematode vs. platelminto, and finally discarding parasitosis, since we found it necessary to administer a decreased base to a patient with intestinal transit.
The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and stools.
