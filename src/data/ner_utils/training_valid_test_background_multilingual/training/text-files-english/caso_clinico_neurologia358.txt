Anamnesis A 28-year-old male, Israeli natural bailarin, with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 2008 without current treatment, occasional cocaine and alcohol consumption.
She was admitted to Internal Medicine due to a clinical picture of paresthesias in the right hemibody and visual impairment after previous consumption of 1 g of cocaine.
Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an acute ischemic lesion in the posterior territory (left thalamus).
The study was completed with a cerebral MR angiography, which showed no findings.
A viral load of 200,000 copies and CD4 647 cells were observed.
She was discharged with a right upper quadrant tenderness as a sequel and treatment with statin.
Two weeks later, the patient came to the emergency department complaining of a new episode of right facial and hemicorporeal hemihypoesthesia.
Physical examination upon arrival to the emergency room revealed arterial tension 120mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm,▁malaise.
The general examination by equipment was normal.
Neurological examination showed the presence of a right upper quadrantnopsia (sleep), right hemifacial algesic hypoesthesia in the second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve, and right upper limb dysmetria.
The rest of the examination was normal.
Additional tests • Blood count: normal with adequate leukocyte formula, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 46 mm/h.
• Biochemistry: lactate dehydrogenase 722 IU/l (230-460), transferrin descent, thyroid hormones altered (TSH 5.36 μIU (0.5-4.77), T3l 2.73.
Proteinogram: weak monoclonal peak in the gamma area.
• Coagulation and thrombophilia study: minimum elevation of fibrinogen and free protein S deficiency, the rest being normal (including protein C, lupus anticoagulant, Leyden factor V and antithrombin).
• Autoimmunity: weakly positive anticardiolipin IgG antibodies (22.6 UGPL/ml), negative IgM ANCA, negative immunocomplexes rheumatoid factor, ANA, anti-DNA, anti-B2
• Serology: positive EBV IgG, positive hepatitis A IgG; Treponema, toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C negative.
HIV-1 viral load: 177,930 copies; CD4 432 cells/μl, non-resistance to antiretrovirals.
• Electrocardiogram and 48-hour monitoring: sinus rhythm, known right bundle branch block.
• Chest radiography and transthoracic echocardiography were normal.
• Cranial CT shows irregular hypodense lesions in the left occipital parasagittal region and in the white matter of the left temporal lobe, compatible with subacute-chronic ischemic lesions.
• The new brain MRI shows the appearance of a new focal lesion in the hyperintense left thalamus in long RT and marked diffusion restriction, suggesting acute-subacute ischemia.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted sequence: acute ischemic lesion in the left thalamus.
• Intracranial MRA was repeated, which determined the absence of visualization of the left PCA from its origin, the right being permeable.
Magnetic resonance angiography: no visualization of the left-sided-PCA since its beginning.
Patent ACP-right.
• Lumbar puncture: glucose 49 mg/dl, protein 66 mg/dl, leukocytes 40/mm3 (80% mononuclear) and white lesions /mm3.
Culture: negative for bacteria and mycobacteria, polymerase chain reaction of enterovirus and herpes simplex 1 and 2 negative; VDRL negative; cytology: acellular sample.
Diagnosis Recurrent cerebral ischemia probably related to HIV-associated vasculopathy.
Hypergammaglobulinemia, protein S deficiency, weakly positive anticardiolipin IgG antibodies.
Treatment and evolution Antiretroviral therapy was initiated with darunavir, ritonavir and tenofovir plus emtricitabine and antiaggregation with▁acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, after which no new episodes have recurred, with mild ataxia persisting in the right upper limb.
