We report the case of a three-year-old pre-school who came to his health center for presenting, for one month, bitemporal, daily headache, evening headache, lasting hours, analgesia after collapsing.
Pain does not appear during sleep or interferes with your daily activity.
It does not present aura, sonophobia or photophobia.
It is not associated with vomiting or other symptoms.
Personal history of no interest.
Psychomotor and well-height development were normal.
Physical and neurological findings were normal.
She was referred to Ophthalmology, where pathology was ruled out.
Blood tests were performed, highlighting ferritin, 8 ng/ml, with complete blood count and other anodyne biochemistry.
After this, treatment with oral iron is initiated.
Two months later, the patient consulted due to persistent headache, which led to the development of a neurotransmitter (normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and an analytical control was performed to assess IgA severing antibodies).
Subsequently, a confirmatory biopsy of celiac disease with villous vesicles in Marsh type IIIII was obtained, and a histocompatibility system (human leukocyte antigenQ2 ) typification of low resolution was performed, obtaining cell susceptibility.
After the diagnosis, the patient was started on a diet containing gluten, with a favorable evolution, with disappearance of the headache and correction of the ferritin levels.
