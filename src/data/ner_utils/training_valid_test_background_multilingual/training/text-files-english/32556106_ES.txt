A 51-year-old man complained of fever, arthromyalgia, dyspnea and atypical chest pain, but without cough or anosmia/agenesis.
Troponin I values were 200 ng/mL, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 900 pg/mL, C-reactive protein 270 mg/L and fibrinogen > 10 g/L.
The ECG showed nonspecific changes in the T wave. The echocardiogram did not yield relevant results.
Acute mycositis was diagnosed.
Two PCR tests were performed for COVID-19 from nasopharyngeal swabs within 48 hours, along with a chest CT, and in both cases the result was negative for diagnosis of COVID-19.
Serological tests showed previous infections by parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Pugh virus.
Other tests were negative (HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, Coxsackie, HSV1, HSV2, VZV, RSV and influenza virus).
8 days after the onset of symptoms a cardiac MRI was performed which showed subepicardial edema in the left ventricular wall (LV) lateral/posterior, with late enhancement with acute gadolinium, consistent with inferior myxitis.
A radiokinamatography showed maintenance of LVEF and volumes, no changes were observed in parietal motion but a 5 mm thrombus was observed in the tip of the LV.
The atypical finding of a thrombus despite an unaltered LVEF and clear biological signs of inflammation were assessed as uncommon and, consequently, serological tests for COVID-19 were performed.
The results were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in IgG and IgM.
The patient was treated with tocilizumab.
