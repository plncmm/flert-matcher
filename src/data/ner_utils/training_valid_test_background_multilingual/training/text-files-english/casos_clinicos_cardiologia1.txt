ANTECE DESIGN: A 77-year-old woman, allergic to metamizole, with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (insulin dependent), permanent atrial fibrillation, and bronchial asthma.
The patient was followed up by cardiology for rheumatic mitral valve disease with severe mitral stenosis treated by surgical commissurotomy in 1991 and later valve replacement protuber 2007 with metallic prosthesis Carbomedics no 27.
During follow-up she also developed a non-symptomatic severe valvular heart disease. She was being treated with acenocoumarol, bisoprolol, aortic furadilators, stenosis, bronchoolmesart.
BACKGROUND: The patient came to the emergency room for colic abdominal pain and fever of 38.2 °C, with acute gastroenteritis that was resolved by conservative treatment.
Five days later he returned to our hospital with a new fever peak and abdominal pain localized in the left iliac fossa that required hospitalization due to suspected acute diverticulitis.
Bad breakgilis was isolated in two hemocultives and antibiotic treatment was initiated with good outcome.
Twenty days later, he was admitted again due to a new fever peak with positive blood cultures for the same pathogen. An abdominal CT was performed to rule out infective endocarditis (IE without signs of acute infection, so the echocardiogram showed that data).
PHYSICAL EXPLORATION Temperature 38.3 oC.
Arterial hypertension 105/70 mmHg.
Heart rate 68 bpm.
Aware, oriented, well perfused.
No Osler nodules or Roth spots were observed on the skin.
Increased jugular venous pulse with venous pulse under the angle of the jaw at 90o with prominent "v" waves.
Cardiac arrest: cardiac rhythmic noises to lpm with systolic murmur3/6 in focus and second abolished noise irradiating to the left and apex border.
Pulmonary consolidation: left basal hypoventilation.
No edemas in the lower limbs.
ANALYTICAL COMPLEARY BAIMS upon admission: 0.36 g/l, creatinine 0.73 mg/dl; CKD-EPI 79.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, with no significant changes in urea and transaminase.
NT-proBNP 2.797 pg/ml.
VSG 102 mm, Creative protein 0.81 mg/dl.
Blood count: Hb 10.2 g/dl, Hto 30%, 13.900/mm3 (neutrophils 91.1%).
TORAX RADIGRAPHY: radiological cardiomegaly.
Her terminal half-life.
Puncture of both costophrenic sinuses (degree on the left side).
Prominent vascular hilii.
HEMOCULTIVOS (x3): positive for Baoides fragilis.
TRANSESOPHAL ECOCIOGRAPHY: severe left atrium.
Complete septum: an image-occupied small echodense thrombus was observed.
Double-hemi-disk mitral prosthesis with good opening (gradients to previous studies); several jets of intraprosthetic regurgitation are observed without inversion of the envenomation.
Two vegetative images were observed in the pro- and pro-unit melanomas. x 3 mm and 10 x 3 mm mobile images did not interfere with disc movement. Periannular abscesses were not detected.
The left ventricle was neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved ejection fraction and without segmental alterations.
Aortic valve was trivalvular, thickened, with significantly reduced effective area; without resurgence.
▁Right ventricular septal defects; reduced right ventricular▁contractility (TAPSE 14 mm).
Thickened tricuspid valve with good opening and mobility; severe regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No pericardial effusion was observed.
▁CLINICAL EVOLUTION With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis on prosthetic valve by Baoides fragilis, treatment with metronidazole 500 mg/8 hours and amoxicillin-clavulanate 1000 mg/200mg was started
The patients admission to hospital was inadequate, and hemocultives were negative in an early stage, but the patients slight cardiac defect was treated conservatively.
After 6 weeks of directed intravenous antibiotic treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable and in good functional class was discharged.
DIAGNOSIS Endocrinitis on a metallic prosthetic mitral prosthesis due to anaerobic bacteria (Barium fragilis) without associated prosthetic dysfunction.
Bacteriemia due to Badoides fragilis of possible gastrointestinal origin.
Diverticulosis without diverticulosis
