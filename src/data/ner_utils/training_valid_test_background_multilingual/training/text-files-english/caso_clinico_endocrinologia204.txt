We present the case of an 18-year-old female patient with ambulatory analytical control, where glycemia of 189 mg/dL was detected, without other biochemical alteration.
The patient did not refer personal history of Diabetes Mellitus, as well as any other known autoimmune or endocrine disease.
We highlight intrauterine growth retardation, short stature that required follow-up by Pediatrics with treatment by growth hormone up to 16 years of age, and detection of renal and hepatic cysts diagnosed at 4 years of age.
The examination revealed a BMI of 21 kg/m2, with no evidence of sound of interest.
After analytical finding, a study was completed with an HbA1c result of 6.20% and Oral Glucose Burden with 75 g with pathological results at 2 hours (209 mg/dL).
A negative pancreatic autoimmunity (AI2 and anti-GAD < 1 U/mL), HOMA 1.90, Insulin 8.2 uUI/mL and Peptide C 2.15 ng/mL patient reported oral diabetes history.
The presence of men in this family branch of multiple cysts, without having been studied, located in the head and neck and polycystic ovary syndrome in the mother's sister.
No history of cardiovascular disease by paternal branch.
Associated renal abnormalities were identified, we considered it appropriate to rule out monogenic diabetes, specifically hepatic nuclear transcription factor 1Î² (HNF 1beta) mutation: MODY type 5.
