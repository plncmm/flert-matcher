A 33-year-old woman with secondary amenorrhea due to a normal pituitary profile and previous episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease was studied.
Since the hormonal profile was completely normal and did not deprive high-dose hormonal treatment, endometrial origin of amenorrhea was diagnosed.
There is no drug allergy or other medical history of interest.
The genital examination revealed a vaginal ulcer, periorificial bleeding ulcer with cervical necrosis and non-pathological leukorrhea.
Pathological examination of the endometrium was performed to study cultures of the vaginal ulcer.
She came to Internal Medicine consultation with numerous▁lymphocytic infiltration of the endometrium without finding the pathological result of endometrial biopsy (see accompanying image): fragments of endometrial mucosa in which an epithelium with an initial giant granulomatous pattern was observed.
The study with special techniques (Zhiel-Neelsen) has not shown the existence of acid-resistant bacterial organisms; with a conclusive pathological diagnosis of granulomatous endometritis.
Treatment was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and etambu, pending the results of Mantoux and mycobacterial culture in a vaginal sample.
The patient remains asymptomatic, but continues with amenorrhea.
Subsequently, the results of Mantoux (15 mm) and mycobacterial culture were obtained in a vaginal sample positive for Mycobacterium bovis sensitive to streptomycin, etambuco, isoniazid and rifampicin, and pyrazinamide-resistant.
Therefore, pyrazinamide was discontinued, leaving the patient with 3 drugs with a total duration of 9 months.
Mycobacterium bovis also grew in the culture medium of Löstein-Jensen.
After antibiotic treatment, resolution of endometritis and granulomatous vaginitis by Mycobacterium bovis was resolved and the patient has evolved satisfactorily
