Anamnesis A 39-year-old woman, with a stable heterosexual partner, came to the consultation referred from her primary care physician for genital lesions of several months duration.
As personal history, only ampicillin allergy was highlighted.
She did not take drugs regularly and did not report any previous history of genital lesions.
Physical examination revealed multiple▁papules measuring between 0.5 and 1.5 cm on a flat surface, pinkish hue and moist appearance, with a tendency to ulceration.
The lesions were located mainly in the labia majora, perineum and perianal region.
There were no lesions in other locations of skin or mucosa.
▁Complementary laboratory tests showed positivity for luetic serology, with a positive RPR, with titer 1/128 and a TPHA (Ac.
Anti Treponema
The remaining serologies, including hepatitis B virus (HBs Ag and Anti HBcAb), hepatitis C virus (Ac Anti HCV) and HIV (Ac Anti HIV) were negative.
Skin biopsy of one of the lesions showed a very dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and very abundant plasma cells in the dermal level.
The epidermis showed acanthosis and▁patches of parakeratosis, with abundant neutrophils.
In the superficial layers of the epidermis, the presence of▁eosinophils, neutrophils and isolated lymphocytes was observed.
Plasma cells of the infiltrate showed no light chain restriction and numerous spirochetes were observed in the most basal layers of the epidermis by antitreponema antibodies.
Diagnosis Flat condyloma, secondary syphilis.
Treatment and evolution 2.4 million IU of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine were administered in a single dose.
The case was reported to the preventive medicine service of our hospital because it is a notifiable disease.
However, the patient did not return for review despite repeated attempts to locate it, as well as her usual partner, so the follow-up was lost.
