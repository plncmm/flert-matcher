Anamnesis A 46-year-old woman, with no known adverse drug reactions, ex-smoker, hypertensive under treatment with 5 mg/day of rhamipryl (with good control) and dyslipemia in dietetic treatment since 2006
In September 2008, progressive clumsiness began to be seen in the left lower limb.
Since then, he stopped driving because he did not notice the pedal, and when descending stairs he had to look where he supports so he could not fall down.
He has suffered several sprains.
She also says that when she eats she has to press the objects and look at them so that she can take them correctly to her mouth.
Denies loss of strength.
alternate episodes of diarrhoea with constipation, dry mouth and generalised arthralgias
Physical examination revealed normal fundoscopy.
Higher functions preserved
Not campimetry defects by confrontation.
Middle reactive light.
Persecution ocular movements and normal saccades.
Return of normal cranial nerves
Normal balance, tone and muscle tone.
Liability: hypoesthesia and hypoalgesia in the left upper limb up to the upper third of the forearm and in the left lower limb up to the proximal third of the thigh with dysesthesia sensations.
Vibratory findings in the left hand and knee fingers were normal in the right limbs.
The mass was normal in the right limbs.
No detachment.
Generalised arreflexia except hypoactive right tricipital.
Cutaneous-plantar bilateral flexor contracture.
Pseudoathetosis in the left upper limb.
No dysmetria.
Walking with base increase and pseudo-systemic posture in the left lower limb.
Tándem.
Positive Romberg (fall in 5 seconds)
Cardiorespiratory arrest: approximately 65 systoles/minute.
No cardiac or laterocervical murmurs were auscultated.
Not other airborne noises.
▁Complementary tests • Blood tests: normal including vitamin B12 and folic acid.
• HIV serology, syphilis and negative liver markers
• Antineurals and old congenital syphilis negatives
• ANA, antigliadin and antitransglutaminase negative.
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): normal cytobiochemistry.
Serology negative.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull and cervical-dorsal-lumbar region: normal.
• ENG: decreased amplitudes of sensory action potentials predominantly in the left limbs, being absent in the left lower limb, preserving conduction velocities.
Motor action potentials are normal.
F waves have normal characteristics and latencies.
The H response on the left side to the soleus is abolished and a very low amplitude response is obtained on the right side.
• Toco-abdominal computed tomography (CT): normal.
• Positron emission tomography (PET): normal.
• Schirmer test: pathological (< 10 mm).
Lachrymal hyposecretion
• Salivary gland biopsy: no histological changes.
• Subral nerve biopsy: axonal degeneration, regeneration cluster and loss of myelinated fibers were observed.
Asymmetric non-determined etiology Neuronopathy Diagnosis.
Possible Sjögren's disease.
Treatment Treatment Treatment was initiated with prednisone at a rate of 1 mg/kg of weight.
The patients clinical worsening worsened during the 7-year follow-up period, without progression being served to improve or prevent the disease.
There is increasing difficulty in manipulating objects or▁bending, and much difficulty in handling left-sided dementia.
The patient still complains of significant ocular and oral dryness, which forces her to drink large amounts of water a day.
