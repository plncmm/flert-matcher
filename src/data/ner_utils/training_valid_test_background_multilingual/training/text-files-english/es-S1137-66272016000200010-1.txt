We report the case of a 68-year-old man with no relevant history and asymptomatic from the digestive point of view.
She was admitted to the emergency department with a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT).
The rest of the blood tests, as well as the physical examination, showed no findings of interest.
An ileocecal valve was placed in which an ulcerated lesion at the cecum level was observed. This lesion was compatible with a malignant neoplasm and multiple biopsies were taken.
These showed ulcerated tissue without appreciating tumor cells.
The diagnostic suspicion was completed by a CT scan, which showed thickening in the cecum wall and ascending colon with no data of lymph node or distant involvement.
Tumor markers were normal.
Given the negativity found in the samples, it was decided to repeat the diagnosis, taking again biopsies, which were also negative for malignancy.
Biopsies were taken from the first stage. Granuloma with presence of multinucleated giant cells and mycobacterial bacilli with Ziehl Nielsen stain were observed.
The patient was admitted to the outpatient▁Pneumology service, but did not present respiratory symptoms.
The Mantoux test was negative, but Quantiferon® was positive (value: 5.12).
Chest X-ray showed a nodular infiltrate in both upper lung fields.
Sputum samples were collected, which were not bacilliferous, and samples were sent for culture, which were negative.
PCR of colon samples was also negative.
Standard anti-tuberculous treatment was established with good clinical outcome.
Six months after the end of the treatment, a control loop was performed which was normal.
