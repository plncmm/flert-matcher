A 72-year-old man with no relevant past medical history presented left hemiparesis, altered mental status and sudden onset of resistant epilepsy.
Retroactively, the patient's family reported mild respiratory symptoms a few days earlier.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and negative for influenza A and B and adenovirus.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an increase in erythrocyte count (500/mm3) due to traumatic lumbar puncture and apleocytosis (30 leukocytes/mm3).
RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus Epstein-LCR and bacterial cultures were negative.
An unenhanced CT scan showed severe right hemispheric hypodensity with some hyperdense areas affecting the thalamus, basal‚ñÅganglia, internal capsule and splenium of the corpus callosum.
A slight hypodensity could also be seen in the left thalamus.
These changes caused a moderate mass effect on the medial structures.
Among the scattered areas of parenchymal hemorrhage, spontaneous hyperdensity was detected in deep cerebral veins and in the great cerebral vein.
A CT phlebogram showed no opacification of these veins, confirming the diagnosis of acute deep cerebral venous thrombosis complicated by hemorrhagic venous infarction.
