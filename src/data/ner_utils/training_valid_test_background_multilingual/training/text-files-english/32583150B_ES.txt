A two-month-old boy with a history of congenital malformations requiring a colonoscopy.
The patient presented with respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and bilateral pneumothorax.
She developed resistant respiratory failure and was administered emergency ECMO, which lasted 8 days.
Despite the clinical picture and high IL-6 values, it was negative in a COVID-19 antibody test.
A continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) determined that the child was in epiconvulsive non-convulsive state, which was controlled with four drugs.
Having established the protocol for ECMO, daily cranial ultrasounds were performed.
On day 1 of ECMO, a cranial ultrasound showed multifocal echocardiography suspecting hemorrhage.
A follow-up CT scan revealed bilateral infarctions in the middle cerebral artery and in the posterior cerebral artery, with hemorrhagic transformation.
The patient continued with poor seizure control, which required several weeks of intermittent EEG and adjustment of antiepileptic medication, including continuous administration of fenobarbital and midazolam.
The MRI revealed infarcts in evolution in the occipital and left lobes temporal and frontal and bilateral subdural groups, whose etiologywas hemorrhagic lobes stable bilateral.
At these times, assisted breathing is gradually being progressively removed.
