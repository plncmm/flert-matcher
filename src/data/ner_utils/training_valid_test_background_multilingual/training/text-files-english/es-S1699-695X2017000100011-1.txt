The patient is a 12-year-old male who was the result of a term delivery using forceps for stationary dilatation.
The Apgar score and other postpartum examinations were normal.
Rest was indicated during the last trimester of pregnancy due to threatened delivery.
During the postnatal period she presented delayed psychomotor development.
At 3 years she presented absence seizures without subsequent‚ñÅepileptic seizures or need for treatment.
Presently, she presents moderate mental retardation, learning difficulties, severe behavioral alterations in the autism spectrum, sphincter control deficit and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, treated first with antioxidant methylphenidate, and later on she is treated with antioxidants.
It also presents social anxiety and phobias to noise and animals, hypersensitivity to sounds, textures and certain foods, as well as difficulties in chewing and secondary generalized hypotonia valgus feet treated with extreme nausea and vomiting, which have been treated.
There are no cardiac, dysautonomic or characteristic facial features.
The patient has a healthy older brother, but has a second episode due to the maternal branch of 33 years diagnosed at 13 years of age with FXS after genetic testing.
At that time, the entire maternal family branch was genetically studied and oral meetings were held, without written report, that both the mother of the case patient and her sisters were healthy carriers.
This condition was not sufficiently valued by the family in successive healthy children of the sisters and the healthy brother of the case patient.
The mother of the case patient did not receive genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis indications in any of her two pregnancies.
Genetic analysis was performed only in the postnatal period in both cases upon request.
