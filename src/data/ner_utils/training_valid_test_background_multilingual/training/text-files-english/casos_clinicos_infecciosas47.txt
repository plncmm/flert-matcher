A 21-year-old woman from India, residing in Spain since she was two years old, with no personal history of interest, who consulted the Emergency Department one month before, after returning from travel to India for a pathological fever 39.5°C.
The patient did not present any associated respiratory or urinary symptoms, although she reported mild abdominal pain.
The trip had family/related reasons, married, with a stay of 6 months mainly in the state of Rajas (Northetinente de alimentar del Subcontinente concertado), in the rural zone friends and family members, according to guinea eating habits

He did not bathe rivers or lakes.
Physical examination revealed 100 mm Hg arterial pressure (TA) with a heart rate (HR) at 100 beats per minute (lpm) and a Ta of 39 °C.
The abdomen was not distended, with normal air-fluid sounds, and minimal pain in the right iliac fossa with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
The rest of the physical examination was normal.
Analytically, the patient presented altered hepatic biochemistry pattern.
C-reactive protein (CRP) was 67 mg/l.
Blood count showed 12000 leukocytes/ mm3 with neutrophilia (polymorphonuclear 78%) and Hb 6.5 g/l (MCV 82 fL, MCH 30 pG).
The remaining parameters including renal function, platelet count and coagulation study were normal.
An abdominal X-ray was performed in the supine position, with no relevant findings, and an abdominal ultrasound showed a homogeneous abnormality.
The thick blood smear and peripheral blood smears did not show signs of infection.
An urgent pregnancy test was performed with a positive result, so that the gynecological examination was performed at a Maternal Hospital, confirming a pregnancy with fetus without signs of viability, so after fluid and electrolyte replacement and uterine blood transfusion.
The subsequent clinical evolution was not favorable with persistent fever, diarrhea and decreased level of consciousness, so it was decided to start empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, with suspicion of sepsis after curettage.
However, in the absence of response, it was decided to consult with Infectious Diseases.
Differential diagnosis Diarrhoea of more than three weeks of evolution,- with short duration fever, recent history of travel to tropical area, type of travel performed, the situation of immunosuppression induced by the initial broad-spectrum approach to pregnancy and the key
Diarrhea after travel to the tropics is the most common reason for visiting travelers' pathology care centers.
The most common microorganisms of bacterial origin are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp and Salmonella spp.
Other agents to be considered are: Norovirus, Rovirus, Giardia lactasis, Entamoeba histolytica and Cyclotaspora.
Most of them give rise to acute episodes, which manifest in the first two weeks of their acquisition, self-limited and with good response to etiological treatment, if necessary.
In this patient, the duration of symptoms is unlikely to be due to the most common bacterial microorganisms.
All of them should have responded to the antibiotic treatment initiated.
The viral etiology is ruled out by the duration of the symptoms.
The type of non-inflammatory diarrhea is unlikely to be Entamoeba histolytica.
Therefore, the parasitic origin is more likely, which should be ruled out by studying feces.
However, the stenosis was observed, as well as the CRP values, not initially with the possibility of parasitic etiology.
Severe anemia at admission, with no evidence of external bleeding, together with the chronicity of the condition, could indicate infection of long evolution, or chronic intestinal loss not evident.
Given the high rate of infection by Salmonella tiphy in the country, the possibility of fever with microbleeding of Peyer's plates should be considered, a diagnosis that would justify intestinal hypertrophy due to Salmonella tiphy associated.
However, typhoid fever usually presents as an acute systemic condition that is not consistent with the chronicity of the clinical picture in this patient.
Also, scleroderma is not a specific data and there are numerous infectious causes, such as non-infectious, which can justify it.
Unprotected sex makes it necessary to rule out HIV infection with opportunistic infection associated with germs such as Cryptosporidium or Cyclospora.
Finally, it should be borne in mind that pregnancy induces cellular immunosuppression, which may facilitate infections by uncommon germs such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
sputum culture results were negative and all of them were requested as part of the diagnostic study microbiological: coprocultive in which Salmonella non-typhi was isolated (S. enteritidis, R to nalix16 feces).
Serological studies including HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV, Coxiella burnetti, Ritsia connori and Brucella melitensis were negative.
The hydroelectrolytic supply was intensified and a progressive oral diet was initiated with a favorable evolution: self-limiting of the diarrheic picture became gradually decreased in the analytical phase (RF0/control) at 5 days after the start of antibiotic therapy.
Based on the isolation in▁faeces, clinical and analytical improvement, together with the absence of clinical signs suggestive of septic process, it was decided to interrupt empirical antibiotic therapy 7 days after the beginning.
After 48 hours of clinical observation, she was discharged for follow-up in outpatient clinics with a diagnosis of "acute gastroenteritis due to non-typhi Salmonella" on chronic diarrhea after travel to the tropics due to microbiological abortion and spontaneous abortion.
Fifteen days later she was admitted again due to persistent diarrhea, asthenia, low oral intake and fever of up to 40 °C, with a tendency to sleep.
On admission, the patient presented TA 90/40 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm and Ta 39.8°C.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented, although prone to sleep.
The rest of the neurological and cardiorespiratory examination was normal.
The abdomen was blushing and not distended, with abundant peristaltic noise and painful to selective peristaltic fixation in the RIF, with no signs of peritoneal irritation or hepatomegaly.
The rectal examination showed an empty rectal ampulla, with no residual bleeding.
There were no palpable lymph nodes or skin changes.
Chest X-ray showed a proyelocalizing and lateral chest X-ray without abnormalities.
Blood tests showed creatinine 1.22 mg/dl, urea 46 mg/dl, K 2.5 mEq/l, Na 125 mEq/L, CRP 116 mg/l, amylase 200 IU/l, GOT 520 IU/l
Total leukocyte count was 10,000/mm3 with 600 lymphocytes/mm3.
The blood count showed mild anemia 12.7 g/l with platelets and coagulation in normal range.
The ultrasound study showed no changes compared to the previous one.
Blood cultures were obtained in which Salmonella typhi was isolated (R to Nalidixic Acid, MIC >16 mg/ml), so antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated for 14 days.
The isolation of two distinct subtypes of the same species, in two consecutive admissions, in a short period of time and without clinical improvement, led to the typing of Salmonella coprocultiva from the first admission performed with MALDITOF.
Despite intravenous antibiotic treatment, for two weeks with negative blood cultures at 5 days, the patient did not improve with daily fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
The diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis in the first admission did not justify the clinical chronology of the condition.
Isolation of Salmonella tiphy in hemocultives allowed correcting the initial diagnosis, which, however, did not explain all the symptoms present, both for the duration and the lack of response to treatment with ceftriaxone.
Although acquired resistance to third generation cephalosporins is a possibility, they are extremely rare.
Therefore, two options were proposed: co-infection by an unidentified germ or expansion of the study to non-infectious causes, among which neoplasic processes such as inflammatory neuroendocrine disease or autoimmune lymphoma should be ruled out.
In this sense, the implementation of a diagnostic approach was proposed.
Reinterrupting and deepening the anamnesis, the patient reported a loss of approximately 20 kg of weight in the last 3 months, with a current BMI of 23.9 kg/m2 (previous BMI of 31.2 kg/m2).
He also had a nocturnal professation prior to the onset of diarrhea, which he interpreted as a fever that he had never yet had.
Finally, the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-porcultive was reported from the Microbiology Laboratory in the stool sample obtained at the first hospital admission (22 days before).
Treatment was initiated with standard regimen of Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R) and Pirazinamide (Z) (Rifater ®), weight-adjusted.
One week later, the patient presented evident improvement in general and nutritional status, with worsening of diarrhea and abdominal pain, so it was not considered necessary to perform the pain management.
The patient received a total of 2 months with HRZ regimen and 7 months of HR, with periodic visits to external consultations, favorable evolution, negative coprocultive one month of treatment, and no evidence of extratestinal involvement.
Final diagnosis Intestinal tuberculosis and typhoid fever and protein calorie malnutrition associated.
