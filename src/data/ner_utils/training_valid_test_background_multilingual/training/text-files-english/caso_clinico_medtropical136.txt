Personal history A 24-year-old male, born in Morocco and residing in Spain for two years, with no trips after his country.
Active smoker of twenty cigarettes/day, with no other relevant background.
Current disease The patient had a previous hospitalization in September 2003, due to a two-month history of cough, without other accompanying symptoms.
On the day before the current admission, the patient presented with▁frank hemoptysis and chest pain.
Physical examination No relevant findings.
▁Complementary findings Complete blood count and coagulation tests were normal.
The general biochemistry (including renal and hepatic immunoglobulins, total proteins, and serum immunoglobulins) was normal, sedimentation rate was 62 mm/h and CRP was 5.4 mg/L.
Antinuclear antibodies were negative.
Basal arterial gas was also normal.
Mantoux intradermal reaction was negative.
HIV serology was negative.
Sputum culture showed normal oropharyngeal flora and smears were taken that were negative.
The chest X-ray showed a left parahilar mass and the chest CT showed a mass in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe of 5x4 cm in diameter, with poorly defined contours, heterogeneous content with cavitation.
Bronchoscopy showed a hard whitish formation that appeared through the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, oscillated with respiratory movements and partially occluded the bronchus.
The surrounding bronchial mucosa was normal.
Microbiology samples were taken (aerobes culture culture and isolation of bacilli resistant acid-fast bacilli), whose result was negative, although culture of mycobacteria), and biopsy (chronic absence of active fragments of fibrin).
The patients condition persisted with moderate hemoptysis, without fever or constitutional symptoms and with a conserved general state.
After the biopsy of the mass, he developed an alveolar infiltrate in the left upper lobe with respiratory failure (compatible with obstructive pneumonitis), which improved clinically and radiologically with broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy (imipenem and tobra).
The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of a mass in the left upper lobe under study, moderate hemoptysis, obstructive pneumonitis, nosocomial respiratory infection and acute respiratory failure resolved.
No specific treatment was prescribed after discharge.
In November 2003, the result of the culture of mycobacteria from the initial sputum was obtained, in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated, initiating anti-pyrazinamide treatment with rifampicin and four drugs (ambuiszin).
In the susceptibility study it was later confirmed that the strain was sensitive to all first-line drugs.
The clinical evolution after the beginning of treatment was favorable, with normalization of acute phase reactants.
However, after completing six months of correct treatment (2HRZE + 4HR), with good adherence, the patient continued with moderate intermittent hemoptysis and persistence of the mass in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe of similar size CT scan.
A new analytical control detected high levels of ACE (83 IU/L), maintaining the blood count values within normal limits (without anemia despite intermittent hemoptysis and without leukocytosis).
In this context, a new fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy was performed, with similar findings to previous biopsy of the mass structures, an organized and compact mucoid material, in which few▁eosinophils stand out, without recognizing the presence of▁eosinophils.
Diagnostic test An open loop ileotomy was performed, in which the mass was found to be a hydatid cyst.
Clinical judgement Active pulmonary tuberculosis.
Simultaneous pulmonary hydatidosis.
