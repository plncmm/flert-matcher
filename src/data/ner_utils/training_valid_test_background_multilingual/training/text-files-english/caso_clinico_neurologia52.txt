Anamnesis A 44-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of headache and fever.
As the only personal history of interest 5 years ago, she presented a complete ductal carcinoma affecting the breast, stage pT2N0M0, which was treated by means of tumorectomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and remission after that, and
As a relevant family history, she lived with a sister who had been treated for 26 years with pulmonary tuberculosis.
He is still being treated with triptorelin (GRH analogue) and exemestane (ineffective aromatase cure).
The current history begins 2 weeks before the patient comes to the emergency department, when she begins with a fever that becomes in the last days in fever of up to 39.5 oC, associated with a predominant headache holcranon-occipital region pain scale.
You have also had nausea and vomiting with food.
He denies any symptoms suggestive of neurological focality, as well as any other systemic symptoms in the anamnesis by devices.
Physical restraint general: temperature 38.9 °C, blood pressure 130 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm.
No other changes of interest.
Neurological features: slight▁rigidity of the neck, with negative Kig and Brudzinski signs.
Normal rectum.
▁Complementary tests • Analytical studies (basic biochemistry, complete blood count, coagulation study) were performed in the Emergency Department, but showed no alterations except for LDH levels of 201 IU/l, with CRP < 0.3 mg/dl and procalciton.
• Cranial computed tomography (CT) was normal; chest X-ray and systematic urine were also normal.
• Lumbar puncture was performed with opening pressure of 300 mm H2O, without blocks and clear cerebrospinal fluid output.
The result of the cytobiochemical study was 50 leukocytes/mm3 (15% polymorphonucleated, 85% mononucleated), proteins zero 1.26/mm3, glucose 21 mg/dl (capillary glycemia 133 mg/dl).
• The rest of the study was obtained during the patient's admission, of which the most relevant was the culture of positive CSF for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex sensitive to streptomycin, ethamphea, rifampicin, isoniazid.
• CSF interferon gamma: 166 pg/ml.
• PCR for mycobacteria, ESR and enterovirus in CSF: negative.
• Bacterial culture in CSF: negative.
• Negative CSF cytology for malignant cells.
• Lues CSF serology, Borrelia, Brucella and Cryptococcus neoformans: negative.
• Fluorescence dyes and cultures of mycobacteria in sputum and urine: negative.
• Serology in serum/plasma of HIV, HCV, HBV, loes, Brucella, Toxoplasma: negative.
• Mantoux test: negative.
• Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast: leptomeningeal uptake in both cerebral hemispheres and posterior fossa structures.
Axial section of FLAIR sequence with intravenous contrast of magnetic resonance imaging in which leptomeningeal uptake is observed at the level of the brainstem.
• CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: no signs of lymph node recurrence or distant spread of breast cancer are identified.
• Tumor markers: normal.
Diagnosis tuberculous meningitis.
Treatment Initially, in the presence of meningitis with pleocytosis predominantly▁lymphocytic, hypoglycorrhachia and hyperproteinorrhachia of subacute onset, empirical antimicrobial treatment with intravenous ceftria every 8 mg plus dexamethasone (2 g).
After ruling out other infectious (viral and bacterial) etiologies, in addition to tumor (meningeal carcinomatosis) and non-infectious inflammatory etiology, the patient only remained on antiserum treatment E/12h: asymptomatic rifampicin 300 mg/24week.
As a secondary pharmacological effect, the patient presented an asymptomatic progressive liver disease of cytolytic profile, with values of AST and ALT of up to 141 and 208 IU/l, respectively, 15 days after the start of treatment.
Due to the good evolution of the hepatic profile, the pharmacological treatment was progressively changed, so that the patient was discharged with isoniazid, rifampicin and levofloxacin for another 2 months and then isoniazid and rifampicin for another 9 months.
In the subsequent outpatient follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and did not present any other complication.
