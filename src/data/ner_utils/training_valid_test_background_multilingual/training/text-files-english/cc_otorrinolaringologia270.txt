A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of dyspnea and stridor for one hour, without known allergies, fever or aspiration that remained constant at the initial assessment.
The patient reported epiglottic lesion under follow-up in another community.
A nasofibrolaryngoscopy was performed, finding edema that began in the nasopharynx and at the oropharynx level impeded endoscopic progression due to the large obstruction.
No evidence of increased volume, local heat, erythema, swelling or other typical signs of deep cervical infections was observed at the cervical level.
After the same evaluation, intravenous corticoid therapy was prescribed, and due to the imminent state of the disorder and its constant conversion, including a large decrease in saturation, a posterior cricothyrotomy was performed.
After stabilizing the patient, a cervicothoracic CT was requested, showing images compatible with left parapharyngeal abscess, retropharyngeal abscess and precaution within which complex tabications and thick walls were observed.
The mediastinal space is free.
A cervical approach was performed for drainage of the abscess, retropharyngeal and left admixture, in which, in our astonishment, appear without content or signs of active infection, so we proceeded to a retrobiotic laryngoscopic approach.
Antibiotherapy and corticotherapy were prescribed and the evolution was satisfactory, achieving decannulation of the patient after 6 days of follow-up and hospitalization, with a correct healing of the surgical wound, without obstruction at the level of the airway.
The anatomopathological result of the lesion was fibrovascular‚ñÅpolyp and the microbiological study of the content of Veillonella.
