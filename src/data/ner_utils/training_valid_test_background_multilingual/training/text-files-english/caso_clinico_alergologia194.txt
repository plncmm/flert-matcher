A 13-year-old female patient with allergy to rosacea and avellane fruits (LTP) and contact dermatitis due to collophonia urticaria diaphoria, who presented with a 15-20-minute history of cough
Allergological study performed (7 months after the event): Prick test with gadobenate dimego type and with gadodiamide (without diluir): additive.
Negative intradermal reaction with gadodiamide at 1/100 and 1/10.
Dime gadobenate was administered at a rate of 1/100, with an increase of 2 mm in‚ñÅpapule size and erythema; and at 1/10, a positive result was obtained with erythema of 18 mm and an increase of 6 mm.
Accompanying of the study: Skin prick test and negative intradermal reaction to gadoteridol, gadoteric acid, gadoxetate and gadobutrol.
Challenges are made up to recommended doses (0.1 mmol/kilo of weight), to gadodiamide and to gadobutrol, resulting negative.
We report a case of anaphylaxis to dimethyme gadobenate in children documented with a positive skin test.
To our knowledge, there is only one case reported in pediatric age of allergic reaction (without anaphylaxis) to gadolinium-based contrast (gadoteridol).
Tolerance to other MC to rule out cross-reactivity and offer safe alternatives to the patient was verified.
