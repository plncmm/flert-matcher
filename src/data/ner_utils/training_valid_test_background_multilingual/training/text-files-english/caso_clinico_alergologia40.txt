3 years old child mucosa allergy after hospitalization due to a cutaneous eruption initially facial, with centrifugal progression, erythematous plaques, some purpura element and perifluent isolated lesions of the lips on day.
The diagnostic impression was MS after a diagnosis of malignancy was made.
The clinical picture had begun on the seventh day of treatment with amoxicillin, indicated by the acute media.
Antihistamine and corticoid treatment was administered with favorable evolution.
Upon admission, the blood count showed an acute phase reactant (Procalcitonin: 19 ng/ml [> 0.5 ng/ml] and leukocytosis), so the patients were treated with ceftazime elevation.
The serologies (Epstein&#146;s Virus - ViroB], cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma, parvovirus) were positive for Mycoplasma, EBV and parvovirus.
She was discharged with cefuroxime axe.
Specific IgE determinations (cefachlor, amoxicillin, penicillin G) were negative.
The skin tests performed (amoxicillin, ampicillin, bacampicillin, cloxacillin, penicillin V, penicillin G, cefalexin and cefixima) were positive according to the Amoxicillin Group 96.
Parents refused to continue the study (skin prick tests and intradermal reaction with delayed reading).
Results: We report a case of MS with aminopenicillin-positive allergological study and serological confirmation of active infection.
Double etiological confirmation raises the need to evaluate drug involvement in similar cases.
