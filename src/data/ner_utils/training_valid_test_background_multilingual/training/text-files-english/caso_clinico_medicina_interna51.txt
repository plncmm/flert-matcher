Personal history A 29-year-old male patient with no known drug allergies or medical and surgical history of interest.
Epidemiologic agent born in India, lives in Angola for 15 years and has made frequent trips to Hong Kong for work reasons.
Current disease comes to the emergency room of a Spanish hospital because while he was carrying out a cruise with his wife by Greece and Turkey, on the 8th day of travel, he began with fever, illiteracy, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
He came to a medical center in Turkey where he was tested for GOT 132 U/L; GPT 244 U/L; GGT 199 U/L, negative HBV and HCV smear, negative.
3 days later, on the 12th day of cruceration, once it is completed, the patient continues with the same clinical picture.
He had previously been in Hong Kong for 20 days and for the 7 days prior to his trip to Angola.
Physical examination and complementary tests in the emergency department revealed fever(39o), TA 93/54 mmHg, HR 93lpm, and physical examination revealed hepatomegaly of the two layers, with no other significant alterations.
Blood tests were performed, highlighting 18000 platelets, creatinine 1.74 mg/dL, total bilirubin 12.14 mg/dL (direct bilirubin 8.63 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 3.51 mg/dL), GOT 163 U/dL.
ECG and chest X-ray showed no significant changes. Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly.
The rapid malaria diagnosis test was repeated, which was positive, smear and thick drop with parasitemia 17 %.
Ev during admission Severe malaria is diagnosed, as criteria for poor prognosis hyperparathyroidism, manifesting itself/transaminasemia and thrombocytopenia.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and started treatment with iv artesunate.
for 3 days during his stay in the IVU, later with the recovery of renal function, thrombocytopenia, tolerance of the oral route and hemodynamic stability, it was decided to transfer the patient to the conventional hospitalisation unit art.
During the following days, the patient presented hemodynamic stability, progressive fever and transaminase decrease.
On day +7 of admission, he again had a fever (38.7oC), and in the analytical control that was carried out was observed a hemoglobin 10.7 mg/dL (at admission 12.2mg/dL) and LDH 1170 U.
During the following days, the patient continued with fever, decreased hemoglobin and elevated LDH, with a hemoglobin nadir (8.3 mg/dL) and elevated LDH 1582 U on day 14 of admission.
Hemolytic anemia was studied and the following complementary tests were performed: · Hemolysis study of: elevation of erythrocytes, decrease of Hb, elevation of LDH, normal haptoglobin and study of the limits of hemoglobin.
 Autoimmunity: ANAs and▁cryoglobulins within normal limits.
• Coombs negative • There is no deficiency G6PD • Immunophenotype within normal limits.
 Cholangioresonance: without significant changes · With no changes in clinical attitude, 13 days later presented hemoglobin figures 10.2 mg/dL, LDH 647 U/L, normalization of external bilirubin 2.91 mg/dL after discharge.
Clinical judgement Severe malaria.
Hemolytic anemia secondary to artisanal treatment.
Good clinical evolution was achieved until the different analytical parameters were normalized.
