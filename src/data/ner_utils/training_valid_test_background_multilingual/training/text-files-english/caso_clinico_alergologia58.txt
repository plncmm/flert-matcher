We report the case of a 14-year-old adolescent who since 2015 presents RLE episodes after unidentified hymenoptera stings.
On one occasion, the reaction has affected 2 units with similar features.
No associated systemic symptoms.
She required emergency care and was treated with corticosteroids and oral antihistamines, with improvement in 5 days.
Results: PC was performed in prick test with negative result, PC in Intradermal reaction against Polistes dominulus (0.01 μg/ml) 4 mm, against Apulais mellifera and Veg.
In vitro study: basal tryptase 3.7 μg/L.
Total IgE 284.1 KU/L, IgE specific: bee 6.15, Polistes spp 3.16, Vespula spp 3.30 and Polistes dominulus 4.09 KU/L.
sIgE by components: Apim1 0.03, Apim2 0.85, Apim4 0, Vesv1 0.16, Vesv▁cool5 0.02, Pold1 0.48, Pold5 0.14, Peroxidase CCD
After the expansion of the study using the component ADVIA technique, the diagnosis was made, suggesting an allergy to Apis and Polistes.
The double positivity to Apis and Vespula is probably due to hyaluronidase and/or CCD.
CCD assemblage could justify the triple sIgE versus Apis, Vespula and Polistes.
