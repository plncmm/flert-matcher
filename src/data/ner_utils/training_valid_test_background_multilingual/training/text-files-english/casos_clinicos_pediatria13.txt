A seven-year-old male patient, born in Calatayud (Zaragoza, Spain), came to the consultation due to the presence of a foreign body in the scalp.
The family reported having been, the previous week, in a rural house in contact with animals, specifically sheep and horses.
On physical examination, the occipital region was identified as having a tick (arr√©posite) located in the tapered jawbone (marginia), which was extracted without incident.
At 48 hours, a 1 x 1 cm papular lesion appeared, with minimal secretion and meliceric crusts, which was treated, at the beginning, with topical mupirocin. Five days after the extraction, the new occipital lesion was asthenia.
On examination, a 3 x 3 cm deep ulcerated lesion was observed in the occipital scalp, with erythematous borders and necrotic center.
Ulcer on our patient's scalp.
Oral medication was prescribed at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for 5 days. During the evolution weeks, successive moist cures were performed, and after that, the dressings were completely healed with hydrocolloid dressings.
The serologies of cryptococcal origin were negative and both polymerase chain reaction PCR and culture of the lesion confirmed the presence of R. aureus.
Currently, Spain is one of the countries with the highest number of reported cases.
Other species, such as Rickettsia raoultii or Rickettsia rioja, could cause similar clinical manifestations.
