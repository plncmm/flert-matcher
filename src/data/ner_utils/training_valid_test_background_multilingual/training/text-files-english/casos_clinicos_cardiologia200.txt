A 35-year-old woman who had a history of active smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years, herpes zoster in 2009, muguet in 2015 and a diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection in 2006 were highlighted.
Current history We present the case of a 35-year-old patient who, as a history of interest, highlights active smoking more than twenty cigarettes a day for 20 years, herpes zoster in 2009, muguet in 2015 and diagnosis of infection by HIV 2006.
The patient started antiretroviral treatment with zidovudine + lamivudine + saquinavir/ritonavir that same year, although adherence to it was erratic and completely abandoned in 2017.
He now comes with asthenia, loss of eleven kilograms in the last months and oral bleeding.
Physical examination revealed marked thinness, regular general condition, tachycardia and gingivostoma hemorrhagic fever compatible with muguet.
▁Complementary tests An analytical test was performed showing a slight detectable pancyte of HIV, urgent serology was requested, with negative results for hepatotropic virus (A, B and C) and syphilis, and positive for CD4 count (million cells).
In addition, the following electrocardiogram (electrocardiogram 1) is requested.
Elseviation of fungal infections due to fluconazole is initiated. Consequently, the patients main opportunistic infections begin to be studied in a short period of time and gradually worsen, as well as the screening for fungal infections
Infections due to microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, syphilis causes such as HIV Parirovecii, Toxoplasma and Cryptococcus are ruled out, and all causes of the tumor are ruled out.
Taking into account and the progressive worsening of the patient both at the clinical level and (needing even transfusions of units and platelets), it was decided to start antiretroviral treatment with darunavir/hospital referral HIV/10 plus emtricita.
A few days after starting antiretroviral therapy, the patient experienced improvement in asthenia and general▁malaise, as well as recovery of laboratory parameters.
However, with special emphasis on the anamnesis and physical examination, he commented that at the present time he had a predominance of dyspnea (with inability to walk on the floor asymptomatically presented more than 100 meters) on auscultation and asthenia.
A new electrocardiogram (electrocardiogram 2) was repeated and laboratory tests were requested with troponin (normal) and NT-proBNP (2,522 pg/m).
Due to these findings, consultation with specialists of the Cardiology Department is recommended, which recommend the performance of a transthoracic echocardiogram, which reveals a right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophic eccentricity, with moderate septal dysfunction and paradoxical left ventricular enlargement.
Given these results, it was decided to perform a right cardiac catheterization that confirmed the diagnosis of moderate pre-capilary pulmonary hypertension and interconsultation with the Pulmonar Hyperconsultation Unit.
With the presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension secondary to HIV, treatment with tadalafil is initiated at doses of 20 mg/day.
With the initiation of this therapy and antiretroviral treatment, in less than 3 weeks the patient experiences substantial clinical improvement, initially allowing walking and performing daily activities without dyspnea.
There was also an improvement in NT-proBNP levels and in the echocardiographic study, which showed normalization of the right ventricular size, lower paradoxical septal motion, and normalization of the RV/LV eccentricity index.
An electrocardiogram (electrocardiogram 3) is also attached.
After completing the study of pulmonary hypertension, having ruled out other causes such as colza oil poisoning, left heart disease, lung disease or thromboembolic disease, the diagnosis of HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension is confirmed.
Diagnosis Pancit secondary to infection by Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Epstein-Pugh Virus and Parvovirus B19.
Hypertuberculosis associated with HIV.
QT prolongation in the context of HIV infection, pulmonary hypertension and drug toxicity.
