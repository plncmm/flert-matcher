A 13-year-old patient with a personal history of polypharmacy.
Located after ingestion of two episodes of bedding and chest oppression which resolved after vomiting.
Subsequently, lip swelling after ingestion of trout,‚ñÅtolerating the rest of fish.
Allergological study: prick with aeroallergens batteries and trophoals positive for grasses, olives, cupressus and phylline.
Prick with commercial extract and prick-prick with fish: positive for trout and salmon.
Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) 281 U/ml, specific IgE hake, tuna and gamba <0.35 kU/l.
In vitro study: production of complete extracts by lyophilization of fresh products of cooked/humed salmon, asalmonated trout, cooked/crubulated emperor, bread and mulch.
Protein quantification by Bradford method, acrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE, Wester Blot, Immunoblotting and Unmunoblotting.
Results: After the in vitro study, it was found that the patient had specific IgE that recognized bands with apparent molecular weight between 35 and 40 kDa of molecular weight in salmonid extracts.
Parvalbumin salmonids are found in a region around 10-12 kDa.
After reviewing the literature, this region could correspond to a region of severe nausea and aldolases of aldolases (40-50 kDa) responsible for moderate monoinfections of these fish species recently described and associated with clinic.
