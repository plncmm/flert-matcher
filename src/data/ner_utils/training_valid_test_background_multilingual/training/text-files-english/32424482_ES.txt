A 56-year-old patient was admitted to our institution due to an ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery.
An angiotomography performed on admission showed lesions indicative of COVID-19, which was confirmed by specific PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
The next day the patient developed abdominal pain and vomiting.
A CT scan showed a free thrombus in the aortic arch associated with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery.
There were no signs of aortic atheroma.
Lack of enhancement of part of the small intestine was also observed.
The patient underwent endovascular thrombectomy and laparotomy with two-meter resection of the small intestine.
