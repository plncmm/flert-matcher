Anamnesis A 53-year-old woman, born in Peru, with hypertension and diabetes.Diagnosticated in April 2010 of chronic renal failure grade V secondary to interstitial nephritis.
He required renal transplantation in May 2012, presenting as immediate complication acute rejection mediated by T cells. Since December 2013 he has presented a deterioration of graft function with proteinuria in nephrotic range.
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 35.
She received tacrolimus and prednisone at low doses.
She was admitted to the nephrology ward in March 2015 for the study of constitutional syndrome consisting of asthenia, anorexia and weight loss of 10 kg of 2 months of evolution, as well as dyspnea on minimal exertion.
Physical examination revealed hypertension 127/67 mmHg, HR 80 bpm.
Saturation 93% (with GN at 1.5 bpm), CS 2.
The patient was conscious and oriented in the three normoperfused.
Eupneic at rest.
▁Right pulmonary vesicular location: absent murmur up to two thirds in the hemithorax, isolated roncus.
Abdomen: blandom and depressible, without masses or enlargement.
Mucocutaneous elimination: anus
▁Complementary tests » Computed tomography (CT) showed massive right pleural effusion, nodular thickening in visceral thickening and bilateral pulmonary nodules with a ground-glass pattern.
Abdominally, a large adenopathic mass is observed around the renal graft extending from the retroperitoneum to the celiac trunk and at the left inguinal level, occupying the iliac chains in the hepatic segment 7 solid lesion is also observed.
Lymphoma is considered the first diagnostic option.
» Percentesis is performed and pleural biopsy is performed, showing pathological anatomy (PA).
» The samples initially sent to PA are negative for malignancy, so ultrasound guided biopsy of an accessible lymphadenopathy is performed, in this case left epigastric. The presence of a▁lymphoproliferative connective tissue shows abundant fascicular proliferation and fusofibrotic fragments carcinoma
Immunohistochemical study is positive for endothelial markers (CD31 and CD34) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), being compatible with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
Diagnosis Visceral Kaposi's sarcoma in a transplanted patient.
Treatment After admission, evacuation was performed, removing multiple liquids due to the presence of trabeculae space.
Given the early recurrence of pleural effusion, the placement of pulmonary pigtail and bleomycin pleurodesis is performed.
On the other hand, once the diagnosis of advanced visceral KS is made, it is initiallyproduced to progressively decrease corticoid treatment and to change the tacrolimus to the evermus immunosuppression therapy.
The patients evolution was favorable, with improvement in the general state (EC) and dyspnea reduction, which is the most disabling symptom.
Semisolid brownish expectoration persists, which is remitted to PA and is also compatible with KS.
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was requested outside the indication, after performing a normal echocardiogram (LVEF 65%).
This treatment began at a dose of 20 mg/m2 in April 2015 and was well tolerated.
