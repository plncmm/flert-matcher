A 71-year-old patient with a history of mycosis fungoides under treatment presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea lasting one week and loss of consciousness of 10kg.
The examination revealed a distended abdomen, painful to palpation generalized, predominantly in the right iliac fossa, with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Because of the patient's poor clinical condition, an abdominal CT study was performed.
In this case, it identifies a circumferential thickening of a long segment of the distal ileum, with dilation of its lumen, associating extension to the adjacent mesenteric fat tissue.
Sigma, terminal ileum and descending colon collapsed with proximal small intestine loops appear.
In addition, in the right iliac fossa, a 6 cm lymph node▁conglomerate is identified in continuity with the described mass.
These findings are indicative of obstruction of the small intestine at the level of the ileum secondary to mass growth, of pelvic location.
The finding of an intestinal mass, by epidemiology, should consider adenocarcinoma as the first possibility.
However, the presentation as a circumferential thickening, with homogeneous density and producing dilation of the intestinal wall, are typical radiological features of intestinal lymphoma.
Likewise, unlike adenocarcinoma, it is common for these▁neoplasms to evolve with involvement of regional lymph nodes.
Although it is true that lymphomas do not usually produce obstruction to advanced stages, the semiological characteristics described, along with the patient's history of mycosis fungoides, supported the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma as the first possibility.
The pathological anatomy study confirmed our suspicion.
