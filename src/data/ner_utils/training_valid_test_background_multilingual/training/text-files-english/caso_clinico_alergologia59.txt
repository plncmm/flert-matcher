A 12-year-old boy who received a hymenoptera sting immediately developed generalized urticaria, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest tightness and dyspnea.
In the emergency room, intramuscular administration of dexchlorpheniramine, intravenous urbason and nebulized salbutamol was given, with good response.
Results: In pediatric immunoallergology consultation was performed study of Apis venom, Vespula and Polistes highlighting prick test positive to vespula determination; IgE positive to IgE antibody to IgE rIgE 1/1000; positive to IgE v
A grade III (severe) systemic reaction to common avispa venom was diagnosed and specific immunotherapy was prescribed for 5 years, clustering regimen, reaching 100 mcg in 6 weeks.
At 2 years, IgG4 levels to Ves v1 and Ves v5 are undetectable.
Immunoblooting was performed confirming the patient with Vespula venom both at Ves v5 and Ves v1.
At 3 and a half years, undetectable IgG4 levels persisted at Ves v1 and Ves v5 with a low decrease in specific IgE.
KAP inhibition was requested.
