An 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was referred to the emergency department with mental disorder and left hemiparesis.
The family stated that there was no history of cough or fever, but reported that the patient had suffered frequent falls during the last week.
The patient was asked to protect the airway and the protocol for stroke was activated.
Vital signs in the emergency room were significant in terms of temperature (37.9 °C), pulse (101 l.p.m.)
and blood pressure (130/77 mmHg).
Physical examination showed left hemiplegia and aphasia.
A value of 36 was calculated on the NIHSS scale.
A head CT scan revealed an acute stroke of the right MCA.
A craniomaxillofacial angiotomography showed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at origin and bilateral apical patched pulmonary opacities.
An perfusion scintigraphy revealed an infarction nucleus of 305 cc in the right MCA and a surrounding ischemic penis of 109 cc.
The patient was considered not to have received neurosurgical intervention due to the large dimensions of the infarction nucleus.
Taking into account the outcomes, a positive test for infection was performed for COVID-19 by PCR.
On admission, laboratory tests showed elevated leukocyte count with▁lymphocytic colitis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (13966 ng/ml SDD), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (162 mg/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (169).
The clinical picture of the patient was complicated by acute kidney injury and increasingly higher oxygen requirements.
On the third day of admission, her family decided to extubate with control measures.
