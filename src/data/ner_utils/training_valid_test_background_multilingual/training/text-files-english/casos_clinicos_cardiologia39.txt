69 year old man.
Claim of biological AVR 9 months earlier.
The patient came from BAC with no relevant epidemiological history.
The patient was evaluated for fever and intermittent chills of 2 months duration.
Samples for CH were repeatedly negative; TEE: an anechoic image compatible with abscess drained in the territory of mytroaortic fibrous tissue; PET-CT: hypercaptation at perivalvular level.
Empirical antibiotic treatment with Daptomycin 10 mg/kg/day + Ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 6 weeks with probable early Aouda diagnosis with negative HC was performed.
Due to the favorable evolution, it was decided not to perform surgical treatment during this hospitalization.
Two months after ATB treatment is completed, the patient recurs with fever and chills.
Newly negative BC and TEE with progression of the perivalvular lesion Surgery was decided.
A perivalvular sample was sent for culture, AP and PCR in which C. burnetti was detected by 16S DNA sequencing.
Serology for IFI for Coxiella IgG 1/256.
Treatment was initiated with Doxy dye 200 mg/day + Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day.
During its evolution and without ever being able to be externalized, it suffers multiple complications associated with health care, which lead to death 5 months after surgery.
Coxiella burnetti is a rare cause of burn.
It should be suspected especially in HC-negative patients and specific epidemiological factors such as contact with cattle, sheep and goats.
