We report the case of a 23-year-old patient, born in▁Leon, Guanajuato; who one month before moved to Mexico City; after the transport in bus, an erythematous▁papybara neck lost its residence.
One week later, the patient presented multiple pruritic lesions in the upper and lower limbs, as well as difficulty sleeping due to "severe itching"; in addition to finding new lesions every morning upon▁awakening.
During the interview, the patient said that he rent a room with poor hygiene conditions, without overcrowding or promiscuity.
Physical examination revealed a disseminated dermatosis in the trunk and upper and lower limbs, characterized by numerous erythematous and pruritic▁papules, some with linear configuration and scratch marks.
▁Right male with linear erythematous▁papules.
Cutaneous eruption of the right eye, posterior face, with▁papules. In the dermatization, secondary blood crusts are seen by scratch marks and hyperpigmented macules.
Post-treatment hyperpigmented macules.
Based on the data collected, the diagnosis of insect pruritus secondary to oral candidiasis was suspected and after the onset of hypnotic pruritus was satisfactory. The patient was treated with antihistamines based on residual pruritus hyperpigmentation.
The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the insect brought by the patient (Cimex ularius).
