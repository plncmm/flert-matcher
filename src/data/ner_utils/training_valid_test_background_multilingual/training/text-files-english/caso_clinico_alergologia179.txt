A 4-year-old girl diagnosed with cow's milk protein allergy, egg allergy, frequent episodic asthma due to dust mites and mild atopic dermatitis.
In the neonatal period he took a bottle with a formula adapted with good tolerance, after which he continued breastfeeding.
Five months later, after reintroducing an adaptation formula, the patient developed urticaria and laryngeal stridor, which was then withdrawn and continued with soy formula.
In 2011 he came to our clinic, a prick test was performed with cow's milk protein and cow's milk protein specific ALA, with positive result in all cases (total IgA: 129 case40, LV: 22,80).
In 2013, she presented anaphylactic shock after accidental ingestion of dessert with traces of milk, and in 2014, she decided to include in a procedure of «sickness» above the previous study with skin tests in Prick positive and CAP.
Despite premedication, she presented frequent adverse reactions, several times severe, unsuccessful treatment.
The use of compassionate use of Omalizumab was requested, and after its beginning, the procedure was restarted, with good tolerance, and it was completed without incidents.
She is currently on omalizumab treatment and is on a free diet for VFP.
Omalizumab has been useful in food allergy as an adjuvant in tolerance induction procedures.
In our case, tolerance was achieved after failure of previous procedure.
