A 23-year-old male who was initially diagnosed by Urology for finding very low testosterone levels with low gonadoin derivatives. He had consulted for a year because of difficulties in maintaining erection.
Ejaculation with low volume and liquid.
He maintains and recovers mental illness.
No anosmia.
Normal weight and cognitive development.
Start of pubarche at age 12.
No eunucoid habit, 12 mL tests bilateral.

She wished her mother to think she was a third-degree cleft lip and palate newborn.
She did not report drug or anabolic use.
No palatal cleft malformations.
No syndromic appearance or clinical impression of systemic inflammatory disease or chronic disease.
As relevant family history, her mother suffers from primary hypothyroidism, monorene sister, a cousin with celiac disease and another cousin by the mother with neonatal hyperammonemia diagnosed in neonatal screening (usually healthy 13 years).
A complete hormonal study was requested, where the analytical result of secondary hypogonadism was again objectified, but no other hormonal alterations were observed; hemochromatosis was ruled out in an analytical study.
Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging was requested, in which no alteration was observed.
Since the complete study had been conducted, the diagnosis of Kallman syndrome normic course was proposed, so genetic study of genes GNRHR, KISS1R or KISS1 is requested, currently under development.
Initially, intramuscular Testosterone Cypionate was prescribed every 21 days and the patient reported significant improvement in vitality, libido and volume of ejaculations.
The use of gonadoin analogs should be considered in case the patient has gestational desire.
Although the case could initially appear as acquired secondary hypogonadism due to the late age of onset, there is no apparent etiologic trigger for this.
Reviewing the literature, it is said that Kallman syndrome may manifest late, although it is not frequent.
