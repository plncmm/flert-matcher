Personal history DMNIR, treated with▁steroids and methotrexate, episode of right lithiasis-related uropathy treated with Cfunduscopy complicated and Pseudomona MR with renal abscess (transthoracic echocardiography) after kidney transplant complicated colitis and pseudomona
A 71-year-old man was admitted with a 4-day history of fever, cough and severe back pain.
After 48 hours she presented pain and coldness in the RLL.
Febril, regular general condition.
TA:90/60mmHg.
Cardiopulmonary arrest was established, with no murmurs.
Pain on top of the backbone
RLS: distal coldness, fixed tapes in lateral compartments, stiffness and tibio-peroneastragalin.
Located MMII only palpable femoral der and pedioizq.
▁Complementary tests were: high acute phase reactants and prerenal renal failure (Thorax Rx and normal ECG).
- 1: What did it exist after that acute ischemia?
Etiologically, it could be due to: arterial embolism (AF, myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction, endocarditis, valve disease or prosthesis, myxoma, aneurysm, atherosclerotic plaque or paradoxical embolism atriotic dissection or atherosclerosis (arterial thrombosis).
Transthoracic ultrasound showed an image compatible with aortic endocarditis.
Parallel to this, isolated microbiology in hemocultives C. albicans, fluconazole-resistant.
Non-embolization therapy.
TAC-abdominal: spondylodiscitis D7-D8.
- 2nd: Endoscopitis on native aortic valve due to cation albicans resistant to azoles, criteria?
treatment?
According to the modified Duke criteria, it was a definitive infectious endocarditis (1 major and 4 minor).
Echinocandin B +/- Flucytosine is recommended at high doses.
After initial iv treatment, reduce to an oral azole at least 6 weeks after surgery, except for fluconazole resistance, which recommend voriconazole or posaconazole if sensitive.
And if resection is not possible, prolong treatment.
Our case was treated with caspoline, valve resection and supracondylar amputation.
3rd.▁~~~ Presence of endocarditis in the first admission?
Certainly it did not meet criteria and was reasonably discarded.
However, recurrence of bacteraemia without new urological complications raises suspicion that some focus persisted over time and endocarditis would be the first candidate.
Final diagnosis· Endoscopy on native aortic valve due to▁cyanosis resistant to azoles.
 Acute ischemia grade iii in mid and spondylodylodyscitis d7-d8, probably secondary to septic emboli.
