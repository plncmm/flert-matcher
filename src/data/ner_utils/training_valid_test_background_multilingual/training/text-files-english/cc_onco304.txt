Anamnesis A 47-year-old patient with no relevant past medical history was taken to the emergency department for blunt abdominal trauma after a traffic accident.
Upon arrival, acute abdomen was evident and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy which showed a large amount of free blood in the peritoneal cavity secondary to rupture of the splenic inferior polar artery.
During surgery, a retroperitoneal adenopatic▁conglomerate is observed, from which biopsies are taken.
Pathological examination revealed grade 1 follicular lymphoma.
PET-CT was performed to visualize hypermetabolic foci in bilateral axillary, mediastinal, iliac lymph nodes and a large retroperitoneal cluster compatible with lymphoma involvement.
A bone marrow biopsy showed follicular lymphoma.
Rehistorying the patient, there were no symptoms B or constitutional syndrome, referring only low back pain of little entity that considered it normal in his work as a trucker.
She started chemotherapy with CHOP-Rituximab, which received 6 cycles with good tolerance.
On reassessment PET, partial response with persistent retroperitoneal disease.
Second line treatment with MDF-R (Fludarabine - Mitoxantrone - Dexamethasone - Rituximab) with complete response by PET-CT at 4 cycles but with severe toxicity was initiated.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed, which did not show lymphoma, so a maintenance Rituximab was started.
Clinical improvement since the end of chemotherapy, although persistent neutropenia and platelet count grade 1.
After 19 months of treatment, the patient complained of painless hematuria.
Physical condition Patient with good general condition although pale.
No symptoms B.
Peripheral adenopathy - Cardiorespiratory failure: normal abdominal consolidation
Low back pain Non-malignant oedema complementary tests Analytical: Normal liver and kidney profile.
No electrolyte disturbances.
Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, Leukocytes 2650/μL (Neutrophils 1410/μL), Platelets 123000 TAC Thorax: Coronary artery calcifications.
▁Right paratracheal and left paraaortic▁ganglia, of non-significant size.
No significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy was observed.
No pleuropulmonary alterations of interest were observed.
TAC Abdomen and pelvis: Hepatomegaly with moderate steatosis, with no evidence of focal lesions.
Homogeneous stricture.
No free fluid or significant intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy were observed.
Pancreas and right kidney with no changes of interest.
Left renal pelvis fracture due to a soft tissue density mass, ̄ 40x44x51 mm (apxtxl) with contrast uptake, not present in previous CT scans.
It causes dilation of cavities, especially in the upper group, without ureteral dilation compatible with urothelial tumor.
With the findings presented in the Urology Committee and nephrectomy was performed showing renal pelvis in small cell neoplasia and regular morphology.
Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for CD 45, CD 20, CD 10, Bcl 2, Bcl 6 and negativity for CD 138, CD5 and▁Cyclin D1.
The proliferative index by Ki 67 is approximately 10%.
malignant transformation of the renal medulla with follicular lymphoma as the only relapse focus is called non- blastic cluster, repeats PET-CT scans that confirm the absence of other foci and performs a new bone marrow biopsy that does not show a
The findings are presented in the Hematology Committee, minialotransplantation case of unrelated donor due to the absence of compatible siblings.
The patient suffered a diabetic debt with blood glucose in more than 1000 mg/dL during conditioning.
After the conditioning, she required admission to the ICU due to severe diarrhea with prerenal renal failure and suspected thrombotic microangiopathy probably related to Tacrólimus used as prophylaxis of graft versus host disease.
Poor evolution of the clinical picture with decreased level of consciousness, appearance of de novo atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response to 150 beats per minute and fever with isolation in hemocultive of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli a poor recovery 16
