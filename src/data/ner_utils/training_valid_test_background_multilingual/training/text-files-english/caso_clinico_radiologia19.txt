A 37-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with a fever of 39oC and pain in the right hypochondrium.
The examination revealed significant hepatomegaly.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased acute phase reactants.
Abdominal ultrasound showed three lesions occupying hepatic space, hypoechogenic and with poorly defined contours, displacing the vessels in the vicinity.
These findings were confirmed by CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast agents, and liver lesions were identified as abscesses.
Along with this, dyssyntax of the endometrial cavity is identified by liquid content with endometrial enhancement and a hypodense tubular structure in the right adnexa region with enhancement of its wall.
Transvaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of right pyosalpinx.
The patient was diagnosed with liver abscesses secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease. Ultrasound-guided drainage of the most peripheral liver abscesses was performed and culture of the material obtained was positive for Actinomyces israelii.
