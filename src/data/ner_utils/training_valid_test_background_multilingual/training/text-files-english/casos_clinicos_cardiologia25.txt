An 89-year-old woman, with no known history, presented with a 15-day history of fever of 39 degrees, asthenia, adynamia, urinary symptoms in the previous week, who had been hospitalized with ciprofloxacin for up to 500mg.
Findings highlighted in the physical examination: pale conjunctiva, tachycardic cardiac noises, rhythmic, normospicuous, murmur with a four-digital dysphonia in the left iliac mass, palpable centimeter.
On admission laboratory: leukocytes: 13,300mm3, neutrophils 77%, hemoglobin: 6.8mg/dl, hematocrit: 21.6mg/dl, ESR: 109MM, CRP: (++).
Urocultive and hemocultive examinations were performed, and an abdominal CT was requested, which showed the presence of bilobulated formation of apparent gynecological origin. On the left side, the image suggested a fistula with a small bowel lesion.
With presumptive diagnosis of perforated tumor with intestinal fistula, the patient was taken to the operating room and antibiotic treatment was started covering abdominal focus.
Since the patient remained febrile, in addition to positive hemocultive results for Escherichia Coli, an echocardiogram was requested, which reported rounded image of 1.5x0.8 millimeters, which could correspond to a good clinical evolution with cefstax gentamicin.
