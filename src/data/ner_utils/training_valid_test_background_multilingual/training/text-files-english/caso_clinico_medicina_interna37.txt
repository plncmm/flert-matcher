A 42-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department for the third time with fever of up to 38-5oC fluctuating, with no clear predominance of morning or evening, and for 17 days with epigastric pain in one month.
10 days before she had started treatment with ciprofloxacin without improvement.
His antecedents included a 19-year-old ex-smoker for 8 years, history of sinusitis-as a package of congenital syphilis, congenital syphilis, pollen episodes.
In January 2013, the patient required admission to Internal Medicine for community-acquired pneumonia of the lower left lobe with minimal associated pleural effusion, with peripheral urticaria, which remains until the time of this consultation.
Physical examination revealed pain upon palpation of the deep mesogastrium with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
During her stay in the emergency room, laboratory tests were requested, highlighting CRP 111.2 mg/l; 1.200 (18.5%) , admitted to Internal Medicine wards as fever for study and psychiatric outpatient treatment.
Upon arrival to the plant, the patient continues with feverish peaks, abdominal pain and diarrhea beginning with constipation.
Complete laboratory analysis was requested, showing an elevated Ac3.79; 6200 (50.4%), elevated CRP of 108.7 mg/l, rheumatoid factor of 591.8 IU/mL, tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, CA19 1253; CA19
Antiphospholipids that were normal, as well as serology of Salmonella, Brucella, Coxiella burni; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Ritessia conorii all negative.
Personal history of the patient, clinical findings and laboratory findings included the following diagnoses: differential infection by gastroenteritis; eosinophilic disease as eosinophilic syndrome, gastrointestinal lymphoma (tra gastrointestinal leukemia), non-ophiphilic leukemia
To continue the study, IgE was requested, which was 325, Frotis peripheral blood smears showing absolute positivity, without observing atypical cells; Feces study ruled out the presence of▁parasites
A CT scan of the chest-thorax-abdomen was simultaneously ordered and found synuopathy, small pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion with atelectasis of the lower lobe and colitis with moderate amounts of free abdominal fluid.
Invasive tests such as Paracentesis, Gastro-colonsoc and nasofibroscopy were performed to complete the study, and samples were obtained for both microbiology and Pathological Anatomy.
While the study was conducted, the patient began treatment with Corticotherapy and antibiotic coverage with Ceftriaxone, with improvement of digestive symptoms and pleural effusion.
Microbiology results were obtained, which ruled out the presence of the pathogen in the samples received; however, Pathological Anatomy confirms the presence of▁eosinophils in all the samples received.
With the results of the differential diagnoses that were raised discard the presence of parasitosis, illness.
The presence of an eosinophylic gastroenteritis that added to the patient's personal history made the diagnosis of Churg Strauss Disease stronger, than according to the ACR criteria: ·
· Eosinophilia greater than 10% in the differential count of white blood cells.
• Development of mono-polyneuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy (guante/calcetin distribution) attributable to systemic vasculitis
· Transient or migratory pulmonary infiltrates on X-ray (not including fixed infiltrates) attributable to systemic vasculitis
 Paranasal sinus abnormality: History of acute or chronic paranasal pain or hypersensitivity to the touch or radiological opacification of the paranasal sinuses.
• Extravascular eosinophilia
Biopsy including arteries, arterioles or venules that show accumulation of▁eosinophils in extravascular areas.
· Of those who met 5 of the 6 criteria, so after clinical improvement the patient is discharged with the following diagnosis: · Churg-Strauss disease in eosinophilic phase.
• Continuing with treatment with Dacortín 30mg daily with a decrease in paulatin to 20 mg with which it would be maintained.
· The patient continues with revisions starting treatment recently with immurel for exacerbations of abdominal pain.
