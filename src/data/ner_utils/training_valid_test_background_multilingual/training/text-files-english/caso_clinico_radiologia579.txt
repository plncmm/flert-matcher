A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with asthenia, headache and altered level of consciousness in recent days.
Blood count revealed 1240 leukocytes (N 0% and L 39.4%), Hb: 5.6, hematocrit: 15.5, and platelets: 23000.
With these data and blood smear, she was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (LAM3).
Physical examination revealed disorientation and drowsiness, so a simple CT scan of the skull was performed.
Cranial CT scan showed: - multiple lesions hyperdensity cortical and subcortical lesions, the largest cerebellar lesions, left temporal lobe, compatible with parenchymal hemorrhages and sulphide-cortical lesions suggestive of sulfonyloid lesions.
These findings may be due to brain involvement by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Another possibility would be angioinvasive aspergillosis.
