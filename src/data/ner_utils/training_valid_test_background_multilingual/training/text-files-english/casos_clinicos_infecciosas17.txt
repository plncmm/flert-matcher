A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 6-day history of high fever of up to 40oC, accompanied by intense dysuria and pollakiuria, ciprofloxacin 500 mg once daily improved in Primary Care.
Among its antecedents, the following stand out: doubtful Propifena, non-insulin dependent type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hyperlipemia due to laparoscopic access in childhood allergy and mixed mestectomized patients had been admitted to hospital.
The examination revealed fever (39oC), conscious and oriented, eupneic at rest, well nourished, hydrated, perfused and hemodynamically stable.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed normal sounds without murmurs, with vesicular murmur preserved, with no sounds overwhelmed.
The abdomen was blade, depressible, and there were no masses or enlargements.
She had complaints of epigastric discomfort without defense or peritonitis.
Conserved air-fluids and bilateral non-painful renal percussion.
Neurological examination did not reveal any relevant findings.
No skin lesions or other remarkable data were found.
▁Complementary findings: in the hemogram there was leukocytosis 18,600 /mm3, with 15,070 granulocytes and 6% of falls, lymphocytes: 1,300/mm3, platelets: 70,000 /mm3, normal with the rest of parameters in
In coagulation: PT 13.3 sec, normal ATTP, fibrinogen 1.161 mg/dL and in biochemistry: glycemia 223 mg/dl, creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, Na 130 mEq/L, BD 0.160 mg/GT A
PCR 17.9 mg/L.
Positive nitrites were detected in urine analysis and sediment showed pyuria and intense bacteriuria.
The chest and abdominal X-ray, as well as the electrocardiogram, did not show any findings of interest.
Although the presumptive diagnosis in the emergency room according to the previously described data was "sepsis of probable urinary origin", given the laboratory findings of elevated bilirubin with discrete cytolysis and abdominal ultrasound left lobe with large volume left lobe involvement (with large lobe involvement in left lobe, CT scan) left lobe with a previous large volume of left lobe and left lobe with left lobe with left lobe and left lobe with left lobe with large volume of 8
Likewise, millimetric lithiasis in the distal common bile duct with a normal caliber bile duct were very likely.
The radiological conclusion was that in the clinical context of the patient, the best diagnostic possibility was acute pyogenic cholangitis that was starting a liver abscess (not yet organized) in LHI.
The patient was admitted to the hospital with hemocultives. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated with Piperacillin/ tazoRM with 4/0.5 contrast every 6h. Ultrasound was performed to complete the diagnosis.
Twenty-four hours after admission, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous area of about 90x80 mm in diameter in LHI, very suggestive of multiple liver abscesses, as well as cysts septate in LHD.
Cholangio-MRI was performed 48 hours after admission and was reported as probable biliary sludge in common liver, and probable intrahepatic abscess in LHI, without ruling out cholangiocarcinoma.
Due to the discrepancies between the different imaging techniques, we opted for an endoscopic▁retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
On the 4th day of admission, antibiotic therapy was switched to Imipenem/ cilastacin 500mg/6h IV, still growing empirically, in order to achieve a peak in non febrile episodes.
▁ERCP ruled out bile duct obstruction (sphincterotomy and cleaning of the duct without removing material) allowing the diagnosis of "multiple pyogenic liver abscesses".
Differential diagnosis On the pathogenesis of abscesses is to say that they usually develop after peritonitis (through portal circulation), after direct infection), by biliary dissemination via a penetrating wound or through a surgical wound, or
Knowing the pathogenesis is essential and guides to the responsible pathogen in most cases.
Regarding microbiology, most of them are polymicroorganism searches (anaerobic and facultative cases), although a high variability of pathogens has been described as responsible for this pathology, which justifies the microbiological diagnosis of this disease.
The potential pathogens included in the differential diagnosis of liver abscesses in our case were: 1.
Streptococcus milleri or S. anginosus group (including S. constellatus and S. intermedius) is an important cause of liver abscess.
When they are involved, the search for simultaneous metastatic infections in other places is mandatory.
2.
S. aureus, S. pyogenes and other Gram-positive▁cocci are pathogens to be considered under specific circumstances, such as in patients who underwent transarterial embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.
3.
Candida spp have also been implicated in pyogenic liver abscess and represent up to 22 percent of liver abscesses in published series.
Hepatosplenic candidiasis may occur in patients who have received chemotherapy and have recovery of neutrophil counts after an episode of neutropenia.
4.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important emerging pathogen.
Especially involved in Asia and South Africa.
5.
Tuberculous liver abscesses are uncommon, but should be considered when the hemocultives are negative.
6.
Lipid disorders are rare.
Patients affected by this condition are usually immunosuppressed and most cases present as meningitis or primary bacteremia.
7.
Burkholderia pseudomallei (the agent of Melioidosis) should be considered in patients from endemic areas (Southeast Asia and North Australia).
8.
And amebiasis should be considered as a cause of primary liver abscess, especially in patients from endemic areas or who have traveled to an endemic area in the last six months.
lobe abscess, persisting on day 7 of admission with fever peaks of multiple episodes, despite the change of empirical antibiotic therapy (negative serial hepatic failure), hepatectomy was performed due to left liver abscess.
Twenty-four hours after surgery, the patient was afflicted for the first time since his arrival at the hospital and acute phase reactants began to decline progressively.
In the intraoperative tissue sample, one Klebsiella pneumoniae hypervirviral serotype K1 (magA+, rmpA+) was isolated, with an antibiogram sensitive to both treatments, while the other remained invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae (both known as non-Pyzopenic isolates).
End-stage diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae hypervirulent K1 magA+, rmpA+ hepatic abscess".
