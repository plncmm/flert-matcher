A 58-year-old man was admitted to Cayetano Heredia Hospital with a 2-month history of vomiting, fever of 38°C, and severe disabling low back pain.
Clinical examination revealed a multifocal holosystolic murmur with predominance of mitral focus of intensity III/VI, irradiating to the axilla and neck.
Positive sign of Lasegue and Psoas, as well as positive Dandy sign in L3, L4 and L5.
Laboratory data obtained at admission were: hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dl, hematocrit: 38%, leukocyte count: 14.01/μl (Neutrophils: 116/16 mm), erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 14.01/μl.
The chest X-ray showed no signs of condensation.
Similarly, the electrode position at rest showed no relevant changes.
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral and aortic valve involvement characterized by vegetations in the anterior valve of the mitral valve (atrial and ventricular surface of segment A2) and severe aneurysm of 1.6 x 1.3 cm that conditioned failure (0.7 cm.
Also, in the aortic valve multiple vegetations were found in the three valves; the largest was 0.9 cm, severe regurgitation and flow compatible with posterior semilunar valve perforation reg.
Streptococcus gordonnii was isolated from the blood cultures.
Additionally, the lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging showed vertebral osteomyelitis of L4-L5 .
During the surgical procedure, the above findings were confirmed and the aortic and mitral bivalvular replacement was performed with the implantation of mechanical prostheses.
