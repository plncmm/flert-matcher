A 90-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with dysphagia but complained of abdominal pain of several days duration, with deterioration of renal function in the laboratory.
A simple abdominal x-ray was performed, revealing gas surrounding the bladder suggestive of emphysematous cyst.
It was decided to perform a CT scan of the pelvic non-invasive bladder, which confirmed the intramural bladder gas in the perivesical space and extending cranially dissecting the anterior abdominal wall.
Emphysematous cyst with extraperitoneal bladder perforation versus associated necrotizing fasciitis is suggested.
E. coli was found in urine culture.
One month later, after intravenous antibiotic and oral treatment, the patient was monitored, with resolution of emphysema.
