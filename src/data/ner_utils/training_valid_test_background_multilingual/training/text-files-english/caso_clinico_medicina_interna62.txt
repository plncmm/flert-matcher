Start several cycles of antibiotics on an outpatient basis after collecting▁exudate culture with negative growth of S. coagulasa (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin) and ointment without improvement
After growth and poor evolution is assessed by surgery increasing the duration of antibiotic treatment and debridement.
After passing this time and in the presence of the persistence of the lesion, increase in size and signs of infection and secondary inflammation are derived to the Hospital for evaluation.
