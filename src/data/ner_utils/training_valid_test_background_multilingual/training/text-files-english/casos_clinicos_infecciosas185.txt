A 17-year-old native male from Romania with no history or habitual treatment who had experienced recurrence in Spain for 1 year with his family, who was healthy.
He did not report any toxic habits.
The patient was seen in the emergency room after a 7-day history of continuous frontal headache radiating to the occipital region. During the last 48 hours, fever of up to 39° and several episodes of vomiting in gunshot were observed.
She did not present any other symptoms in the rest of the anamnesis by organs and devices.
He was taking amoxicillin and ibuprofen prescribed by his primary care physician with little response to it.
The physical examination showed good general condition, although fever was 38.8°, hemodynamically stable and from the ventilatory point of view, with a Glasgow coma scale score of 15 and no neurological focality.
Blood count showed leukocytosis of 15,600 per mm3 with 86% neutrophils and a C-reactive protein of 26.5 mg/dl; the rest of blood count, biochemistry and coagulation were within normal range.
The chest X-ray did not show any condensation, hiliar lymph nodes or signs of pleural effusion.
A lumbar puncture was performed, previous eye fundus ruled out the presence of papillitis, obtaining a clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with slight increase in outflow pressure.
Gram stain of CSF was negative with a biochemistry that showed 21 leukocytes (83% lymphocytes), glycorrachy 54 mg/dl, 90 mg/dl protein and 15 U▁adenosine deaminase.
The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit with a syndromic diagnosis of▁lymphocytic meningitis of possible tuberculous etiology antibiotic (cephtria and vancomycin) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR and PCR), with antibiotic coverage (ceftriabridxone and vancomycin).
Differential diagnosis With the syndromic diagnosis of▁lymphocytic meningitis, the differential diagnosis was proposed between: Bacterial meningitis: • Partially treated meningitis.
• Lipid hypersensitivity
• Meningitis due to spirochetes (Treponema spp.
Borrelia spp.).
• Infectious bacterial endocarditis.
• Suppurative pictures by parameningeal foci.
• Intracellular meningitis (Riotsias spp., Coxiella burnetti).
Viral meningitis: • Meningitis due to enterovirus.
• Herpesvirus meningitis.
• Meningitis due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
• Meningitis due to adenovirus.
• Meningitis due to▁lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
• Meningitis due to influenzavirus.
• Meningitis due to▁parotiditis.
• Arbovirus meningitis
Tuberculous meningitis.
Fungal meningitis.
Non-infectious meningitis: • Meningitis.
• Neurosarcoidosis.
• Chemical meningitis (non-steroidal, co-trimoxazole).
E. Borpon burnella in CSF for enterovirus, herpesvirus, parotiditis, Toscana virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as well as the regina in CSF, serologies of HIV
Clinically the patient remained febrile at 72 hours, and headache and vomiting had worsened, so an urgent cranial computed tomography (CT) was requested.
CT showed a fluid collection at the bifrontal level extending almost all the surface of both lobes with moderate mass effect and signs of dura mater with pathological uptake of the duramater.
CT of the skull (axial cut and sagittal reconstruction): a hypodense collection corresponding to the epidural empyema with contrast uptake of the dura mater is observed.
In addition, a lysis of the posterior wall of the left frontal sinus was observed, which was confirmed by three-dimensional bone reconstruction as a probable parameningeal origin of the collection.
Cranial CT (axial cut in bone window and three-dimensional bone reconstruction): a solution of continuity of the posterior wall of the left frontal sinus is observed.
With the radiological diagnosis of epidural empyema, the Neurosurgery Department was contacted and decided to urgently intervene the patient after a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to complete the study.
This confirmed the epidural involvement in addition to a subdural and parietal component of the empyema of up to 16 mm.
Together with pansinusitis of both sinuses, frontal and ethincter left.
Cranial MRI (sagittal cut in T1 and axial in T2 before craniotomy): subdural component of the empyema and parietal involvement of the empyema are observed.
In the water diffusion sequence there was restriction of this, which strongly supported the purulent origin of the collection.
A bifrontal craniotomy and a right parietal traction were performed with evacuation of the purulent content and frontal sinus cranialization together with a▁grey flap to seal the fistula.
Intraoperative findings were an epidural plastron with thickened dura mater and bleaching.
Blood cultures and CSF cultures, including long-term antibiotic prophylaxis were negative for mycobacteria one and Precurrent was negative. In contrast, intra-operative samples grew Streptococcus constella penicillin 500 mg each.
The patients evolution was not very favorable either, nor did he attend the evacuation stage. None of the patients presented neurological symptoms, although a 5 mm empyema component persisted in the control MRI, so it was decided to use nasal
Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull (sagittal cut in T1 and axial in T2 of MR after craniotomy): virtually complete evacuation of the empyema with a small residual component of about 5 mm was observed.
In subsequent revisions the complete resolution of empyema and pansinusitis was confirmed, being asymptomatic and without recurrences of the process at present.
Final diagnosis The final diagnosis was polymicrobial epidural and subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis with posterior wall fistula of the left frontal sinus.
