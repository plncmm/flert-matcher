A 45-year-old patient, born in Mauritania, resident in Spain since 2002, came to infectious consultation due to the appearance of "bultoma" in the left foot sole with progressive growth of one year of evolution.
As epidemiological background of interest, the previous year had returned to its country of origin for a month where he was performing works at home, being▁barefoot, beginning the symptoms later.
It does not remember trauma, bites, or bites of animals in the area.
No fever or other systemic symptoms.
The examination revealed a rounded "bultoma" with a diameter of 2 cm, of fatty consistency, not adhered to deep planes, without ulceration or signs of associated inflammation.
Microorganism entrance doors and arthritis data were not observed.
No other similar skin "bultomas" or presence of normal joint sounds, dL.▁Complementary tests were performed: analytical: glucose 90 mg/dl, creatinine 0.83 mg/dL, biochemistry with cholesterol > 150 mg/dl.
Serology HIV, syphilis, syphilis, HCV negative, HBV serology compatible with past infection.
X-ray of the affected foot: hallux valgus without evidence of osteomyelitis.
Finally,▁dermatology was contacted to perform excision of the lesion without empirical treatment, waiting for results.
Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis established in the case of subcutaneous lesions of patients coming from the tropics includes infectious causes typical of tropical medicine, infectious causes not related to the country of origin, such as syphilis gomas.
Infections: In this group, emphasis should be placed on those caused by asbestos-related diseases that grow in typical humid and alkali environments in the tropics.
Subcutaneous mycoses include sporotrichosis,▁chromoblastomycosis, entomophtoromycosis and mycetoma.
Lobomycosis and rhinosporidiosis are included in this classification; however, the first is located exclusively in the mucosa of the second case, which is not part of the differential diagnosis of our patient and in the first four cases.
These infections have in common that the etiologic agent is usually located on the earth and in fresh or dry plant material, as certain members relate to direct facial expressions, etc... so that the primary infection begins when there is an inoculation of mental
Sporotrichosis is produced by the fungus cresceporothrixkenckii. After inoculation, it produces approximately an indurated lesion known as chancro sporosum and screna after 10 days.
The lesion may remain localized or may spread by lymph dissemination causing satellite lesions in the form of fatty nodules and chronic verrucous plaques1.
Chromoblastosis is caused by hyphomycetes of the Dematiaceae family (Phialophora vercosa, Cladosium carrionii are characterized by the most important colony and serosa.
The lesions that originate can be verrucous or granulomatous nodules, or can be smooth and firm tumors that take between one and two months to appear.
It is characteristic the appearance of black spots hemopurulent on its surface.
Lymphatic dissemination is rare, although other adjacent lesions may appear by autoinoculation.
Entomophtoromycosis includes diseases produced by the genera Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus.
It has a high prevalence in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia.
Both produce an indolent infection with granulomatous changes in the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue without bone or systemic involvement.
Individually, Basidiobolus ranarum disease is known as basidiobolomycosis. It presents as a solitary, hard, circumscribed mass usually located in the extremities.
Clinically, it can be confused with a soft tissue sarcoma.
Mycetoma is produced by different types of true fungal infections (mucosal infections or eumicetomas) and two aerobic actinomicetes (non-tuberculous actinomicetoma) which are also called actinomicetoma.
Apart from this group of bacteria that originate the mycetoma, other bacterial infections that can cause similar lesions such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium leprae should also be considered.
Finally, with respect to protozoa, Leishmania spp would be another entity to consider in our differential diagnosis.
The cutaneous form can present as a localized cutaneous, recurrent, diffuse cutaneous and mucocutaneous form although the latter in Africa is rare.
In Mauritania cutaneous leishmaniasis by Leishmania major is endemic in the south, the region of Aloun-el-Arouss, Nema and in the borders with Mali and Senegal.
Leishmania lesions originate from the inoculation of the protose through the bite of the Phleboto phleboto in Africa, or the America Lutz vector in South America.
They are located in regions such as face and arms and their appearance seems to occur in some areas with the rainy seasons, attending to the vector's life cycle.
Non-infectious lesions (such as soft tissue sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or focal carcinoma) in countries or granulomatous reactions to foreign bodies, a special mention deserves podoconiosis as a cause of lesions.
This occurs as a consequence of an inflammatory reaction to mineral particles of the soil.
They penetrate through the skin and are phagocytized and transported by macrophages to the lymphatic system, causing inflammation and fibrosis of vessels, obstruction of lymphatic drainage and finally lymphedema and elephantiasis.
It is typically characterized by occurring at high latitudes, where transmission of filariae by mosquitoes does not occur.
Sepsis was performed on the lesion biopsy, which showed granulomatous inflammation with foreign body reaction and polymorphonuclear microabcesses, with no evidence of malignancy.
Some granulomas were focally stained for micro-organisms in a way that showed the presence of yeast-like structures with Splendore hoep phenomenon, positive for PAS, and the honeycombing technique.
All this compatible with ichthyosis was treated with cotrimoxazole 800/160 mg 1 pill 12 hours associated with the pill â¢§©¥ 100 mg 1 pill every 12 hours.
During successive visits, a progressive decrease in the size of the lesion was observed until its clinical resolution.
After 5 months of treatment, MRI of the foot was performed, which determined the existence of a fibrous lesion in the surgical bed of small size, which finally disappeared in control MRI performed one month after antibiotic treatment.
Final diagnosis Achillestoma
