A 39-year-old woman with a history of celiac disease.

She denied travelling, risky sexual contacts, tattoos, consumption of mushrooms or contaminated water.
She denies herbal products, drugs, and drugs.
No pregnancy.
Examination revealed mucocutaneous jaundice and hepatomegaly.
No flapping.
Chest and abdominal X-rays were performed, which were anodyne, analytical with total bilirubin 25 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 21 mg/dl, AST 907 IU/L, ALT 640IU/L and AF 143
INR 2.98.
Normal immunoglobulins.
Serology was negative for all viruses (A,B,C and E), except EBV (IgM and IgG +).
Autoimmunity studies (ANA, antiLKM, anticentromere, antimitochondral and smooth muscle) were negative.
EBV and CMV viral load was requested in the blood and was undetectable.
Abdominal Doppler ultrasound showed heterogenicity of the hepatic parenchyma, with normal bile ducts and portals and minimal ascites.
VBAC results were negative from serological point of view, and transjugular liver biopsy was finally performed, showing a gradient of 12 mmHg and taking samples for sending to Pathology Anatomy (PA) VESH.
While waiting for the results of PA, the patient developed an episode of grade I hepatic encephalopathy, requiring transfer to the ICU.
Given the risk situation; since this was a young female patient with autoimmune disease, and having ruled out the patient's personal and infectious history of liver disease and normalization, coagulation mg was initiated empirically Pre/24one 1
The AP study showed intense portal inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and▁eosinophils and periportal necrosis with stasis.
Portal expansive fibrosis (F2) and ruptured livers were the definitive diagnosis of subacute liver failure secondary to seronegative autoimmune hepatitis.
