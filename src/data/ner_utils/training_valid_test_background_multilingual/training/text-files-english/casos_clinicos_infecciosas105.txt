He had type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension in addition to chronic liver disease with Child Pugh B clinical stage, secondary to hepatitis B virus infection, portal hypertension, esophageal varices and hyperes
The chronic treatment of this patient tenofovir 300 mg vo per day, anaphylaxis 20 mg vo per day, prololac 40 mg vo per day, folic acid 1 mg vo per day, lactulose 30 ml three times a day 100
Regarding their chronic liver disease, she has not had episodes of variceal bleeding and is stable with her last viral load for hepatitis B <10 copies/mL; however, her diabetes has no obvious organ damage HbA1c.
(12) The patient has no relevant epidemiological history except for living in a tropical wet region such as the province of Matanzas.
This patient consulted for 5 months of evolution of dyspnea at rest, cough and hemoptysis.
Tuberculosis was previously ruled out on an outpatient basis, and consultation on this occasion due to exacerbation of its respiratory symptoms, fever and constitutional symptoms.
The patient was admitted with fever, tachycardia, sweating, normotensive, adequate oxygen saturation, without clinical data of hepatic encephalopathy, with cardiopulmonary auscultation without pathological findings, abdomen blushing without ascites.
The chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrate.
Laboratory tests at admission to the emergency service were as follows: Hemoglobin: 13.4 g/dl, Leukocytes 7900/uL, Bandas: 11 %, Creatinine: 21 mg/dl, C-reactive protein: 38 mg/dl
Hemocultives are reported positive in both bottles taken from the upper limbs: 13 and 12 hours respectively, due to Pasteurella abortcida.
In relation to studies in the office, Bronc was performed with culture of bronchial aspirate positive for Streptococcus parasanguis and PCR negative for tuberculosis.
The biopsy result showed undifferentiated lung cancer.
The other laboratory tests obtained during hospitalization do not differ significantly from the initial tests previously noted, it should be noted here that the biomarkers improved completely with the established therapy.
bacteremia presented by the patient is specifically interrogated about contact with pets (cats or dogs), which denies emphatically.
But at home if there is a dog, but he insists that he is out of the house and he does not keep any direct contact with him.

MICROBIOLÉA In the laboratory, patients with haemocultive diseases were received and tested positive at 12 and 13 hours in isolation training equipment (Bact/Alert, bioMé).
Gram stain revealed gram-negative▁cocci.
Subcultivations of each bottle were made in Columbia Medium with 5% sheep blood and chocolate agar (bioMérieux, Marcyl"Étoile, France).
Cholesterol in oxidizing atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hours, obtaining growth of positive small non-hemolytic colonies of▁greyish color corresponding to a gram-cobacillus
Identification in GN card Vitek 2 Compact (bioMérieux, Marcyl"Étoile, France) resulted Pasteurella affected with 95% probability in both isolates.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing in AST279 card (bioMérieux) reports sensitivity for beta-lactam antibiotics, third generation cephalosporam, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and sensitivity to antifungals.
Susceptibility to macrolides was not performed.
