An eleven-year-old girl presented to the allergy department with pruriginous eczema that tended to ulcerate in her forearms in relation to her school contact.
Skin tests were performed on regular inhalants that were negative and analytical, and total IgE was detected: 44.7kU/L (normal).
The school center contacted the municipal health system, who came to the orchard, verifying the presence of insects of 1-2 mm in length, in the orchard, clothes and limbs of several children.
These specimens were sent to the Department of Zoology and Physical Anthropology of the UMU, identifying them as Trips, belonging to the genus Aelotrips Haliday (Aeolothripidae).
The patient then underwent prick by prick with the▁crushed live insects, resulting in a▁papule of 5 mm in diameter: POSITIVO (10 healthy, negative controls).
