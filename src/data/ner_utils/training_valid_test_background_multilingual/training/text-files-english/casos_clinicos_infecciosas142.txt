A 35-year-old male, professional painter, active smoker of a daily pack of tobacco, occasional cannabis consumer and habitual cocaine.
The patient was brought to the Emergency Department by her family members due to a three-week history of confusion consisting of difficulty in naming objects and incoherent realization or confusional everyday activities, disorientation and disorientation.
As the only antecedent of interest, he highlighted a recently held positive HIV serology in his health center, with a confirmatory Western blot slope.
He also complained of intense asthenia with a feeling of unquantified weight loss in the last four months, as well as non-morning cough related to tobacco consumption, with no other symptoms caused by organs and devices.
Physical examination revealed fever,▁malaise, hypertension, chronic bronchitis, heart rate 82 bpm, eupneic with 100% oxygen saturation without supplementation.
Neurologically he was conscious but brachychic and disoriented in time, without signs of neurological focus or meningism data.
At auscultation, generalized hypophonesis was evident.
No other relevant anomalies were observed.
Among the urgently requested laboratory tests, the presence of▁lymphopenia of 830 lymphocytes/μl was highlighted, with normal results in red and platelet series.
C-reactive protein (CRP) showed a value of 6.7 mg/l.
A cranial CT scan showed cerebral white matter hypodensity in both hemispheres, with no mass effect, suggesting leukoencephalopathy of uncertain origin.
In the CSF analysis, only high protein levels of 59 mg/dl were observed, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus were negative.
On chest X-ray, rounded images of calcified walls were observed, the largest of them with air-fluid level inside.
HIV positive and analytical results previously performed by their physician, in which only the mentioned relative▁lymphopenia stood out, with thyrotropin, cortisol, tumor markers and serology for hepatitis B virus negative.
Once these findings were identified, we decided to enter the Infectious Diseases ward to complete the study, starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir (Evitegravir) 150 mg, cholinergic coformin (TA,tric) 200 mg
Determinations of HIV viral load (CV) in plasma and CSF were requested, whose results were 496,000 and 260,000 copies/ml respectively, as well as CD4/μl lymphocyte subpopulations, with 154 CD4/μl lymphocytes.
HLA-B*5701 was positive and no mutations were detected in the study of resistance to antiretroviral drugs.
The serological study against Echinococcus granulosus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii was extended, obtaining only positivity for IgG against CMV.
Brain MRI showed involvement of the bilateral frontal white matter, of the radiated corona extending to the knee and posterior arm of the right internal capsule, patchy in nature, with some degree of lesional confluence.
These lesions appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences, and some of them presented diffusion restriction.
No enhancement areas were observed after intravenous contrast administration.
EEG recordings showed a normal base line interposed by rhythmic sprouts of bifrontal delta activity.
As for the study of pulmonary lesions, a chest CT was requested, which showed multiple cysts of different sizes, with air-fluid level and dense content, without contrast uptake.
Serial sputum culture and smear microscopy, as well as interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis were negative.
Differential diagnosis of HIV-infected patients with neurocognitive abnormalities should include a broad differential diagnosis, both with etiologies common to seronegative patients and with other more specific etiologies in patients infected with this virus.
The following conditions should be highlighted: • Neurological diseases.
Given the patient's age, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease or normotensive hydrocephalia in adults could be considered.
• Pseudodementia secondary to depression.
• Metabolic encephalopathy secondary to ionic changes and poisoning, which in our case were reasonably ruled out.
• Focal or diffuse encephalopathies.
In patients with advanced HIV infection, we can distinguish between these two types of encephalopathy.
Among the former, since CSF had normal outflow pressure and only showed hyperproteinorrhachia with negative microbiological study, most infectious etiologies were ruled out.
In addition, serology for Toxoplasma spp.
was negative, and in the neuroimaging tests no focal lesions with peripheral ring lesions typical of toxoplasmosis or lymphoma or tuberculomas or cryptomas were detected.
However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) would fit the clinical picture and radiological images.
As HIV-associated diffuse encephalopathy, we would have dementia associated with this virus.
As for cystic lung lesions, the first question to be asked is whether we were facing true cysts or other simulating entities such as cavities, centrilobular emphysema or cystic bronchiectasis.
True cysts are defined as rounded areas of air content separated from the lung parenchyma by a thin wall less than 2 mm thick.
According to the location, they are classified as subpleural or intraparenchymal, as in the case of our patient.
These, in turn, are classified into subgroups according to other chest CT findings: • Glass-glass images.
This pattern is typical of cystic pneumonia jirovecii or desquamative interstitial pneumonia.
• Nodules.
They appear in▁lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, amyloidosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, among other entities.
• No additional findings.
Initially, equine diseases could be considered negative, although serology was negative; and in tuberculosis, although serial smears and IGRA tests were negative.
The patients VC showed slow but progressive cognitive recovery, and control CSF HIV infection was detected at 4 weeks after the start of treatment 147,000 copies/ml.
CSF PCR for JC virus was negative.
However, initially, no major changes were observed in the control neuroimaging, remaining pending a new skull MRI.
Pulmonary lesions were treated with fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), obtaining positive polymerase chain reaction for P. jirovecii, subsequently adjusted for oral trimetoxazole (800/16 mg).
Subsequent outpatient follow-up showed a clear improvement of the pulmonary cysts, with complete disappearance after treatment.
Final diagnosis Dementia associated with HIV and▁Pneumonia due to cystis jirovecii.
