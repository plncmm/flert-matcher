An 8-year-old boy was diagnosed with food allergy due to: fish, nuts, legumes, profilin and PR-10, who suffered anaphylaxis after sucking cauliflower and ketchup.
He had previously tolerated dinners, and only had oral allergy syndrome to raw tomato.
Initially, she presented facial edema, urticaria, cough and cleft lip.
The mother administered hydroxycin and ̈formal ̄ to the emergency medical service (EMS).
Despite the availability of a homeowner for self-management, and in view of the proximity of the SEM, it is recommended that no other action be taken.
Upon arrival of the SEM, after initial stabilization, the patient presented sudden loss of consciousness with generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
After that, and during the transfer to the emergency department, the patient remained unconscious (glasgow 9-10).
In the emergency room, horizontal nystagmus, paresis of the VI nerve pair, dysarthria and visual disturbance stood out.
Serum tryptase 6-8 hours after anaphylaxis is 13.1 mcg/L, negative urine toxic and normal brain scanner.
Upon discharge, neurological recovery is complete.
To complete the study: cofactors, prick by prick to ketchup (5 mm), tomato in different forms (between 1 and 5 mm) and cauliflower wounded (6 mm) were discarded.
Basal tryptase 3.7 mcg/L; total IgE 590 IU/ml; specific IgE (k U/L): grape 0.47, cauliflower 2.46.
