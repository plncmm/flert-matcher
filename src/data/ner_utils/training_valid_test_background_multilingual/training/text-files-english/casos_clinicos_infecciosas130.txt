A 76-year-old patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin 850mg and probable interstitial lung disease due to occupational exposure.
The patient was evaluated in the emergency department due to intense asthenia and fever with a bacteriemic profile, with no other symptoms to be highlighted by organs and appliances except for coughing scarcely occurred the previous days.
One week before, she had been admitted to the▁Pneumology Department due to respiratory infection, with a torpid clinical course after discharge.
It was decided to admit the patient to the service with the suspicion of fever of respiratory origin, to extract hemocultives and antibiotic treatment with meropenem and levofloxacin was initiated.
During their hospital stay, E. faecalis, ampicillin-susceptible and aminoglycosides resistant, metronidazole, and Badacillin-resistant penicillin-sensitive and clindamycin are isolated in hemocultives.
She consulted the Infectious Diseases Unit, which recommends de-escalating intravenous ampicillin 2gr/4h, and a CT (computed tomography) of the chest is performed as a liquid consolidation x a 5.5 cm casual finding.
The patient is transferred to the Department of General Surgery for drainage and monitoring of general anaesthesia.
Radioguided puncture and culture of▁exudates were performed, in which E. faecalis was isolated with the same antibiogram described.
With this result, a transthoracic ultrasound (TTE) was requested for the screening of infective endocarditis (IE), without finding pathological findings.
The patient progressed favorably, maintaining the aphid and with an ultrasound control of the bopenazosin which was administered after ten days of antibiotic treatment and metronidazole 23 x 34 mm.
Amoxicillin-Clavulanic 875/125 mg is recommended as an outpatient treatment every 8 hours in association with Metronidazole 500 mg/8h for seven days.
A week later, the patient was readmitted for fever reappearance.
Differential diagnosis Given the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and the analytical results and sarcoidosis by patient, we proposed the differential diagnosis of splenic lesions mainly among the following entities: tumor cause, either infectious cause, metastasis or infectious cause.
The presence of systemic symptoms must always be ruled out, lymphomas being the most probable cause in our case.
Splenic lesions can develop as primary splenic lymphoma or a systemic disease such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic Hodgkin lymphoma,▁lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma
Primary lymphomas of the area occur in 1% of NHL patients over 50 years of age with severe stenosis, lymphocytosis with "mild" lymphocytes, hyperplastic anaemias, and focal sclerosis.
It differs from the rest of NHL due to the absence of lymphadenopathy, extralymphatic organ involvement, elevated B symptoms and LDH.
It is associated with splenic infarction, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and mixed▁cryoglobulinemia.
Other less common malignant tumors are angiosarcoma or metastases, which mainly originate from melanoma followed by breast and lung cancer and which in most cases are accompanied by metastases elsewhere in the abdomen.
At CT, hypodense lesions can be cystic or with a necrotic center with ring enhancement.
From the infectious point of view, splenic lesions may occur in the case of pyogenic abscesses, microabcesses frequently produced by infections caused by tuberculosis orcystis with immunosuppression, acquired granulomas in the context
In the case of tuberculosis (TB), abdominal involvement comprises about 5% of all cases and includes involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, lymph nodes and solid organs such as the spleen whose participation is infrequent.
Approximately 15 to 25% of patients with abdominal TB have concomitant pulmonary TB.
The clinical manifestations depend on the location and may include fever, weight, pain or abdominal distension, such as as ascites, hepatomegaly, diarrhea and abdominal mass. In imaging tests, granulomas are usually detected 5 mm
Splenic abscess is a rare infection whose incidence varies from 0.14% to 0.7% depending on the series of autopsies, and up to 0.9% of abdominal infections2, although there has been an increase in the number of patients in recent years.
The most common contributing factors are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, parenteral drug use or chronic alcohol consumption, medication intake, chronic liver disease or underlying cancer.
However, it is increasingly common to observe abscesses in patients without risk factors, which reflect the complexity of its pathophysiology.
The average age varies from 30 years depending on the studies, with a clear male predominance (63%).
It may be due to three mechanisms: 1) less frequent dissemination of the adjacent urinary tract, representing up to 75% of cases, infectious endocarditis being the most common cause; 2) intrinsic theory or infection after a structural or functional alteration caused by bacteremia; 3)
Abscesses are usually multiple when they are a consequence of dissemination and the frequency of this complication in patients with documented endocarditis could be set at 4.8%.
Clinical manifestations are nonspecific, often present as isolated fever (95% of cases), leading to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay, responsible for its high morbidity (12%) and mortality (47-100%).
The mean time between diagnosis and onset of symptoms is two weeks (2 days to 4 weeks).
The classic triad of Sarr and Zuidema, which associates fever, pain of the left hypochondrium and palpable mass, is present only in about one third of cases-38%.
Other possible symptoms are nausea, weight loss, asthenia, nonspecific abdominal pain and enlarged spleen (40-54% of cases).
Splenic abscess may be accompanied by left pleural effusion or splenic infarction if due to septic embolism.
In the case of our patient, the finding of these abscesses was accidental after asking for a study to rule out a neoplasia in the left lower lobe given the repeated episodes of infections at this level for which he was admitted three times less than two months.
The most commonly involved microorganisms are S. aureus, viridans group streptococci, Salmonella sp and E. coli (and other enterobacteria).
These are rare aseptic abscesses or abscesses produced by other germs (Bartonella spp., Candida spp., Burkholderia pseudomallei, mycobacterial infections or in patients treated with targeted agents).
Diagnosis is based on microbiological isolation and imaging tests.
Hemocultives are more frequently positive in multiple abscesses (70%) than in single lesions (14%).
Culture of the abscess content has a higher sensitivity, estimated from 50 to 80%, although it requires puncture and consequently a higher risk of hemorrhagic complication.
In a chest X-ray, a left pleural effusion or an infiltrate of the left lower lobe may increase the suspicion.
Currently, ultrasound has been abandoned in favor of CT, whose sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of splenic abscesses are estimated at 95 and 92%, respectively, although the lesion can also be classified as a bacterial complication of endocarditis5, as well.
The abscess appears as a hypodense image with a discrete peripheral contrast enhancement that may sometimes be missing.
CT also allows guided puncture, with 5% morbidity and less than 1% for trained equipment.
The risks of surgical puncture are higher, with variable morbidity of 11-28% and mortality of 6-14%.
The possible complications are pleural effusion, hemorrhage, empyema and fistula.
MRI is not routinely performed and is reserved to identify hypervascular lesions due to hemorrhagic complications.
Splenic abscess is usually treated with a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with surgical or percutaneous drainage, as according to some authors, the isolated antibiotic treatment would be associated with a mortality of 30-80%.
Ceftriaxone or ceftriaxone can be administered intravenously together with metronidazole or monotherapy with meropenem or piperacillin-tazodone.
Any of these regimens may be added to an aminoglycoside for the first 3-5 days pending culture results.
Treatment of enterococcal endocarditis is more complex due to the lower sensitivity of enterococci to penicillin and other betalactam antibiotics and their tolerance to the bactericide action of antibiotics.
In our case, given the isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in serial hemocultives and the high suspicion of endocarditis, the treatment of choice is the combination of ampicillin 2g/4h with intravenous ceftriaxicterone 8g/12h, respectively.
In case primary bacteremia is suspected, ampicillin 2g/6h, daptomycin 10mg/kg/day, vancomycin 20mg/kg/8-12h, teicoplanin 600mg/day or
In general, for percutaneous drainage, hemodynamically stable patients are preferred, with single abscesses of 3-4cm size or less, without internal and splenic septa.
Otherwise, or in the absence of alternative treatments or previous therapeutic failure, it would be necessary to resort to hysterectomy, whose role is still under debate.
According to some authors, it would be the only effective way to prevent recurrence of splenic abscess; however, more recent data show the success of therapy in the absence of successful resection, which prevents the risk of infection mortality after surgery.
Among other granulomatous processes, sarcoidosis, a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomatous tissue infiltration, should be considered.
The most common form of involvement is bilateral hiliar lymphadenopathy, reticular pulmonary infiltrates and/or skin, ocular or joint lesions.
The clinical presentation is variable, pulmonary manifestations being the most frequent; systemic symptoms such as asthenia, fever and weight loss are usually more common in patients over 70 years.
Extrapulmonary involvement can occur in all organs and systems in varying proportions and systems, being the spondynic entity manifests as a rare entity involving asymptomatic enlarged spleen (<5%), hyperspecific lesions and granulomatous lesions (15% pancit
For its diagnosis there is no definitive test, requiring: 1) compatible clinical and radiological picture; 2).
Exclusion of other diseases; 3) detection of non-caseating granulomas.
Once the patient was admitted again with febrile episodes, ampicillin therapy was started when Enterococcus faecalis was isolated in previous hemocultives, and ceftriaxone IV 2gr/24 therapy was added.
The patients hemoculptives in two tones on arrival are negative but TTE is requested again due to persistence of suspicion and is finally ruled out, so transesophageal ultrasound is tried again.
After two weeks of therapy, it was decided to perform a computerized positron emission tomography (PET-CT), which shows that discrete incidence is determined by transcurrence and large uptake at splenic level among other locations.
The results of the cultures and pathological anatomy of the sample confirm the presence of abscesses produced by Enterococcus faecalis.
Although both echocardiography (TEE and TTE) were normal, PET-CT showed hyperuptake in the perivalvular aortic area.
Therefore, in the presence of bacteremia confirmed by enterococci, since splenic abscesses could be related to septic emboli, it was decided to perform a complete therapy of endocarditis and administer a total antibiotic regimen of 1500 mg in two days.
Median PET-CT, the etiology of thrombosis in the abdominal aorta artery was also ruled out due to the absence of uptake at this level, so anticoagulation was maintained and the vascular surgery was reviewed.
In addition, this imaging test provided information to reject the presence of neoplasia at the digestive tract level, which was suspected due to the microcytic anemia that our patient suffered, as well as bacteremia caused by Enterococcus faecalis.
After the results of the pathological anatomy of our patient's spleen sample, the absence of granulomas was confirmed.
Although the PET-CT finding of granulomatous thickening in the right hemithorax together with moderate uptake of bilateral hilary adenopathies and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is pending.
The patient has experienced significant clinical improvement during successive revisions in Infectious Diseases Outpatient Clinics, without having presented fever or other symptoms to highlight again.
Final diagnosis Splenic abscess secondary to infective endocarditis caused by E. faecalis.
