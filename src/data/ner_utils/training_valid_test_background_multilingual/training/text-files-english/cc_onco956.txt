Anamnesis After the third cycle, the patient was admitted for grade 3 diarrhea and non-neutropenic fever +6 secondary to left pneumonia. Streptococcus from the mitis group was isolated from hemocultives on all baseline days.
During his stay in the plant, the reassessment by means of (CT) is carried out showing a partial response at the hepatic level, so it is decided, along with General Surgery, to request the hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for excision.
After discharge at the end of August, the patient required early readmission, with symptoms consistent with dyspnea at rest and data of biventricular heart failure.
Physical examination revealed a diastolic murmur in the aortic area and a third cardiac tonus, as well as bilateral crackles that greatly hindered cardiac auscultation and significant bilateral edema with fovea.
‚ñÅComplementary tests A transthoracic echocardiogram was requested to document an aortic valve endocarditis that conditions severe aortic insufficiency with secondary acute pulmonary edema.
