Anamnesis A 15-year-old male patient with a personal history of Belly's syndrome and a 12-year history of renal transplantation, without known drug allergies.
In the current episode, the patient comes to the emergency department for presenting an increase of recurrent pain, with colic characteristics, in the left hemiabdomen of years of evolution.
After birth, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral renal dysplasia, large bladder capacity and paraurethral diverticulum.
In her first week of life, grade IV renal failure was established and she progressively developed obstructive uropathy due to type II posterior urethral valves and urethral stenosis.
At the age of two years old, the patient received peritoneal dialysis treatment and was on hemodialysis for six months.
A year later, a right kidney from an adult cadaveric donor was implanted using a Woodruff neoureterocystostomy.
Since then, it has been treated with intermittent catheterization for patent urachus and with prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus.
At five years of age, a right nephroureterectomy of the native kidney was performed because of several episodes of pyelonephritis and large hydronephrosis of the ectopic ureter, which resulted in an acute dysfunction of the graft.
Four years later she was diagnosed with bladder stones, which was resolved by endoscopic lithotripsy.
Several years later, he began with recurrent urinary tract infections and recurrent pain in the left iliac fossa, in addition to a slow and progressive deterioration of renal function until reaching a creatinine level of 4.78 mg/dl previously glomerular prescriptions/ 1.73.
Physical status A: The patient is 47 kg, has a height of 155 cm, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, and remains afflicted.
The abdomen is blushing and depressible, with its hypotonia already known and pain on palpation of the left hemiabdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation.
▁Complementary tests • At admission, an analytical is performed, highlighting values such as 5.5 mg/dl creatinine, 9.88 mg/dl calcium, 49.3 CRP and 16.12 x 109/l leukocytes.
The patient presented a urine culture with positive results for Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/ml).
• An abdominal ultrasound is performed, in which the renal graft is observed with a mild pyelic ectasia, good vascularization and normal resistance index, as well as right distal ureter distended with three▁calculi inside.
• After these findings, abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed without contrast, with similar results.
Finally, an opaque enema is performed, in which a stop is observed in the proximal region of the sigmoid in relation to low intestinal obstruction.
Diagnosis After the complementary tests performed, the patient was diagnosed with: • intestinal obstruction.
• Ureteral lithiasis of the renal graft.
• Chronic renal failure grade IV.
Treatment Upon admission, the patient is treated with intravenous antibiotics (imipenem) and the treatment is withdrawn.
The sixth day of admission was operated on.
A midline laparotomy was performed, observing a large intestinal loop deformity that develops until a bridle was observed at the descending colon, which is released.
Intestinal derotation is also performed at this level.
After solving the digestive problem, a large bladder is found.
After opening its anterior face, the right ureteral meatus is observed, which eliminates abundant urine, but when trying to catheterize it, a proximal stop appears that can only be overcome with a Teflon guide.
It was decided to perform a meatotomy, after which the stenosis that produced the stop was released and the ureter was catheterized.
After this, the distal ureter was released, observing the imprint of the lithiasis just before the intramural trajectory of the ureter.
A larger▁calculus (1.5 cm) was extracted by performing a bladder perforation and a double catheter. Other smaller stones and more proximal situation were extracted using a 4 F ureteral stent Fogarty®. Finally, a 4 F ureteral catheter was inserted.
The patients evolution was favorable after surgery, with creatinine levels 2 days after the intervention of 5.37 mg/dl.
Antibiotic therapy with imipenem is maintained for 8 days, with negative posterior urocultiva.
The result of the extracted▁calculus was calcium carbonate.
The ureteral stent is removed 8 days after surgery, as well as the bladder catheter.
She was discharged 12 days after surgery, maintaining antibiotic prophylaxis.
A week later, the patient was seen for a review, with a creatinine level of 4.28 mg/dl and normal intestinal transit.
Currently, the patient continues to undergo revisions by the Nephrology Department, starting the study for a new living donor transplant (mother), which will be performed in the predialysis phase.
