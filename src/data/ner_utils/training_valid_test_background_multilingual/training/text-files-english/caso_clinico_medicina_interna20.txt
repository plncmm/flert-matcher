Clinical history/ Anaamnesis: 79-year-old male without known drug allergies, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, dyslipaemia, amlodipine-spondylitis
As a pet, he had two dogs.
He had not traveled recently and denied consuming unpasteurized dairy products.
She came to the emergency room with fever of up to 38oC, chills and thyritone with no clear predominance of a week's clear schedule of deterioration of her general condition and glucose disturbance.
He also had pain in the left hemithorax with pleuritic characteristics and several episodes of hypotension that had forced him to go to the emergency department several times the previous days.
The patient did not present any respiratory, gastrointestinal or voiding symptoms.
Acquirement of tachycardia and hypertension at 120 beats per minute.
Basal oxygen saturation was 98%.
T 38.3o.
Poor general condition, sweating with distal skin coldness.
Eupneic at rest.
No lymphadenopathy was observed due to peripheral palpation or jugular engorgement.
Her arrhythmic tone was multifocal systolic murmur II/IV.
Generalised hypoventilation.
Abdomen and lower limbs showed no significant findings.
No neurological focus or meningeal signs.
▁Complementary tests in the emergency room Laboratory performed at admission showed: hemoglobin (hb): 11.2 g/dl, leukocytes 2.240 x 109/L, absolute neutrophils: 0.750x109/L, 1159/L absolute lymphocytes:
PCR: 70 mg/L.
LDH: 321 U/L.
Hemoglobin bladder
Coagulation and normal gas.
Peripheral blood smears with few polymorphonuclear cells with some cavitations, with predominance of mature and granular lymphocytes, isolated cells of activated aspect.
Chest X-ray: Normal cardiothoracic index.
No condensation images.
Puncture of both bilateral costophrenic sinuses.
Admission diagnosis Non-focused syndrome and routine leukocyte triglycerides screening test performed later. During her stay in the plant, she experienced a rapid decrease in all three series (pancreatic bilirubin and serum ferritin levels), a total increase of 43 ng/dl.
Mantoux and negative quantiferon.
Legionnaires anomaly in urine, pneumococcus and leishmania negative.
Lowestein culture in urine was negative.
Liver and Brucella serology, Salmonella typhi and paratyphi, Risia coronii, Coxiella burn, CMV, ESR, EBV and Parvovirus B19 negative.
HIV negative.
We have a negative urine culture.
Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral pleural effusion and hepatomegaly.
Chest CT showed pleural calcifications, calcified hepatic granulomas and some adenopathies, as well as bilateral pleural effusion with underlying lung collapse.
Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: negative for endocarditis.
Finally, a bone marrow aspirate-biopsy (BM) was performed in which flow cytometry showed the presence of 0.1% of non-monoclonal myeloid cells with maintained▁lymphoid proliferation non-monoclonal CD8 lymphocytes.
Myelogram was inconclusive due to the absence of lumps and low cellularity, although blasts were not observed.
Culture for brucella and mycobacteria was negative.
Histopathological examination confirmed a melanoma type, which was later confirmed with a PCR technique for leishmania.
Differential diagnosis Pancit is defined as a decrease in the normal leukocyte count (< 4.5x109/L), hemoglobin according to age and sex and platelets (<15x109/L).
These findings require an algorithm for differential diagnosis, which should include mainly oncohematologic, autoimmune or infectious causes.
Among the causes,▁neoplasms such as acute leukemias or bone marrow lymphomas should be ruled out, without forgetting distant metastases from other solid tumors.
Other causes highlighted are myelodysplastic syndromes, OM aplasia, myelofibrosis, tricyclic hemoglobinemia, myelooptis shiftox anemia
In general, it will be necessary to perform BM aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of these entities.
Rheumatoid lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the main causes of autoimmune origin that may originate rheumatoid arthritis (among its diagnostic criteria are anemia, leucopenia and thrombopenia) and less frequently, arthritis (AU)
There are numerous causes of infectious origin that course with cites.
For the diagnosis of these, in addition to serological determinations and specific tests of any of them in the laboratory, it will be of great importance to perform a correct anamnesis including information on recent travels, place of origin and place of habitual residence.
Among the causes of infectious origin, we must highlight mainly non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, bacterial brucellosis, such as occipital leishmania virus (HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV, authenticated CMV and mumps).
In addition to these three well-differentiated groups of causes of pancitizen, we could include a fourth group where we would find a miscellaneous cause that we cannot include in the previous classification.
Among them, we highlight the drugs as: medications called classic, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, etc., chemotherapy and radiotherapy, hemophagocytic syndrome and sarcoidosis.
▁Definitive clinical judgement Hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to Leishmania infection in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis treated with anti-TNFα.
Hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected initially in hemophagocytic syndrome. High-dose corticoids and inmusupresor▁cyclosporine A were started, with stabilization of the three series of ferritins and a slight decrease in the number of erythrocytes.
After confirming the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, the patient began treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, with a rapid clinical and analytical response. The pancit leishmaniasis disappeared and ferritin returned to normal within 2 weeks.
During the follow-up period, the patient became asymptomatic, with slow steroid tapering.
After 1 year of follow-up with prednisone doses of 7"5 mg per day, the patient had complete blood count and ferritin levels within normal limits.
