Anamnesis and physical examination This is a 63-year-old patient, professional taxi driver, with personal history of hypertension, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia and non-insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus.
He came to the hospital with a picture of more than a year of evolution of lesions in the face, which he referred to were very pruritic.
In addition, the process worsened with sun exposure and alcohol consumption.
She reported having introduced new treatments, having other relatives affected by a similar dermatosis, living with children or animals, and having traveled abroad in recent years.
He had been treated in the primary care center with several topics whose name did not remember, with occasional improvement, and during the last month with posterior betamethasone keratitis ointment ketoconazole, and with cream
However, the worsening of his symptoms was noticeable during the last weeks, making him unbearable, so he consulted in the emergency department.
▁Dermatological examination showed a profusion of erythematous▁papules with slight scaling dispersed in some area by both sides of the skin, predominantly in the left side.
Some of the lesions presented subtle annular disposition in the periphery of the face, and isolated intermixed vesicles could also be observed.
Diagnosis and treatment Although the initial diagnostic impression was a possible rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis; due to the tendency to annular disposition, although not noticeable, the direct absence of rasOH steroid treatment was decided for some lesions.
During the following two weeks, 1% cream was administered via a local anesthetic, achieving only partial improvement of symptoms once a day.
The culture revealed the growth of Trichopyton Tonsurans, thus the final diagnosis of unknown facial ringworm or Tinea Faciei unknown was established.
Associated with this regimen, the erythema migrans and oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for 4 weeks resolved all skin lesions, as well as pruritus.
