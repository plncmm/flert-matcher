A 72-year-old male with a history of smoking (ex-smoker of 10 cigarettes a day for 30 years), long-standing hypertension with poor home control and history of ischemic heart disease, without previous infarction, revascularized with three years.
She was diagnosed with primary Sjögren's syndrome with usual arthritis sprouts.
She suffered a prostate cancer submitted to radiotherapy and without hormonal blockade for three years and last year she suffered a left femoral deep vein thrombosis, starting anticoagulation with acenocoumarol 4mg which is currently maintained.
The patient was treated with topical salicylic acid for diaazole (6mg), atenol (50mg/day), rosuvastatin (10mg/day), nitroglycerin (5mg/day) and▁paroxetine (40mg/day).
Currently retired and living in urban areas, he lives actively without limitations.
She lives alone, without contact with animals.
The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a fever syndrome of one week duration accompanied by joint pain in the right wrist and ankle, with no other remarkable symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient was hypertensive (TA 160/90 mmHg), with normal heart rate (65lpm),▁malaise and eupneic at rest.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation is normal, as well as abdominal palpation.
He presents swelling, erythema and pain in the back of the right hand at the level of the extensor tendons, as well as in the internal ankle malleolus, with the rest of the normal joint.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis of 23820 cells/μL with neutrophilia of 81% and lymphocytes 32%; elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 234 mg/L; ALT 112.5 IU/4.751 with mild serum creatinine (AST 14dl).
The systematic urine does not present data suggestive of infection and the chest X-ray does not show pulmonary infiltrates or other alterations of interest.
She was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of suspected septic arthritis.
Serial hemocultives were performed, isolated in the two samples of aerobics and in the two samples of anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus zooepidemicus sensitive to penicillin (MIC ≤ 0.12).
Urocultiva was negative.
The patient was reinterrupted to insist on not having direct contact with animals.
Your child has a dog he occasionally sees.
Initially it is treated empirically with ceftriaxone and cloxacillin, which is simplified to ceftriaxone after the microbiological isolation described.
Echocardiographic screening was performed, ruling out valvular heart disease and images suggestive of endocarditis.
Clinical improvement was observed with a decrease in inflammatory signs of both diseases, with no pain in both, although mild edema of the wrist and erythema of the ankle persisted without inflammation.
The laboratory parameters also improved, so the patient was discharged 6 days later with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125mg every 8 hours until completing two weeks of antibiotic therapy.
The control blood culture after 6 days of antibiotic therapy was negative.
The plan is a review in the office and a new blood culture control one week after the end of treatment.
One week later, after discharge, and one day after completing antibiotic therapy, the patient returned to the emergency department again due to sudden disorientation and confusion with dysarthria, and generalized slowing.
He had not fever.
The patient was hypertensive (TA 179/79 mmHg), with normal heart rate (66 bpm), eupneic and afferent.
Cardiopulmonary arrest with no findings.
Neurologically oriented, brachypsychic and neurological exploration revealed left hemianopsia with no other focality.
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis of 13330 cells/μL with neutrophilia of 85%, elevated acute phase reactants (CRP 52.8 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (GSR 170 pg/h) and increased 66 mm
Urgent skull CT scan was performed, which showed a hypodense milimetric focus on the head of the left cauda nucleus with a chronic appearance, with no acute lesions being defined.
Differential diagnosis We are faced with a sudden neurological condition to be associated with a history of infectious arthritis and bacteremia due to S. zooepidemicus, without having completed the prescribed antimicrobial treatment yet.
In the differential diagnosis approach, in view of the suddenness of the clinical picture, we mainly include stroke and infectious etiology.
Our patient has a high burden of cardiovascular risk factors (former history of long-standing arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease), together with objectived neurological oriented smoking (target a severe ischemic heart disease).
Embolic stroke is less likely due to sinus rhythm, although the presence of embolism secondary to intracardiac thrombus could not be ruled out.
On the other hand, the presence of leukocytosis, neutrophilia and elevated acute phase reactants make it necessary to rule out an infectious etiology as the origin of the neurological picture.
Central nervous system infection is a probable cause taking into account the recent diagnosis of infectious arthritis and bacteremia due to S. zooepidemicus.
In fact, although infections by this microorganism are rare, after a bacteremia, there may be dissemination to other organs, with meningitis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, pneumonia or arthritis described.
There are few reports in the literature of meningitis specifically caused by S. zooepidemicus, although on the other hand it is one of the most frequent species within the group C stellatococci causing meningitis3.
The instillation period in humans varies from 1 to 21 days, with a median of 7 days.
At diagnosis, fever and meningeal signs (which our patient did not present) are common, although alterations in mental status, low level of consciousness and stupor may also appear (if present in this case).
Although meningitis, after dissemination due to bacteremia, cannot be ruled out, its appearance after a period of improvement and the neurological focus mentioned above make it necessary to consider another process.
Finally, in a patient with bacteraemia stricture who develops embolism neurological focus, the main diagnosis to consider is the presence of septic cerebral embolism secondary to infectious endocarditis.
The patients evolution was favorable and he was admitted to the Neurology ward with initial suspicion of acute stroke.
This diagnosis is confirmed by a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which shows an alteration in signal intensity (hyperintense on T1, with increased perilesional signal intensity affecting a right lobe with a circumacute ischemic bleeding in a microlobe).
Patched involvement and disorientation suggest embolic etiology.
As an embolic source study, a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested, which showed an echogenic, pedunculated image of erratic posterior movement to very ventricular septal defect suggestive of atrial septal defect, irregular contour valve and 17x10mm.
Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone 2g daily was then initiated with simultaneous extraction of hemocultives without fever.
The diagnosis is confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography that confirms the vegetation of 18x10mm on the auricular side of p2 festival of the mitral valve, with prolapsed movement in the left mitral valve and conditioning regurgitation.
In the case reported with Cardiac Surgery, intervention was ruled out because the mitral valve did not present any structural damage.
The patient presented a good clinical evolution, presenting with fever and hemodynamic stability throughout the hospital stay.
After one week of treatment there was a decrease in acute phase reactants (CRP 6.5 mg/dl, ESR 55 mm/h).
When corticosteroid treatment is withdrawn, which the patient usually takes for his Sjögren's syndrome, he again presents a non-floating swelling on the back of the right hand with redness.
MRI of the right hand is performed with tenosynovitis of the extensors of the fingers and signs of arthritis of the radius and cubitus with the corresponding defect, which improves with reintroduction of the surrounding face.
Antibiotic treatment initiated with ceftriaxone 2g IV daily was decided to maintain for 6-8 weeks (CMI Cefotaxime ≤1).
She was discharged three weeks after the start of antibiotic therapy to continue outpatient treatment.
Control hemocultives were repeated with negative results and echocardiogram without changes persisting even the vegetation adhered to the mitral valve.
The patient completed the treatment for 8 weeks without incidents, and a new control echocardiogram was performed 4 months later without images suggestive of endocarditis.
Blood cultures one month after the end of treatment are also negative and are discharged from the Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Final diagnosis • Infectious endocarditis on native mitral valve caused by Streptococcus zooepidemicus.
•▁Right occipital stroke of embolic etiology secondary to endocarditis.
• Autoimmune arthritis of the right wrist.
