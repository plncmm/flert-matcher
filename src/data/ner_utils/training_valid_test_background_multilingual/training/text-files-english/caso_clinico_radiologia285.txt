A 70-year-old man presented with fever of unknown origin and pain in the stool.
She suffered from metastatic rectal cancer and had started chemotherapy 3 days earlier.
X-rays were performed and a CK level of 1600 mg/dl was obtained, as well as a CRP level of 20 mg/L, which was attributed to a rare post-QT pelvis infection.
After 12h, an erythematous and extensive lesion appeared on the inner thigh, dysesthesias and CK of 6000 mg/dl with CRP 40 mg/L, leukopenia, hypotension and fluctuations in consciousness.
Cranial and pelvic CT + LLLL was requested.
On admission X-ray, abundant gas apparently located between the muscle fibers of the iliac muscle and proximal muscles of the right side was observed.
The non-contrast tomography (due to its renal failure) confirms the X-ray findings showing the presence of gas between the muscle fibers and fascias of the pelvic muscles and right thigh, inflammatory signs and edema affecting the fat adjacent to the muscle.
Findings in relation to Facial infection/necrotizing myositis.
The skull study was normal.
The patient died after 3 hours of CT. Staphiloscopherol and Clostridium septicum were debridemented and 12 hours later.
