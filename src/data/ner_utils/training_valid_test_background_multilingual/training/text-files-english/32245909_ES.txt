On February 12, 2020, days before this event was identified, an 80-year-old woman with a three-year history of left ulcerative colitis and maintenance treatment with fever and hemorrhagic diarrhea developed in our clinic.
On admission, the patient reported four stools a day with blood and fever of up to 38.5 °C.
Laboratory tests showed severe anemia (hemoglobin 7 g/dL) and high levels of C-reactive protein (6 mg/dL).
A sigmoidoscopy showed large and deep ulcers in the sigmoid colon and rectum.
Stool cultures were negative, including tests for Clostridum difficile.
The patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis recurrence and started treatment with IV corticosteroids.
(methylprednisolone 40 mg/day).
During the following three days, the frequency of stools decreased, fever subsided, and C-reactive protein values returned to the normal range.
On the fourth day, the patient presented fever of up to 39 °C which progressed with dry cough.
Based on constantly evolving data on the sprout of SARS-CoV-2, including information on nosocomial infections, a case of COVID-19 was diagnosed.
A chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumonia, confirmed by chest CT.
Nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was established.
The patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation and a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine.
IV corticosteroids
oral prednisone was rapidly substituted and a progressive dose reduction was initiated.
Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition worsened and died after 14 days of hospitalization.
At the time of death, the prednisone dose was 25 mg daily.
