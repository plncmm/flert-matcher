We report the case of a 73-year-old man with a skin lesion on his back attributed to a sting 10 days before, while working in an orchard of the community of Madrid in August.
A few days later, the patient developed fever of up to 39°C and new skin lesions on the trunk and extremities, with no response to treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
The physical examination revealed black color in the left back region of the lumbar spine and a rash erythematous in trunk and extremities.
The rest of the examination was normal.
No relevant findings were found in the blood analysis.
With the clinical suspicion of ritesiosis, blood was drawn for serological study and samples of the rash were taken for histological examination and analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a reference laboratory.
Treatment with oral contraceptive (100mg/day for 7 days) was prescribed, with progressive improvement until complete resolution without sequelae.
Serology in acute phase by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) showed low titers of immunoglobulin (Ig) G against cryptosia conorii, and negative for IgM.
A new serology performed 4 weeks later showed no variations.
Skin biopsy showed▁lymphocytic infiltrate and vasculitis phenomena.
The PCR study of cutaneous biopsy detected the presence of cryptosia sibirica mongotimonae.
We describe a new case of cryptosiosis caused by cryptosia sibirica mongolonae in Spain, with the peculiarity that the diagnosis was made by PCR in skin biopsy of the exanthema and not of it.
