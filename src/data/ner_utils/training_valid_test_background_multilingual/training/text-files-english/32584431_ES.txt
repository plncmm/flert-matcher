A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of fever (38.5°C), followed by chest pain and skin rash.
He had tachycardia (120 l.p.m.)

The thoracic and abdominal examination was normal.
Skin examination revealed a rash consisting of slightly erythematous confluent macules affecting the trunk and extremities.
In palms and soles, macules are clearly defined areas of erythema, and skin islands are not affected.
Chest radiography and chest CT did not show relevant results.
An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse ST-segment elevation; troponin T value was 367 ng/L.
The electrocardiogram showed normal ventricular activity, with no signs of pericardial effusion.
Acute myopericarditis was diagnosed.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (18.2 x 10 9/L) with 6% lymphocytes and normal values of hemoglobin, thrombocytes and lactate dehydrogenase.
The values of C-reactive protein (23.10 mg/L), dementia (10.95-0 ng/mL) and fibrinogen (974 mg/dL) were high.
Tests for autoimmune diseases were negative.
Serological tests ruled out infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-associated cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie virus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis A-B-Cum virus, Treponema.

Treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone, low molecular weight heparin,▁acetylsalicylic acid, pantoprazole, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir.
Antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine were discontinued after 2 days due to nausea, diarrhoea and anaemia.
The patient was started on colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily), with complete resolution of the skin lesions, normalization of the ECG and progressive apyrexia.
