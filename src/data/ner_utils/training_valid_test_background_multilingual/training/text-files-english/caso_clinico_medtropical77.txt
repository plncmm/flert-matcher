A 48-year-old woman, diabetic and from Bagua, Amazonas Region, Peru.
It was diagnosed as a lesion of more than 10 years that began in the middle zone of the thumb.
The patient presented erythema, pruritus, desquamation, black spots and occasional pain in the distal region of the thumb.
Hycaea sp., erythematous-squamous lesion; muriform cells at 400 magnification; dark green radiated colonies at 10 days of tapering; and dry agar at 400 tapering.
Direct examination with 10% potassium hydroxide revealed the presence of muriform cells suggestive of▁chromoblastomycosis.
In the culture, dark green 14 mm radiated colonies were observed 10 days after inoculation, which was identified by microcultivative technique and microscopy as "damaged" sp.
Pathological studies showed hematocrit 43.2%, hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL, leukocytes of 7620 c/mm3 and▁eosinophils (305 c/mm3).
Additionally, serology for Chagas, HIV and HTLV were negative.
The patient was treated with itraconazole 100 mg every 12 h for two months.
However, a control culture showed viability of the wound.
The patient abandoned the subsequent treatment and subsequent controls, which is why it did not allow to observe the evolution of the disease.
