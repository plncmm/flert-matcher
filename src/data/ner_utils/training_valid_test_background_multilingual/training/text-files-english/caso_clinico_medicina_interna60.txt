Anamnesis A 61-year-old male smoker of 1 bp/day (had been smoking 3 bp/day) for more than 40 years and occasional drinker, with history of cervical hernias treated conservatively,
The patient is admitted urgently to prioritize studies from the outpatient clinic of internal medicine after being diagnosed with a probable masked syndrome in ophthalmology, and should rule out as a first option a primary tumor.
The patient loses in June 2013 part of the vision of the right eye, without being valued for this until January 2014, when it is derived to the specialist in retina, who is currently diagnosed with probable OD syndrome in February 1.
▁Throughout this time period, vision has not changed with respect to loss during the past month of June.

Image compatible with a 10 mm angioma in segment seven.
Adenoma images in adrenal paths
Normal right kidney.
Left renal hydronephrosis with very thin cortical produced by an intraureteral mass of 6 cm in length.
To rule out lung cancer with mediastinal adenomegaly and/or metastasis of a tumor of the airways.
· Abdominal ultrasound: Left kidney with high grade hydronephrosis, with large dilation of the proximal ureter, calcaneus and hydronephrotic parenchyma balls.
Not free fluid.
Rest of structures within normal limits.
· skull MRI: preserved midline.
There are many rounded lesions of high intensity T2 and low T1.
The largest of them has a diameter of 9mm.
They are located in both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, right cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem.
Platelet cysts present minimal perilesional edema in the FLAIR sequence.
Notable thickening (3.8mm) of the posterior pole of the right eyeball probably related to the chorioretinitis mentioned.
Findings suggesting multiple brain metastases, especially after TAC-abdominal.
Diagnosis Masked Syndrome (diffuse▁choroiditis + papillitis) as the first manifestation of left urinary tract tumor with metastasis to the lung and CNS.
Treatment and evolution After more than 10 days in Internal Medicine, with hydronephrosis that causes ureteral injury visualized by ultrasound and with the deterioration of renal function, it was decided to transfer to the Urology Department.
In Urology performed endoscopy and biopsy.
She was discharged one week after being in charge of Urology with a patent nephrostomy catheter, with persistence, and even mild worsening of renal failure (Cr 1.86 and FG 39), with hemodynamically stable urine.
Ten days after discharge, the results of pathological anatomy were obtained, which reported the compatibility of samples with urothelial tumor origin through ureteral lavage.
One month later, the patient was referred to the physician's office where chemotherapy was prescribed with Carboplatin and Gemcitabine, given the extent of the disease and its poor prognosis.
