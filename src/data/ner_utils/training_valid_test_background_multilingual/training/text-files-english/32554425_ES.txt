A 65-year-old man came to the emergency department with fever, fatigue and cough for 5 days.
Initial blood analysis showed inflammatory syndrome with high levels of C-reactive protein mg/L, bicytic anemia (normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia), and▁lymphocytic colitis (60.
The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward for evaluation.
A non-contrast-enhanced chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacities, characteristic of COVID-19 infection.
The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.
The next day, the patient developed high fever and chills.
A rash was also seen in the lower limbs.
Severe hypoxemia (56 mm Hg) and low oxygen saturation (90.6%) led to conservative therapy with high concentration mask (15 L/min) and antibiotic therapy (espiramycin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid).
Since oxygen saturation continued to decrease to 88%, with worsening of the rash and tachypnea, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of pulmonology.
Rapid pulmonary stabilization with oxygen was achieved in the intensive care unit; however, the patient continued to feel dizzy despite interrupting sedation.
Brain CT and MRI were performed to look for possible neurological complications, such as hypoxic ischemic lesions or encephalitis.
The CT scan showed multiple cerebellar hypodensity, white matter and basal▁ganglia, as well as bilateral hyperdensity of the pale globe, all of which were indicative of bleeding, confirmed by MRI.
Brain MRI showed extensive ischemic lesions, with limited diffusion, affecting the semioval center, corpus callosum, basal▁ganglia and cerebellum, with patchy/punctuated enhancement.
A 3D frontal reconstruction using MRA of the supraaortic arteries showed no detectable anomalies of the intra- or extra-craneal vessels.
