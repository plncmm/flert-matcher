Hycarvopathy and right ventricular response. Re-evaluation CT (04-03-15) of the LSD mass in partial response range, complete response of right paratracheal lymph nodes
It presents as side effects visual alterations in the form of aura with predominance in the evening.
After 2.5 months of tto.
with CRIZOTINIB PET CT (13-04-15) was performed: complete metabolic response of mediastinal and hiliar lymph nodes with partial tumor response was observed.
This response was referred to the patient of the Thoracic Surgery Department for surgical assessment after mediastinoscopy was performed.
