Anamnesis A 31-year-old woman, with no toxic habits (sporate alcohol consumption), with mild hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia.
She has 4 dogs, 2 cats, and she's a flower blossom.
Three months before she had a fever (up to 40 oC) and vomiting, for which she took antibiotic and antiemetic treatment, which resolved in 3 days.
After 2 weeks she presented a new emetic syndrome and abnormal urinary sediment, receiving a new antibiotic tandem.
It is evaluated by a gastroenterologist for a new 3-day picture of vomiting accompanied by cramps in the upper limbs without fever.
Abdominal ultrasound showed no pathological findings.
The cramps were found to be an electrolyte disorder due to vomiting and treatment with domperidone and pantoprazole was stopped.
Four days later, the patient came to the Emergency Department due to persistent distal tracheas and cramps.
With no neurological focus on the examination, the patient was discharged and referred for further evaluation by the specialists of the digestive tract.
The next morning, the patient began with generalized weakness of left and inferior predominance, alteration of the left foot and difficulty in urination, so she went to the emergency room again.
He did not report headache, infectious-febrile syndrome or recent vaccines, ̄s phenomena, photosensitivity, oral/genital aphthous ulcers, arthritis/ arthralgia, serositis, visual disturbances, skin seizures.
Physical status Afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
Normal level of consciousness, nuchal▁rigidity without other meningeal signs.
Normal cranial nerves.
Mild IV/V tetraparesis in the right limbs and III/V in the left, without amyotrophy or fasciculations.
Bone-tendon osteotendinous, cutaneous-abdominal and signs of Hoffman and Babinsky bilaterally present.
Tactoalgesic hypoesthesia in the right upper limb (DUL) and level from D8 predominantly left.
Vibratory viability and preserved arthrokinetics.
Inaccuracy in fingernail with MSD.
Negative Romberg and paretic gait left.
Neurological and general examination was normal.
Additional tests • Complete blood count, basic coagulation, biochemical tests, vitamin B12, folate and thyroid hormones: normal.
• Infectious serologies in blood (HIV, HCV, HBV, Herpesvirus, Mycoplasma, Borrellia, Brucella), HSV PCR, enterovirus and tuberculosis: negative.
• Anti-AQP4: negative.
• Serum ACE: normal levels.
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study: clear, 17 cm H2O of pressure, without blockages.
Biochemistry: leukocytes 10/mm3, leukocytes 155/mm3 (neutrophils 15%, lymphocytes 85%), proteins 125 mg/mm, glucose 49 mg/dl, lactic acid 2.3 mmol/l.
Serologies VDRL, FTA, Mycoplasma, Borrellia, ESR 1 and 2, CMV, EBV and VZV: negative.
Culture, Gram stain, agglutination and Chinese ink: negative or without microorganisms.
BOC: negative.
• Immunological study: ANA positive, homogeneous pattern 1/160; anti-DNA 181 U/ml; antihistones positive; anticardiolipins IgG and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein IgG positive, antiphosphoglidin negative; NACA negative;
• Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray: normal.
• Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium: small right frontal venous angioma.
• spinal cord MRI.
Hyperintense from the apex junction to D6 in sagittal magnetic resonance T2 sequence, with patchy areas of gadolinium uptake in T1.
• Neurophysiological study: somatosensory evoked potentials: delayed spinal cord conduction from the left posterior tibial nerve; normal visual evoked potentials and brainstem.
Diagnosis Longitudinally extensive cervical-dorsal myelitis secondary to undifferentiated autoimmune disease: probable systemic lupus erythematosus.
Treatment consists of rapid onset and significant clinical involvement, as well as MRI and CSF findings, and the patient is admitted to the LVU for monitoring, with no clinical progression in the following hours.
Antibiotic and antiviral coverage was initiated to rule out infectious etiology, which was suspended after CSF results and the absence of other infection data.
The immunological profile suggested an inflammatory-demyelinating origin and daily boluses of megadoses of corticosteroids were administered for 5 days.
Concomitantly with Rheumatology, treatment with prednisone tappering was continued until maintenance doses.
Pathologic agents were treated with gabapentin and later or xbazepine due to lack of efficacy.
The patients evolution improved rapidly after treatment.
Upon discharge, the patient did not show motor impairment and showed marked improvement.
The patient was followed up by Neurology and Rheumatology.
At 3 months, she had distal dysesthesias (upper limbs and multiple-level knife) and dystonic flexor episodes in her hands, which improved with antiepileptic medication.
At present, spinal MRI shows hypersignal in the bulbomedullary junction, C6 and C7.
Brain MRI showed no changes.
After 20 months, she continued treatment with prednisone and antiepileptic drugs.
She did not present new neurological or systemic symptoms; dysesthesias persisted in the left upper limb and pectoral area.
A decrease in complement has been associated with altered immunological parameters, without other analytical alterations.
