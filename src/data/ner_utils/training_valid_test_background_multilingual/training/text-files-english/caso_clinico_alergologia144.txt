A 16-year-old male with a history of peanut anaphylaxis presented anaphylaxis after ingestion of a fenugreek.
Prick: 10x20 mm peanut, 6x8 mm natural fenogrec, Lentil 2 mm, Soy 2 mm, Alubia negative, Histamine 5 mm.
Specific serum IgE values: Cacahuete 84 kU/L (Ara h1 34.5 kU/L, Ara h2 60.9 kU/L, Ara h3 2.41 kU/L,
Molecular mass study of specific IgE-binding proteins (SDS-PAGE-Immunoblotting): peanut extract (crude and toasted): 75 kDa 1921, 63 kDa
▁Fenugreek extract: band between approximately > 97kDa-30 kDa, 21 kDa and 19 kDa.
Cross-reactivity study by SDA-PAGE-immunoblotting-inhibition technique with solid phase▁phenogrec extract: Crude peanut extracts and IgE tosted fixation in extract completely inhibit
▁Fenugreek extract does not inhibit IgE binding on itself.
Study location: 63 kDa band detected in peanut extract could correspond to 7S globulin Ara h 1.
Bands of 21 and 19 kDa detected in peanut extract could correspond to 2S albumins Ara h 2.01 and Ara 2.02, bands of the same molecular mass of▁phenoc extract are observed.
It has been shown that in the patient's serum IgE is cross-reacted with fenugreek and peanut proteins.
