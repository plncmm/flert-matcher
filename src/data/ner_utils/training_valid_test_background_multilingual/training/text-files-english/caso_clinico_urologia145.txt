Anamnesis A 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension treated with enalapril.
She came to the emergency department with a clinical picture of 4 days of evolution characterized by fever peaks of up to 38.5 °C associated with bilateral orchialgia, which did not respond to initial treatment with oral ciprofloxacin.
Physical examination revealed consciousness and oriented temporospatially, with signs of mild coughing, tachycardic (126 bpm), blood pressure 143/91 mmHg and fever (38 °C).
In the genital region, a necrotic area of 5 x 7 cm was observed at the base of the scrotum with sloughs and purulent secretion, associated with significant edema and bilateral flushing with extension proximal to the inguinal region.
The rest of the physical examination showed no pathological findings.
Additional tests • Analytically, the patient had leukocytosis of 22,600/mm3 with neutrophilia of 90.5% with CRP of 23.4 mg/l.
Glucose 156 mg/dl, creatinine 0.65 mg/dl, urea 31.3 mg/dl.
The urinary sediment showed three crosses glycosuria.
• Testicular ultrasound showed thickening of the wall and thickening, as well as a heterogeneous hypoechoic image compatible with an abscess with multiple hyperechoic foci with posterior inguinal hernia extending to subcutaneous gas.
▁Right test with slight enlargement and vascularization.
Findings suggestive of Fournier's hypersensitivity.
Diagnosis The diagnosis of Fourniers hypersensitivity was established according to the clinical features and complementary tests.
Treatment The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical lavage and emergency debridement, with abundant purulent material and vaginal dryness. Periectesticular tissues were▁resected from periurethral testicles, dissected the periurethral space.
A transverse incision was made in the left iliac fossa at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine, where the subcutaneous cellular tissue was debrided showing the external aponeurosis of the muscle.
The necrotic scrotum was▁resected to viable margins.
No impairment of noble structures, such as testicles, urethra, or bodies with malformations was observed.
Combined antibiotic therapy, gentamicin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone was established, as well as a daily regimen of local cures with potassium permanganate and tapered water.
Twelve hours later, the patient was evaluated again by surgical debridement, which extended non-viable skin resection.
The gram of the material obtained in the operating room showed mixed flora with Gram-positive▁cocci in chains and couples of the stellaptococcal type, gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcal gram-positive▁cocci.
Culturing and building a multisensitive Streptococcus anginosus predominant.
No growth of anaerobic germs was evidenced in the usual culture media.
CRP and leukocytes patient presented a satisfactory evolution, with resolution of the systemic inflammatory response, given by the absence of new febrile peaks and decrease of inflammatory parameters with analytical on the third postoperative day of 72% with neutrophils/mm3.
After 3 weeks of evolution, the scrotum skin was reconstructed with a meshed skin graft obtained from the right anterior region of the thigh, which evolved adequately.
