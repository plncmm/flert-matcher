Anamnesis 32 years old man with history of recurrent gallstones.
No toxic habits.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
No other history.
The patient was seen in the emergency room in June 2014 due to a 2-month history of progressive dysphagia, mainly for solids, and dyspnea on great exertion in the last 15 days.
Pharmacovigilance Plan
Hemodynamically stable.
Eupneic.
Adrenal tumor is located approximately 10 cm in diameter.
Stridor on tracheal auscultation.
No symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome.
Indirect laryngoscopy performed in the emergency department showed no abnormalities.
Cardiac arrest was normal.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed fixed sounds.
Abdomen and extremities: no alterations.
▁Complementary tests During your study in the Emergency, Resuscitation and Hematology Services: » Chest X-ray (5/6/2014): upper mediastinal widening.
» CT CTAP (5/6/2014): 11 x 16 x 5 cm cervicothoracic mass.
The anterior▁mediastinum is located below the thyroid, with which it is unrelated.
The mass displaces and▁compresses the tracheal lumen, which has a minimum diameter of 4 mm.
Impression of the superior vena cava with abundant collateral venous circulation in the muscles paralysis.
There was no evidence of pulmonary metastasis or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
» Mediastinal mass BAG (5/6/2014): PA of germ cell tumor: seminoma.
» Immunohistochemistry (IHQ): - Oct-4, D2 and C-Kit and PLAP: positive in tumor cells.
- CD-20 and CD79a: positive in B lymphocytes.
- CD3: positive in▁lymphoid population B.
- CD30, CD138, EMA, AE1/AE3 and alpha-fetoprotein: negative.
With these results, the Medical Ongoing Service decided to continue its study on June 10, 2014: » Testicular ultrasound (11/6/2014): both testicles are homogeneous and with normal vascularization.
Simple 2 cm cyst in the head of the right epididymis
» Functional tests: severe/very severe obstructive airway obstruction with amputation of the inspiratory flow/volume curve compatible with fixed tracheal obstruction already known by CT.
Bronchodilator test (+).
» Analytical (11/6/2014): platelets 305,000, leukocytes 16200 (neutrophils 13400), LDH 653 IU/l, glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium within normal limits.
Alpha-fetoprotein (11/6/2014) 1,431, beta-HCG (12/6/2014) 901.7, normal values for ferritin, folic acid, vitamin B12, beta-2 microglobulin anti-thyroid hormones, antibodies against TP.
Serology for HBV, HCV and HIV negative.
Coagulation: normal, fibrinogen 509.
Diagnosis: Extragonadal mixed mediastinal germ cell tumor.
Prognosis was poor according to the IGCCCG classification.
Treatment With the diagnosis of mixed extra-germ germ cell tumor, the chemotherapy cycle is initiated with intention according to the BEP scheme (bleomycin 30 IU 1, 8, 15 + CD2DP 20 days first-5 mg/m2 cycle).
Allopurinol treatment is started to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
a Tumor progression stage: four cycles of TCA of reevaluation day 24/9/2014, partial tracheal response, so we present a case in the thoracic surgery committee on October 9, 2014; we want to
On 10/14/2014 PET-CT was performed, showing that the anterior cervicothoracic mass presents markedly irregular metabolic activity with areas of absence of metabolic activity along with areas of high hypermetabolism (maximum SUV 9,5).
Thus, with the diagnosis of intensely unresectable tumor on PET, chemotherapy is proposed according to the TIP scheme.
On 10/16/2014, in consultation, the patient presents an increase in mass size at supraclavicular level, asking for a second opinion in another center, where they consider this tumor resectable.
On November 6, 2014 a complete macroscopic resection (PA) was performed: residual lesion of malignant teratoma, with presence of areas of severe dysplasia of epithelium and at least a limited focus of possible carcinomatous transformation.
IHC: intense positivity for AE3/AE1 cytokeratin.
Ki-67% in the most mature areas.
Positivity for CEA.
Lightly positive TPA in the entire epithelium).
In the TAP revision CT after surgery, there was a significant decrease in the involvement of the precardiac anterior▁mediastinum, as well as in the involvement of the superior vena cava.
Since there is no residual viable germ cell tumor, the patient does not need complementary chemotherapy and is currently under strict follow-up in our center.
