Anamnesis A 75-year-old man with a personal history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperuricemia, acute myocardial infarction in 2000 presented with a progressive Taptilian by multiple burns in July 1, 1992.
She also referred to a medical emergency.
In the previous 15 days, the patient had been treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for voiding syndrome with systematic pathological urine, compatible with urinary tract infection (UTI).
Upon arrival to the emergency department, there was a worsening in renal function parameters (creatinine 1.65 mg/dl) with hyperkalemia (K+ 6 IU/l), with no evidence of leukocytosis.
Given the clinical-analytical findings, an abdominal ultrasound is requested, which shows the presence of bladder detrus muscle hypertrophy with little urgent bilateral obstructive fighting replenishment grade III without evidence of necrosis.
She was admitted to the Urology Department for bilateral urgent urinary diversion.
During the procedure, a bladder with very edematous walls is evident in the cyst, which prevents proper visualization of the ureteral meatus, preventing bilateral▁retrograde catheterization.
A few hours later, and after placement of the catheter while waiting for a new catheterization through percutaneousostomy, radiological control of nephrotic syndrome on the right side is evident.
Due to the persistence of the left uropathy, it was decided to perform a left urinary diversion by percutaneous nephrostomy.
In the immediate postoperative period she was admitted to the ICU due to a clinical picture compatible with severe sepsis of urological origin, accompanied by hypotension, leucopenia and coagulopathy, with positive urine culture for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli.
Physical examination upon arrival to the hospital revealed a painful abdomen due to palpation of the left hypochondrium, with voluntary defense.
No signs of peritonitis, with negative Murphy and Blumberg.
RHA positive.
▁Complementary tests • Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen without contrast: obstructive hydronephrosis grade III without identifying distal cause.
In the pelvic portion of the right ureter there is a change in caliber that coincides with a zone of greater tortuosity of the same, without observing proximal dilation or apparent distal obstructive cause.
• Urine cytology: ices
• Cystoscopy: decreased bladder capacity.
A wrapping, trabeculated, right ureteral meatus of wide mouth, which can be accessed with cyst, reflowing.
No left ureteral meatus was visualized.
• Ureterocystography + antegrade pyelography: stricture in the ureter-vesical junction that conditions grade III ureterohydronephrosis with small passage of contrast into the bladder.
▁Right vesicoureteral reflux
Diagnosis Microbladder secondary to multiple bladder TURP, which causes right vesicoureteral reflux.
Left ventricular septal defect (LND) associated with hydronephrosis grade III.
Treatment A laparoscopic augmentation enterocystoplasty using single port access (LESS) was performed in November 2011, after evaluating the case in a joint clinical session of the Department.
Dissection of the anterior bladder face was performed, separating it from the anterior abdominal wall and thus separating it from the Retzius space.
Subsequently, a transumbilical approach is extended to extract a segment of the loop of the ileum, which will serve for enterocystoplasty.
Subsequently, intestinal transit reconstruction with mechanical suture (GIA + TEA) was performed.
The segment of the ileum selected for bladder augmentation was detubulized using an electric scalpel, with subsequent transverse opening of the entire bladder dome, leaving the mucosa exposed.
Finally, continuous suture of the intestinal loop to the bladder was performed by continuous V-lock 2-0 suture.
The total surgical time was 3.5 hours, with an estimated blood loss of about 200 ml and the need for intraoperative transfusion of a concentrate mental disorders, the patient's basal anemia upon admission.
The patients condition remained stable hemodynamically during his stay in the ward.
You have correct diuresis through left nephrostomy and urinary catheter.
Abdominal drainage with progressive debital reduction, which was removed on the ninth day, and was discharged due to good evolution.
He was readmitted after 8 days of stay at home for acute pyelonephritis, which resolved favorably with intravenous antibiotic treatment.
The bladder catheter was removed 30 days after surgery and a left nephrostomy was performed at 3 months.
Four months later, the patient has not presented any new episodes of UTI, reporting occasional irritative symptoms that at the present time has become irritable.
