A 78-year-old man with dyslipidemia came to our emergency department after 4 days of fever, with no further symptoms.
The clinical examination was normal except for a temperature of 2oC.
The laboratory tests showed▁lymphocytic colitis and increased fibrinogen, LDH and Difficulty D. The chest X-ray showed multilobular interstitial opacities in the right lung.
On admission, piperacillin/tazo asbestos, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone and enoxaparin were started at a dose of 60 mg per day.
48 hours later, the patient continued with persistent fever and increased oxygen requirements.
The chest X-ray showed rapid progression of opacities and a significant increase in acute reactants such as ferritin and IL-6 was detected, so that a single 600 mg dose of tocilizumab was administered according to the severity protocol.
On day 5 of admission (9 days from the onset of symptoms), the patient showed a clear improvement in the last 72 h, with a decrease in C-reactive protein and ferritin values.
In spite of an initial decrease, the Δημητ increased considerably to 3570μg/L.
CT angiography showed multiple segmental pulmonary embolisms, multilobular pneumonia and three floating thrombi in the aortic arch and descending aorta.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered at an anticoagulant dose.
Coagulopathy or bleeding episodes were not diagnosed.
The patient worsened due to severe respiratory failure and died on day 18 of hospitalization.
