A 42-year-old male patient, with no relevant morbid history, suffered an occupational accident while handling assemblies, passing on a rock with his vehicle, receiving a blow and axial compression in which he was referred back pain.
The pain is hospitalized and controlled medically, partially remitting.
The fourth dta presented fever associated with compromised general status, so a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine was performed, which is not available, showed herniated nucleus pulposus associated with central colected space L5-S.
The development of laboratory tests is shown in the table in the Annex.
Initially, ESR was observed: 77 mm, CRP 243.05 and leukocytes 4.600 with left shift. Empirical antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone, metronidazole and gentamicin was started; fever started 48 hours after antibiotic treatment.
Staphylococcus aureus (SAMS) sensitive to cloxacillin was isolated in the hemocultives, so its antibiotic treatment was modified to cloxacillin 2 g c/6 ev plus cefazolin complete scheme 1g.
Three weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient was referred to our center for management by a spinal team.
A new MRI of the lumbar spine was performed, showing an image compatible with a posterior epidural abscess that, when analyzed in relation to the previous images, allowed us to suggest that initially it was a hematoma in relation to L5-S1 HNP, which was later traumatic.
Intravenous treatment was maintained, discarding the option of surgical treatment due to asymptomatic antibiotic tapering within 1/12 weeks of neurological completion. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit, with parameters of cefoxime 6
