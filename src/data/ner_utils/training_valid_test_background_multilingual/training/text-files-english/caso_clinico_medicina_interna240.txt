A 44-year-old male, born in Morocco, smoker 1-2 cig/day.
Work in kindergarten.
No other relevant personal or family history.
The patient is evaluated in the internal medicine outpatient clinic for a 2-week history consisting in the presence of nodular erythematous facial lesions.
The patient was diagnosed with late-onset HIV infection (CD4 60 uL, HIV load 317,000 copies).
Biopsy is performed, and the result is nonspecific.
The differential diagnosis is Kaposi's sarcoma vs bacillary angiomatosis.
Doxy sulfate 100 md/12 h was prescribed, and the skin lesions disappeared within a few days.
Treatment was initiated with EGV/colonist, FTC, ABC (Stribild®).
After 10 days of treatment, the patient came to the emergency department with acute▁malaise, high fever, oligoanuria and hypotension.
Laboratory tests showed progressive increase in leukocytes and procalcitonin, with normal urine sist and chest X-ray.
She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis with no evident focus.
PCR was performed on biopsy of a positive skin lesion for Bartonella henselae.
We propose the diagnosis of trinchera fever exacerbated by episodes of▁Reconstitution▁Reconstituted by AGA.
Gentamicin IV and corticosteroids were added at high doses.
She was discharged and continued to be followed up in the infectious diseases consultations.
▁Reconstitution syndrome should be suspected in patients with HIV infection who develop "paradoxical" reactivation of opportunistic infections that have been previously controlled with treatment after initiation of treatment.
The common pathogens described are M. tuberculosis, MAI, CMV, Cryptococcus,cystis and Herpes virus 8, but there are rarer cases associated with Bartonella such as ours.
