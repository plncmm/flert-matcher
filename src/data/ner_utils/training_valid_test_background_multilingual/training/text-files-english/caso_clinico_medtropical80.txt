An 83-year-old woman with a left hip prosthesis.
The patient was hospitalized on day 27 post-arthroplasty due to pain in the left hip and surgical wound dehiscence with serohematic secretion.
Antibiotics (meropenem/vancomycin) were initiated and three surgical cleanings were performed.
Dense white secretion was observed in the last cleaning at the neck and head of the prosthesis.
Samples were taken for culture.
Five days later Fusarium sp. was isolated.
amphotericin B deoxycholate was started for ten days, continued with oral voriconazole for four months with favorable evolution.
