» No family history of interest.

» Good social and independent support for basic activities of daily living.
Holocraneal radiotherapy of brain metastases was performed, which ended on November 3, 2016, being treated with descending corticoids for neurological symptoms during the following weeks.
First-line treatment with pembrolizumab was started on 11/2018.

Influenza vaccination
Physical examination upon arrival at triage showed blood pressure of 113/77 mm Hg, heart rate of 97 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 93 % with FiO2 of 35 %.
Temperature was 36.5 oC and Glasgow 15 points.
On physical examination, the patient showed a regular general condition, was conscious and oriented, although with moderate coughing and tachypnea of 37 breaths per minute.
On cardiac auscultation, the tone was rhythmic, without murmurs, while on pulmonary auscultation the abundant snoring and bilateral wheezing were very striking.
Abdominal examination showed no pathological findings, and no signs of edema or signs of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs.
Laboratory tests showed no alterations in red or white series.
Arterial gas remained at ph 7.48, with partial respiratory failure (PO2 53 mm Hg and pCO2 30 mm Hg).
It has no ionic changes, with normal renal and hepatic function.
A C-reactive protein of 13.2 mg/dl and a dementia rate of 975 ng/ml (normal value < 100) stood out.
A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates with predominance of bilateral interstitial involvement, as well as possible effusion and/or atelectasis in the right lung.
CT angiography did not reveal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, highlighting minimal bilateral pleural effusion and the appearance of ground-glass opacities in both lung bases, which were not present on October 2018.
▁Pneumococcal, Legionella and influenza PCR antigens were negative.
Diagnosis Given the findings at this time, the differential diagnosis was proposed between pneumonitis due to pembrolizumab grade 3 (severe symptoms, respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, life threatening pneumocixia and pneumonia).
Treatment Treatment Treatment Treatment was initiated with pembrolizumab and methylprednisolone was administered at a dose of 2-3 mg/kg/day.
Antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin and trimethoprim-methoprim-methoprim-methoprim-methoprim-methoprim-methoprim-mettoxazol, as well as supportive therapy, is prescribed.
The patients symptomatology was partially improved.
However, during the following days, the symptoms reappeared with increased cough with expectoration, with increasing oxygen requirements and worsening of the general condition.
Control HRCT, fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed.
Gram stain was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as positive serology for cytomegalovirus and Aspergillus, and positive RT-PCR for Mycobacterium jirovecii.
Voriconazole (400 mg loading dose every 12 hours and then 200 mg every 12 hours) and ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day) are administered.
Despite this, an unfavorable evolution persisted, and the patient died six days later.
