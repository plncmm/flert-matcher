Anamnesis A 53-year-old male patient who presented with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a subdural haematoma (SDH) at the level of the cerebral hozmy, encephalopathy as the only relevant past medical history.
She did not take any chronic medication.
The patient came to the emergency room due to asthenia, loss of 10 kilograms (Kg.)
in two months and severe oppressive abdominal pain at the epigastric level that gets worse with food
Due to these symptoms it was decided to enter internal medicine for study.
The tests carried out highlighted FA (Alkaline phosphatase): 516, GGT (Gamma gluttransferase determinations): 282, Caffeine distemper.) 19.9: 3800 with
Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with multiple lesions that were later confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) multiple liver lesions and a lesion larger than 10 cm.
A seizure was performed to rule out primary tumor pathology at this level, which was normal.
Biopsy with a black hole (GBA) of liver injury reports adenocarcinoma of probable pancreatobiliary origin with positive EMA,▁Cytokeratin 17 and 19 positive and other negative markers.
With this diagnosis was referred to Medical Ontario for evaluation.
The day prior to the Emergency Medical Consultation, she presented with confusion of 12 hours since her▁awakening.
The family reports that the patient does not seem to understand what is said and does not express words correctly either.
He was assessed by the oncologists who confirmed the confusional state and global aphasia, which led to the decision to admit the patient to the physician on sick leave for study.
Physical Education Scale (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group): 3.
Karnofsky Scale: 60.
Regular general condition
Disorientated to the three.
Little▁compressible language
He doesn't answer verbal orders.
Discrete shift of gaze to the left.
Difficult exploration of cranial nerves due to lack of cooperation.
Good mobility of upper and lower limbs.
The abdomen was blushing and depressible with hepatomegaly.
The rest of the examination showed no remarkable findings.
▁Complementary tests Analytical: Glucose: 336, FA: 346, PCR (Reactive Protein C): 26.04, Hb: 9.3, Leukocytes: 34330, Neutrophils: 29760.
Rest of normal determinations.
Serology: VDRL, IgG (immunoglobulin G) Borrelia burgdoferi, VHS (Virus Herpes: allergic urticaria), VZ (Virus Varicela Zoster)
Simple brain CT: No findings of acute brain pathology.
Brain MRI (MRI): No lesions of malignant appearance were observed.
Dural fistula of the right sigmoid sinus with▁retrograde flow and venous congestion of the temporo-parietal cortical vein and deep system.
CT scan (abdominal-pelvic chest): Compares with previous CT and shows larger liver lesions.
No pathological lesions were observed at other levels.
Lumbar puncture: Biochemistry: CSF (Cephalorrhachid Fluid) of clear and transparent appearance.
Leukocytes 22/field (77% PMN), Haematins 0, Glucose 92, Proteins 25.4
Autoimmunity: Antineuronal antibodies IFI (Indirect fluorescent antibody) (Anfiphysin, Ma2/Ta, Ri, Yo, Hu): Antimune.
Pathology: No tumor cells were found.
28 days
On the eighth day of treatment, the patient suffered a significant worsening and had spinal cord toxicity (Hb: 7.6g/dL).
Due to this worsening, it was decided to discontinue treatment and refer the patient to palliative care.
The patients evolution was torpid, with persistent global aphasia.
Initially, CT and MRI were performed to rule out brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement.
Lumbar puncture was performed with microbiological analysis, cytology and onconeuronal antibodies.
Herpes Sickle Cell Syndrome (HSV1) was suspended as it can produce an encephalitis with clinical manifestations in our patient due to the empirical treatment started after being negative, obtaining a compatible result.
On the fourth day of admission, she presented two tonic-clonic focal seizures with trismus, without sphincter relaxation.
Urgent CT was normal and Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed significant suffering in temporal and diencephalic areas.
Treatment with phenytoin and methylprednisolone was initiated, with progressive improvement of the confusional state and aphasia.
After 11 days of stay, the patient had a good expressive language and depressive disorder oriented by the three hospital discharge forms.
Three weeks after discharge, she visited outpatient clinics for EC15 per day. Chemotherapy (QMT) was initiated as monotherapy with Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, 28 days 1.
On the eighth day after the first cycle, the patient presented a great deterioration of the general condition: CACS-3, jaundice and abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium with indurated and painful hepatomegaly.
The analysis showed anemia (Hb: 7.6 g/dL) not present at discharge.
Due to the clinical deterioration and toxicity, it was decided to suspend chemotherapy and treat the patient symptomatically with the family.
The patient was referred to the Palliative Care Unit of the mental health unit.
The patient died at home two months later.
