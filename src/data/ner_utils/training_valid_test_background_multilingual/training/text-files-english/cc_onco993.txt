Her oncological history started in September 2014, when she was diagnosed with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma (hepatic), KRAS mutated (G12A).
The patient was enrolled in a double-blind randomized clinical trial FOLFOX + benzaizumab vs. FOLFOX + RO5520985.
The patient received 11 cycles (C) until April 2015 with partial response (PR) as the best response, and underwent right hepatectomy in June 2015.
In her first CT after surgery, a filling defect suggestive of thrombus in the right▁subclavian vein adjacent to the catheter was observed, as well as an increase in the number of micronodular lesions suggestive of bilateral metastases.
It was decided to start a second line with FOLFIRI without antiangiogenic or bolus 5-FU due to thrombosis associated with the catheter, as well as anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins.
After C3, once the patient achieved thrombosis control and good blood pressure control, she was added to the conflict accepted.
As the most remarkable toxicity, the patient had diarrhea G3 that required admission and as the best response stable disease (SS).
After C25, liver recurrence was observed and treatment was proposed within the RE-ARRANGE group.
The patient accepts and receives medication after consolidation, and is included in treatment arm C (regorafenib 160 mg/day 1 week on/1 week off, first cycle, second cycle 160 mg/day 3 weeks on/ 1 week).
Liver progression at first control CT in November 2016.
It was decided to re-treatment FOLFOX of the patient who received 3 cycles, two times admitted for pneumonia and low back pain in relation to metastatic lumbar bone involvement.
In March 2017, the patient received the first zoledronic acid and lumbar radiotherapy (22Gy on L2-L3 and a single dose of 8Gy on L4).
Traumatology corset was also prescribed.
In April 2017, the patient was admitted to the emergency department with a headache of 48 hours of evolution without response to third-step analgesia.
Cranial CT was performed without alterations and intravenous infusion was started.
with opioids at equianalgesic doses to which the patient had transdermally for pain control.
The patient progressively deteriorates consciousness with the onset of fever, as well as agitation, which required control.
Bladder catheterization was performed without pathological urine, hemocultives and urocultives were extracted, isolation and empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated.
Physical impairment In our first assessment in the ward, the patient was bedridden with poor general health.
Eupneic respiratory pattern at rest with oxygen in nasal glasses.
Skin paleness.
Poorly perfused.

No bilateral cutaneous-plantar reflex was observed.
Pepper in reactive intermediate position.
Brudzinski sign present.
Cervical stiffness.
No secretions.
▁Complementary tests CT of the lumbar spine (affecting goals 2017): loss of height of the bodies of L2-L5 that guided to small fractures-stretching due to vertebral insufficiency, being less likely.
On the contrary, the vertebral body of L4 had a greater height loss and global density loss with ill-defined internal areas of lytic appearance mutilated pattern, suggesting possible affectation goals.
» Urgent skull CT (April 2017): absence of intra- or extra-axial space occupying lesions, with no signs of bleeding or midline deviation.
» Analytical day 1st admission (April 2017): leukocytosis with left shift.
PCR 245 mg/l (Emergency Department 100 mg/l).
Hemoglobin 9.8g/dl.
The rest of the cases showed no changes of interest.
Diagnosis » Acute listergic meningitis.
» Sepsis and bacteremia due to Lis.
» Stage IV colon adenocarcinoma (hepatic, bone, lung).
Treatment by the Microbiology Service, communicates the growth of neurological lesions caused by Liscultives in lumbar puncture. After commenting on the case with Neurology, we refer to the patients clinical deterioration after the recent appearance.
It was decided to start antibiotic therapy directed with ampicillin and gentamicin, as well as adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone.
That same night, the patient began with focal seizures in the right hemibody, so he was prescribed midazolam for their control, and levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours was added to the treatment.
Despite this, the patient continued to have sub-intrating crises, so it was decided, given the hepatic dysfunction, to associate lacosamide 50 mg/12h, which, due to persistence of the same crane, was finally increased.
The patient continued to present progressive neurological deterioration and, after 8 days of admission, there was no improvement despite all measures taken, consensually with the family, which limited therapeutic effort.
The patient died without signs of suffering after 15 days of hospitalization.
