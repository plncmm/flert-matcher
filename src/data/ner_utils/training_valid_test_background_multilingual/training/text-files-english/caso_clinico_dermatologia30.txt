We report the case of a 51-year-old man with no relevant medical history who came to the emergency department with dry cough and dyspnea on moderate exertion for 7 days.
On physical examination, the patient was eupneic, afflicted, and pulmonary auscultation was normal.
The chest X-ray showed bilateral and peripheral pulmonary opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, which, in the epidemiological context in Spain of March 2020, was compatible with COVID-19.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for MRSA-CoV-2 coronavirus was positive.
Hydroxychloroquine treatment was initiated for 5 days and lopinavir/ritonavir for 10 days.
The patient remained in hospital for 15 days until her clinical improvement, with negative PCR for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Two days after discharge, the patient presented an erythematous maculopapular rash on the trunk with islets of healthy, slightly pruritic skin.
Addition of topical betamethasone 30mg and oral bilastin 20mg were prescribed, but at 24h the lesions extended to the cervical region, face and proximal region of the upper limbs, so the patient was treated with oral prednisone.
The clinical response was favorable and the lesions disappeared within a few days.
