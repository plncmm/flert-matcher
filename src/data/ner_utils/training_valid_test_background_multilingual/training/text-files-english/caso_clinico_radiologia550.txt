A 39-year-old polytraumatized patient with a 2-meter fall.
No remarkable history.
On physical examination, hypertension, tachycardia and saturation of 95%, diffuse peritoneal consolidation were observed.
Analytically, the patient showed a pattern of cytolysis, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and anemia.
Pancreatic laceration affecting more than 50% of the glandular thickness is associated with rupture of the main pancreatic duct, increasing the probability as more proximal to the head.
The presence of fluid between the splenic vein and the pancreas and peripancreatic fluid (serousal or ischemic) increases the suspicion.
In the emergency laparotomy, rupture of the splenic capsule and complete section of the pancreatic body were evidenced, with liponecrosis and inflammation of the peripancreatic fat and omentum.
Pancreatectomy was performed cardiorespiratory arrest with catheterization.
The patient was admitted with post-traumatic pancreatitis and organizing pancreatitis, treated with drainage and antibiotics.
