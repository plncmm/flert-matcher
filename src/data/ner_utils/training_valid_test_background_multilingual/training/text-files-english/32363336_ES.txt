A 45-year-old African-American woman, who was a second-hand quartic, 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant, came to the service on March 25, 2020 with counter vomiting.
The patient had a history of two vaginal deliveries at term and diet-controlled gestational diabetes (GDMA1).
Her body mass index (BMI) was 44.6 kg/m2.
Her medical history was only relevant with regard to obesity and advanced age of pregnancy.
Her only medication was daily prenatal vitamins.
The patient had not had any known contact with COVID-19 cases and had not traveled outside the United States during the last month.
Tachycardia was observed with a pulse of 120 l.p.m., fetal tachycardia with a basal fetal pulse of 170 l.p.m.
and an initial temperature of 37,5 °C.
She was admitted with iv hydration.
and prolonged monitoring.
2 hours after admission, the patient's temperature increased to 38.2 °C and the radiological tests revealed pulmonary edema and ground glass appearance.
Six hours after the initial consultation, the patient had severe hypertension in both limits, with a pressure of 183/114 mm Hg, pulse of 130 l.p.m., respiratory rate of 26 r.p.2O.m.
Taking into account the extreme blood pressure, a profile of preeclampsia was made which revealed proteinuria of 1+, thrombocytes of 274,000 per mcL-ALT as aminotransferase (AST-aminotransferase 24) of 32 IU/L.
A diagnosis of preeclampsia was determined and treatment with magnesium sulfate was initiated to prevent possible crises.
The patient's respiratory rate increased to 40▁rpm.
SpO2 decreased to 80% with nasal cannula therapy.
After an analysis with the departments of maternal-fetal medicine, obstetrics and general anaesthesia and cardiology, it was decided to remove the fetus in order to allow maternal resuscitation.
A cesarean section 7.5 hours after the initial consultation was performed on March 26, 2020.
On day 0 after the operation, maternal arterial gas/EB showed a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, pO2 of 117 mm Hg, HCO3 of 16 mEq/L and an base excess−
A follow-up chest X-ray revealed small bilateral peripheral opacities, with a differential diagnosis that included pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
Due to the suspicion of congestive heart failure, magnesium sulphate was withdrawn and furosemide IV was administered.
Cardiologists consulted for an echocardiogram, which showed a 40% reduction in the ejection fraction of LV with global hypokinesia; the patient was diagnosed with acute heart failure, with reduction in the excretory fraction.
Taking into account the clinical picture of fever, tachypnea and the results of the chest X-ray in the background of a pandemic, a GeneXpert PCR test for the RNA of COVID-19 was performed.
Additional laboratory tests revealed normal troponin levels (46 ng/mL), brain natriuretic peptide (114 pg/mL, normal <100 pg/mL), and procalcitonin (0.0%).
On day 4 after the operation, the chest X-ray showed worsening of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and, in spite of antibiotic therapy, SpO2 could not be maintained above 90%.
An electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific alterations of the T wave in an ECG, otherwise normal, with a QT/QTc of 354/465 ms (normal emboli).
Serum potassium was mEq/L (normal).
The patient's condition did not improve and treatment was started with 60 mg of methylprednisolone i.v.
every 3 hours and 400 mg hydroxychloroquine orally every 12 hours for 24 hours, followed by 400 mg orally daily.
That same evening, after the administration of the initial doses, it began to desaturate 86% with 6 L by nasal cannula.
Maternal arterial gas showed a pH of 7.07, pCO2 of 75 mm Hg, pO2 of 85 mm Hg, HCO3 of 2 mEq/L and base excess of 2 mmol/L.
A reservoir mask was placed at 15 L, which initially improved SpO2 to 90%, and on day 4 after surgery 100 mg of methylprednisolone IV was started.
per day.
On day 5 after surgery, the patient again desaturated 80%.
Since our institutional protocol on COVID-19 recommends avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation that could aerosolize viral particles, the patient was instilled under anesthesia, but no improvement was observed.
▁Pulse dropped to about 30 l.p.m.
and the patient had pulseless electrical activity (PSAE).
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and spontaneous circulation returned after five minutes of CPR.
After delivery, troponin value reached 0.930 ng/mL (normal < 0.4 ng/mL), with a brain natriuretic peptide of 323 pg/mL.
After CPR, treatment with IV▁norepinephrine was initiated, initially at 8 mcg/min, with a dose adjustment of up to 20 mcg/min.
A dose of 800 mg of tocilizumab was administered i.v., an interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6).
At the time of writing this article (2 April 2020), the patient is on day 7 postoperatively and is still intubated and with SpO in the intensive care unit, the infusion unit maintains 96% and the movement is maintained.
20 mcg/min▁norepinephrine, i.v. methylprednisolone.
100 mg daily and oral hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily.
The most relevant values of the analytical tests are troponin at 0.046 ng/mL and a marked increase in procalcitonin to 48.21 ng/mL.
