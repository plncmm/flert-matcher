We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with a personal history of HIV infection known category C-3 since January 2001 treated for chronic hepatitis C (HCV â‰¥ 2 celslip/mm3, basal viraemia of 85,000 copies/ji).
Currently she is on antiretroviral treatment with tenofovir, emtricitabine, darunavir and cobiscitat.
The patient came to Internal Medicine consultation due to progressive abdominal disfunction of two months of evolution, accompanied by intermittent fever and feeling of precocious plenishment.
Analytically, it highlights a glomerular sedimentation rate of 30 mm, creatinine of 1.17 mg/dL, total proteins of 6.4 g/dL, calcium corrected with albumin of 109 mg/dL transferase to 18 mg alkaline U/L protein, 142 U/trans.
Immunomicrobiology study showed CD4 217 cells/mm3 and undetectable plasma HIV RNA load.
The imaging tests performed are shown below: Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with hepatic, splenic and renal granulomatosis probably secondary to infection by P.jiroveci, an entity described in immunocompromised patients.
In patients with HIV infection, in the literature review, the infectious etiologies most frequently associated with the presence of hepatic granulomas are: M. tuberculosis histoplasmosis, MAC, Cryptococcus neoformans, cytomegaloci.
Empirical treatment with low doses of corticoids was initiated and the patient had a favorable biochemical response, clinical improvement with disappearance of the febricula and ceasing of the abdominal disk together with the existing granulomas.
