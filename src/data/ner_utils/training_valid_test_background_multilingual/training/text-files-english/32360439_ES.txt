A 73-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and carotid stenosis came to the emergency department with fever, respiratory distress and altered mental status.
The systematic anamnesis revealed dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting and decreased oral intake for two days, but did not report fever or chills at home.
She had had contact with a sick person in her house.
Vital signs at the first consultation were fever 38.3 °C, pulse tachycardia 102 l.p.m., hypoxemia with saturation of 85% in mask with 100% reservoir.
The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Due to the altered mental status, a cranial CAT scan was performed, which showed loss of differentiation between▁grey matter and white matter in the left parietal and occipital lobes, consistent with an acute infarction.
A chest CT scan showed diffuse ground glass opacities and peripheral patched alveolar opacities, characteristic of pneumonia or viral infection by COVID-19.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show results outside normal.
Blood tests showed leukocyte and▁lymphocytic colitis.
Urine analysis yielded results within normal limits.
C-reactive protein was high, with a value of 26 mg/dl (0–0.4 mg/dl).
No evidence of dementia was found during the hospital course.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 detected the presence of the virus.
Hemocultive and urocultive showed no growth.
A new cranial CAT scan showed evolution towards a large acute infarction in the left MCA area with hyperdense aspect of the left MCA vessels, consistent with an acute thrombus.
It was considered that the patient was not an adequate candidate for neurosurgical intervention or thrombolysis because of his condition.
The patient was treated with aspirin and other symptomatic measures.
The telemetry showed no abnormal cardiac rhythm.
Finally, the family decided to adopt measures and extubate the patient.
