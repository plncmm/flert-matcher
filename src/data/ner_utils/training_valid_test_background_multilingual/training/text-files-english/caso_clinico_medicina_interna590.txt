A 79-year-old patient came to the emergency room with a poor evolution of a spider bite that hit him after brimbling.
It begins with a lancet in the right cervical latero area and then pruritus together with a small maculo-papular single lesion progressing a few hours later to a progressively painless, local swelling, which increased swelling.
Twenty-four hours after the sting, a liveloid plaque appears in the sting area and blisters with content of erythematous zone of origin around.
It presents a good general condition, but with intense pain in the left supraclavicular area and significant fluctuating edema on which an erythematous plaque is attached to a painful adenopathy extending to the mobile breast of 6 cm, well-defined supraclavicular limits.
In the emergency department, due to the poor clinical outcome, an incision-counter-incision is performed on the most fluctuating area, without exteriorization of pus.
Leukocytosis with neutrophilia, normal rest.
Diagnosis: cutaneous loxoscelism.
The patient recognizes the spider when a picture is shown.
On the plant, it is treated with corticosteroids, antihistamines and prophylactic antibiotic due to the risk of overinfection, with very good clinical outcome.
It remains stable, with no evidence of systemic and apyretic compromise, with negative blood cultures and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.
