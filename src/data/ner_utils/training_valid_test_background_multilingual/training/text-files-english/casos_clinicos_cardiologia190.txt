PRESENT ANESTHETIC ANTENDATION, PREFERMEDUAL ENFERMEDADY AND EXPLOORTS 56-year-old male, without allergies, ex-smoker and paranoid schizophrenia treated in the past with ECT and
It is found by his unconscious brother; when ambulance arrives he presents blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg with O2 saturation of 65%, temperature of 34.8 °C.
On auscultation crackles and roncus in both lung fields.
An orotracheal intubation was performed and a catecox infusion was started (noradrenaline and tape).
Upon arrival to the emergency department, a cardiological evaluation by electrocardiogram (ECG) suggestive of inferolateral infarction was requested.
The ECG showed nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and rSR morphology of V2-V6 with last R crossed with the ST. Echocardioscopy with preserved left ventricular (LV) function and no segmental changes.
Analysis described in tests.
The chest X-ray is compatible with multilobar pneumonia.
Cardiology maintains an expectant attitude, and the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of respiratory infectious process.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES arrival ECG: nodal rhythm with QRS of 120 ms and morphology of rSR of V2-V6 with last R crossed with the ST. ECG after normal sinus rhythm correction: practice disappearance

ECOCARDIOSCOPIA: left ventricle with preserved function.
No segmental changes in▁contractility.
No aortic valve disease.
Minimum mitral insufficiency.
▁Right cavities with normal morphology and function.
No effusion or intracardiac masses.
▁CLINICAL EVOLUTION The intensivist team requests a new assessment of the patient due to doubts about the decision made by cardiology.
After reassessing the electrocardiograms, a new temperature of the patient was requested, which was undetectable at that time.
The patient is gradually warmed up with warming blankets and warm serum.
At 32°C, partial correction of waves is observed, which disappear completely at 36°C.
Making the diagnosis of Osborn waves by hypothermia and acidosis.
The patient finally died due to respiratory failure.
DIAGNOSIS Multilobar▁Pneumonia acquired in the community.
Acute respiratory failure
Hypothermia and acidosis, with Osborn waves on the electrocardiogram
Conserved left ventricular function, not structural heart disease.
Death.
