A 69-year-old male with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica,▁tubulointerstitial nephritis secondary to metamizole treatment, and diabetes secondary to prolonged corticosteroid treatment.
She was treated with prednisone 10 mg daily and insulin glargine.
He came to the emergency room for dizziness, weakness and instability of gait that caused accidental falls without sequelae, of 24 hours of evolution.
He had not experienced headache, vomiting, or any other symptom by devices.
On physical examination, the patient is in good general condition, being conscious and oriented, well hydrated and perfused, hemodynamically stable, with a fever of 38oC.
Neurological examination showed a Glasgow scale score of 15 out of 15 points, isochoric and reactive pupils with paralysis of the supraversion of the gaze, hemiparesis 3/5 in the upper and lower left plantar reflex with ataxia.
▁Complementary tests performed in the emergency room showed mild normocytic-normochromic anemiav(Hb 10.2) with normal leukocytes, leukocyte formula, platelets and coagulation; glucose 162 mg/dL, CRP 133 mmol/L.
ECG and chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
Pathologic mapping was requested.
A CT scan of the head showed unlimited hypodensity in the posterior arm of the internal capsule and posterior area of the right thalamus, compatible with an early malicious focus.
Non-contrast-enhanced skull CT: hypodense findings compatible with focal hemorrhagic certis or certis in the posterior arm of the right internal capsule - thalamus differential diagnosis - immunocompromised ischemic patient with neurological focality rule out: • Cerebrovascular disease
Given the age of our patient, a stroke should be ruled out.
The patient has diabetes secondary to steroid treatment as the only cardiovascular risk factor, with good glycemic control and there is no clinic of sudden onset.
Along with the subacute clinical presentation, a diagnosis of stroke can be ruled out.
• Primary CNS affection: primary or metastatic tumor.
The possibility of primary tumour disease (glioblastoma multiforme, lymphoma as the patient is immunocompromised) or metastasic (frequently primary pulmonary or melanoma) should not be forgotten.
The patient was not a smoker and did not present any skin lesions of interest, which in principle, along with the CT findings, leads us to reject the tumoral disease.
• Infectious disease: brain abscess.
In immunosuppressed patients it is important to cover uncommon pathogens in immunocompetent patients, and empirical antibiotic therapy directed to these microorganisms should be initiated.
The most common microorganisms to consider in immunosuppressed patients would be Toxo gondii, aeruginosa, Coccidioides, Coccidioides,ptococcus neoformans, Haemophilus influenzae, Liplasma Pseudomonas, Streptococcus pneumoniae or
E. Resident in Emergency Department, after the findings of cranial CT, empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated based on ampicillin, trimethoprim-prim-sentoxazole and meropenem, later on
▁Complementary tests with antigenemia for Cryptococcus neoformans and serology for Toxoplasma gondii were extended in the plant, both negative, in addition to echocardiography, which ruled out the presence of vegetations at valve level.
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with diffusion sequences, which showed poorly defined areas with epicenter in right base nuclei and although there was no digitalis-like involvement in the ventricular mid-diameter, and to a lesser extent, ipsilateral cerebral peduncle-line effect, aspect.
Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI: ill-defined area with digitaliform aspect with mass effect on the ventricular system with central ring enhancement, compatible with brain abscess in right basal nuclei with involvement of the axis.
This area showed diffusion restriction.
MRI with diffusion sequences showed central restriction of the lesion.
All these findings, evaluated as a whole, were diagnoses of abscess of infectious origin and perilesional edema.
Finally, the results of the hemocultives were obtained, which were positive for LisÃ©¥s syndromes, modifying the antibiotic treatment to ampicillin and gentamicin.
Clinically, the patient presented favorable neurological manifestations, with improvement of the left hemiparesis and normalization of the supraversion of the gaze.
Control blood cultures were performed one week later, being negative, with a decrease in acute phase reactants during the analytical evolution.
After 14 days of treatment, gentamicin was suspended, maintaining ampicillin until 6 weeks were completed.
A follow-up MRI was performed one month after the beginning of antibiotic therapy, showing a slight decrease in abscess size, persistent certis area and slight mass effect due to perilesional edema.
After completing 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin treatment, given the clinical improvement of the neurological deficit, it was decided to discharge the patient to home with linezolid-based antibiotic therapy appointment 600 mg/12 hours of internal medicine for 3 weeks.
Final diagnosis Abscess cerebral palsy localized at the level of right internal capsule and thalamus in immunosuppressed patient by prolonged treatment with corticosteroids.
