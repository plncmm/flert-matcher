Anamnesis A 29-year-old man, born in Senegal and living in Almeria for 7 years, with no subsequent return trips to his country of origin.
Agricultural journal.
She had a personal history of interest, toxic habits and regular treatment.
She was attended at the Internal Medicine Department complaining of respiratory distress for two months and sudden onset of oppression due to deep▁inspiration.
He also complained of unusual coughing, wheezing and occasionally unthermal dysthermic sensation.
During this time, she was prescribed several drugs for symptomatic relief on an outpatient basis (analgesic measures, mucolytic measures, antitussives with no inhaled drugs) and received treatment with levofloxacin 1 week, but without clinical improvement.
In fact, he complained of increased wheezing after inhalation of fluticasone/salmeterol.
He did not associate symptoms to other levels, except flatulence and constipation intermittently.
Physical condition Conservated general state, presenting normal pressure and afferent.
Adequate staining, hydration and perfusion.
No lymphadenopathy in accessible territories or evidence of mucocutaneous lesions.
Eupneic at rest, with good tolerance to decubitus and basal oxygen saturation of 97%.
Do not jugular engorgement.
Rhythmic cardiac tones at 80 bpm without murmurs or audible threads.
Pulmonary hypoventilation with some isolated wheezing.
The abdomen was blushing and depressible, with mild discomfort due to the deep fixation in the epigastrium, without masses or visceromegaly.
No edemas or signs of vascular pathology in the lower limbs.
Physical examination revealed no relevant findings.

Blood count: hemoglobin 16.6 g/dl, leukocytes 7490 mm3 (37% neutrophils, 21.90%▁eosinophils), total▁eosinophils 1640/mm3 (eight value was confirmed with a second analytical determination).
Basic coagulation with parameters within normal limits.
Urine output was normal.
Serology: HIV negative, hepatitis C: anti-HCV negative, hepatitis B: HBsAg, HBcAc and HBeAc positive.
Mantoux negative.
Basal arterial gas: pH 7.40, pO2 75 mmHg, pCO2 38 mmHg, satO2 96%, HCO3 25 mEq/l.
Spirometry with data of mild lower airway obstruction (FEV1: 70%, FEV1/FVC: 65%, FEF 25-75: 75% of the theoretical value) with sudden drop in the authenticity-volume curve
The chest X-ray showed small focal infiltrates, which were located more peripherally in the left hemithorax.
Differential diagnosis We present the case of a man with no previous history of bronchial hyperreactivity, who at 29 years of age debuts with respiratory distress, wheezing and constipation.
Pathologies that evolve with pulmonary infiltrates are grouped in the so-called "pulmonary▁eosinophils".
The entities that make up this group allowed to make the correct differential diagnosis.
Symptoms had started 2 months ago and did not document a previous history of allergies or taking drugs or other drugs, so the general population was initially diagnosed as secondary to a hypersensitivity reaction (first cause).
Since it came from a tropical region, the possibility of a lithiasis seemed more reasonable and consolidated as our first option.
In addition, the causes of idiopathic origin are usually a diagnosis by exclusion; and the rest of the pathologies (autoimmune diseases,▁neoplasms and other non-helminthic infections), were unlikely especially in the epidemiological clinical context.
Final diagnosis established in our initial clinical suspicion, 3 stool samples were requested for examination of▁parasites, and stercolaris was visualized in the third sample sent.
It was also confirmed by ELISA IgG Ac.
ethyloids with very positive result (index: 10, positive>1.1).
The final diagnosis was Löffler's syndrome secondary to stercolaris stercolaris parasitization caused by▁parasites.
The patients condition was managed with Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg for 2 days, with clinical improvement and subsequent disappearance of the medication.
She has not presented respiratory symptoms again.
