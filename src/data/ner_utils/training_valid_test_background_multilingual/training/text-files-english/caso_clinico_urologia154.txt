Anamnesis An 80-year-old male, former smoker, dyslipidemic, underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate in 2008 and two bladder TURs for in situ carcinoma in 2012.
Physical examination revealed fixed afferent, hemodynamically stable, and normal cardiorespiratory auscultation.
Abdominal examination was painful to deep mesogastrium prolapse.
▁Complementary tests • Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dl, without leukocytosis (leucocytes 4,500/mm3, 59% neutrophils).
Normal renal function with creatinine of 0.9 mg/dl and urea of 40 mg/dl.
Normal urinary sediment.
Urocultiva was negative.
• With the diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin, an outpatient ultrasound is requested, which shows aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta of 3.2 x 3.5 cm with mural thrombus and diffuse calcified atheromatosis.
• The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of aortic aneurysm under study, performing an abdominal CT angiography, which describes the presence of increased infrarenal periaortic density with inflammatory trabeculation of the adjacent fat and normal aortic caliber.
• With these findings, it was decided to perform a FNAB of the periaortic region with positive smear for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin.
Tuberculosis diagnosis secondary to intravesical BCG instillations.
Treatment Antituberculosis therapy with rifampicin 600 mg, etambu bag 1,200 mg and isoniazid 300 mg daily was instituted.
The patient was discharged after 15 days.
Thirty days after starting treatment, a new CT scan confirmed the improvement described in previous ultrasounds.
