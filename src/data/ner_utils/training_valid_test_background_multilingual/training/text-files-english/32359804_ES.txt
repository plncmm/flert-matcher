A 70-year-old woman treated with 7.5 mg prednisone as maintenance therapy for rheumatoid arthritis developed sudden bilateral weakness and tenderness in all four limbs, which led to total functional disability within 48 hours.
The patient reported no sphincter problems, dyspnea or dysphagia.
The first diagnosis was worsening of rheumatoid arthritis, but no improvement was seen after an increase in corticosteroid dose.
On admission to the neurology department on day 10 since the onset of symptoms (13 April), neurological examination showed tetraplegia, hypotonia, areflexia and positive bilateral Lasègue sign.
The cranial nerves were normal.
Temperature and pulmonary and cardiac auscultation were also normal.
On April 1, three days before the onset of symptoms, the patient had an episode of dry cough without dyspnea or fever, which resolved spontaneously within 48 hours.
Initial blood tests revealed no alterations except for▁lymphocytic colitis (520/ml; normal value: 1500–5000).
A nerve conduction study on day 10 revealed a clear reduction or absence of electrical potentials in sensory and motor nerves in the four limbs, without abnormalities, or very mild, in conduction latencies and in conduction velocities.
An electromyography found diffuse and abundant potential for atrial fibrillation at rest.
These results were consistent with acute axonal sensory-motor neuropathy (NASMA) of the Guillain-Secreta syndrome (GBS).
CSF analysis showed an increase in protein to 1 g per litre (normal value: 0.2–0.4) with normal leukocyte count.
A chest CT (day 10) showed ground glass opacities in the left lung.
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from oropharyngeal swabs (day 10) was positive, but negative in CSF.
The patient was treated with IV immunoglobulin.
(2 g/kg for 5 days) and a combination of hydroxychloroquine (600 mg per day) and beta (500 mg on the first day, then 250 mg per day).
No significant neurological improvement was observed after one week of treatment.
