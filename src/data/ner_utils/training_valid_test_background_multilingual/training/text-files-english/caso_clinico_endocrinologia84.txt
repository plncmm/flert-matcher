We present the case of a female patient at birth who initially consulted at 12 years in Pediatric Endocrinology of another center manifesting a male identity.
A study was initiated in the following years, which confirmed the presence of amenorrhea (with no response to primary estrogen progesia + morrisherma), with a 46XY karyotype and normal response to the catalog elevation syndrome with 2500 UI.
Subsequently, one sister and two cousins were identified among the relatives, also diagnosed as male pseudohermaphroditism.
The patient abandoned follow-up and at 24 years old the challenge was achieved by establishing a partnership with the objective of the study and reaffirming his masculine identity through sex reassignment surgery.
Physical examination at that time corresponded to a female phenotype with Tanner stage III-IV breasts, vulva and clitoris of normal size, with no palpable masses in the inguinal region and normal vagina.
Laboratory tests revealed LH 24.5 mIU/ml (mildly high), FSH 2.3 mIU/ml, Testosterone 8.8 nmol/L (mildly decreased), Estradiol 0.80 Î¼IU/ml
A genetic study was carried out to detect a single mutation of the androgen receptor gene (Cytosine switch to Guanine in exon 2) confirming the diagnosis of cryptococcal Sex Seizure Separate with bilateral RM
Currently, the patient is waiting for bilateral gonadectomy and awaiting to decide the best option for postgonadectomy treatment with the difficulty that entails having a gender identity clearly felt and expressed as male and intrinsic resistance.
