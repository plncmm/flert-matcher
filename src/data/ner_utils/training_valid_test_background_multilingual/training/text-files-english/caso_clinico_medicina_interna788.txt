We report the case of a 51-year-old man, who in 2001 was diagnosed with Variable Common Immunodeficiency. After several infectious complications, he began to receive immunoglobulin replacement therapy in 2005.
In the context of immunosuppression, disseminated chronic granulomatous disease with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, skin and spine (giant stenosis), which requires gastrointestinal resection develops.
▁Throughout the evolution, he developed right eye uveitis without clear response to▁cyclosporine A, but with partial response to prednisone at high doses that is chronically maintained (30 mg/day during the last 6 years).
In one of the reviews, the patient presented general▁malaise, headache that increased with Valsalva maneuvers, fever up to 39oC and photophobia of two weeks duration.
She was admitted for study, with laboratory tests without significant findings; a cranial CT was performed, which showed no alterations except for chronic synuopathy already known.
In CSF after lumbar puncture increased cellularity (76 cells) with 74% mononuclear, hyperproteinorrhachia, normal glucose and normal ADA.
Microbiological tests are normal (gram, aerobic culture, isolation and multiplex PCR) except positive Chinese ink, positive Cryptococcus neoformans antigen detection and microorganism growth in culture for culture of the same microorganism.
The clinical judgment is that of subacute meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans, so the patient begins antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine, up to 5 weeks of treatment.
After the clinical signs disappeared and the CSF biochemical normalization was normalized, together with microbiological negativization, oral fluconazole was started and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.
