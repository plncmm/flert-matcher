Eight year old boy attended the Ophthalmology Department complaining of vesicular lesions with pruriginous ulcers and atopic dermatitis that was not diagnosed with herpes zoster.
Because of this, the antiviral agent is substantiated due to its oral presentation, without showing improvement in six days. Then, a corticosteroid is removed due to the aforementioned bacterial infection and a skin lesion is prescribed to the patient.
Three weeks later, the patient was seen to have a mild decrease in pruritus, with stagnation of the previous lesions, maintaining a large scaling and erythematous keratosis with poorly defined base.
The culture was positive for Candida krusei, so previous therapies were withdrawn, recommending oral griseofulvin in two daily doses with disappearance of fat meals and suspending an improvement of cutaneous signs, producing 14 days.
