A 7-year-old patient with egg rejection since its introduction, and habomatous lesions, dysphonia and bronchospasm after ingestion, was diagnosed with an allergy to egg after having anaphylactoid reaction.
She had serum IgE and positive skin prick for OB/ egg, more marked for light than for yolk (clear IgE 32 kU/L, yema 10.90 kU/18VM, OV).
Progressively, specific IgE levels were increased to >100 kU/L for all lesions (clar vs. 10mm), with a skin prick test showing a greater reaction to 20x10 than to clear prick.
In recent months, diffuse abdominal discomfort has been observed about 10-30 minutes after ingestion of chicken meat that previously tolerated, with specific IgE >100 kU/L for chicken meat protein and 34.7 U/L for serum meat.
She had no contact with birds and did not refer symptoms with▁feathers despite being infected.
