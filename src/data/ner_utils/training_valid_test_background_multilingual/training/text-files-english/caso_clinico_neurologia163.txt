Anamnesis Female patient, 20 years old, without known drug allergies, smokes 10 cigarettes a day, with a history of allergic asthma, migraine with aura, recurrent urinary infections and chronic constipation.
e Hypoflexia is another center for the study and treatment of tetraparesis in the context of abdominal pain with hyponatremia (up to 105 mEq/l), bilirubinuria and choluria.
Physical examination Patient tachycardic (heart rate 120 bpm), febricular ( temperature 37 oC), peak flow 150 cc and cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination anodyne.
Neurological examination revealed peripheral facial paresis with Bell's sign, dysphagia, generalized areflexia except present alveolar reflexes, bilateral flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex, piloerection and significant sweating.
It also presents with muscle balance (right/left): 0/0, triceps 0/1, biceps 1/1, tibialis flexor 1/3, quadriceps 1/4, extensor triceps 34+/1⁄2, extensor triceps 1/1,
▁Complementary tests • Analytical admission.

Biochemistry: glucose 88 g/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, creatinine 0.50 mg/dl, sodium 134 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l.
Urine analysis: positive for leukocytes and nitrites.
Urocultive positive for Escherichia coli.
• Analytical control: VSG 114 mm; folate 7.88, coarse aggregate 1002.
• Blood count: no changes.
• Biochemistry: total proteins 6.9 mg/dl, GOT 70 IU/l, GPT 73IU/l, GGT 45IU/l, FA 128 IU/l.
Ionogram showed no abnormalities.
• Proteinogram: albumin 39.9%, alpha-1 globulin 6%, alpha-2 globulin 14%, beta globulin 15%, gamma globulin 25.1%.
• Autoimmunity study: negative.
• Urine toxicology: negative.
• Tumor markers: alpha-fetoprotein and Ag CA-125: negative.
• Serology: Treponema, HCV and HIV negative.
• 24-hour urine study: urine coproporphyrins 1,771 mg/24 h, total porphyrins urine 11,552 mg/24 h, urine porphobilinogen 13.9 mg/24 h, mutated uroporphyrins
• Analytical at discharge: - complete blood count: erythrocytes 3.63 M/mcl, hemoglobin 10.4 g/dl, hematocrit 31%, mean corpuscular volume 7.7 84.7 K/mcl, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 29 pg/ml, leukocytes 340
- Biochemistry: creatinine 0.36 mg/dl, cholesterol 224 mg/dl, triglycerides 212 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) > 60 ml/min.
- Ionogram: normal.
• Analytical CSF: glucose 74 mg/dl; leukocytes 40/mm3 (60% mononuclear), proteins 17 mg/dl.
• Electromyogram (EMG) (severe: findings suggesting generalized polyneuropathy, predominantly axonal.
• EMG (control): findings compatible with acute, very severe axonal neuropathy, which interests the four limbs but with greater involvement of the upper limbs.
Current exploration suggests acute motor axonal neuropathy.
• Somatosensory evoked potentials without signs of involvement of the posterior cord.
Diagnosis The patient was admitted from another center with suspected Guillain-syndrome, and started treatment with immunoglobulins with little clinical response.
Given the abdominal pain with the analytical abnormalities discussed, hypercellularity in CSF and EMG results, the study of the clinical picture is extended considering the possible differential diagnoses of Guillain-s Syndrome.
Autoimmunity studies and serology are negative, but in the presence of uroporphyrins in urine and with a compatible clinical picture, it is oriented as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).
Subsequently, the study of porphyrias was completed according to the recommendations of the referral center's Porphyria Unit, and finally a mutation compatible with PAI was determined, confirming the diagnosis.
Treatment Hemine and folic acid supplements ( folic acid and vitamin B12) are started, glucose, sodium and potassium levels are controlled, and medications that worsen the disease are prescribed to avoid them.
The management of heminthesized patient improved progressively.
Muscle balance at 53 days of admission was (right/left): neck flexor 3/3, neck extensor 3/3, deltoid 3/3, biceps 2/3 + extensor digitorum 3/3, tibialis 3/4 +
Given the good evolution of the patient to the specific treatment of the diagnosed disease, it was decided to transfer her to a rehabilitation center to continue the treatment non-compliance.
