Anamnesis A 62-year-old man, without known drug allergies, with a personal history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, ex-smoker of a daily package until 30 years of age, occasional drinker with a known inguinal symptom intervening
Treatment with lisinopril 10 mg and▁acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg every 24 hours.
She came to the emergency room for two episodes in the last 48 hours,▁watching television at home, and began to ask her wife in the face of an extra-child check-up.
Performing the same question every minute for 20 minutes and other questions about the activities they had performed on the same day, presenting confusion and extramarital episodes during approximately one hour.
After each answer, the patient felt understanding and▁assimilating the response apparently, after which he repeated the same question again within a few minutes.
Her wife, who initially thought she was joking, lost herself from the problem when the question persisted with the same intonation and impassiveness of her husband when she had asked her extranocuous answer.
The episode resolved in about one hour.
The patient did not remember anything about what had happened.
The next day a similar episode occurred, so they went to the emergency department.
At no time his companion reported a head injury, altered level of consciousness, neurological focality, symptoms suggestive of epilepsy or headache or other alterations.
Physical examination and neurological examination were normal.
The patient was normotensive, eupneic, afflicted, conscious, alert, and oriented towards the three.
Normal cranial nerves, strength, reflexes, sensitivity, and symmetrical conserved, cardiopulmonary auscultation normal without cardiac murmurs or carotids.
A Minimental Exam Test was performed in the Emergency Department, with a score of 30/30.
• Blood tests with complete blood count, coagulation including thrombophilia profile, biochemistry, iron profile, lipids, thyroid, markers of general autoimmunity and proteinogram; all results within normal limits
• Serology for neurotropic virus and negative.
• 24-hour electrocardiogram and echocardiography, and supraventricular extrasystoles were detected without other findings.
Normal electroencephalographic study.
• CT scan without showing vascular lesions or direct or indirect signs of acute ischemia, only hyperintensity of the intracranial vasculature suggestive of atheromatosis.
• chest MRI and angio-MRI and angio-MRI of the supra-aortic trunks and polygon in high ischemic diffusion-weighted images (2 days after the episode), showing a punctiform lesion in the anterior cortex (T1000).
In addition, there were several hyperintense lesions on T2 and T2 FLAIR of similar intensity and size to the previous one and suggestive of ischemic lesions in the periventricular white matter, semiovarian centers and others.
The hypocapnic regions showed no diffusion restriction or ischemic lesions.
Point-shaped lesion in the right cingular cortex with restriction in high diffusion values (B1000).
T2-hyperintense punctiform lesion in the right cingular cortex RALPF.
Diagnosis Transient global amnesia secondary to acute ischemic stroke in the right anterior cingulate cortex of probable atheromatous etiology.
Treatment with clopidogrel and atorvastatin at standard doses.
The patients evolution was uneventful.
In subsequent revisions after one month the patient does not report having had more episodes.
