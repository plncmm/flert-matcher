We report the case of a 74-year-old Caucasian woman, without CVRF, toxic habits or allergies, with only history of in situ bladder cancer operated for TURP, and in a study since 2012 due to tumor thickening.
She came to the emergency room for low back pain of weeks of difficult evolution despite opioids, without neurological symptoms.
On examination, sphincter contraction and control, as well as rectal sensitivity are preserved. At the global motor level 5/5 without loss of strength in both extremities, the overall sensitivity is kept intact cutaneous-ultendon flexors and the flexors.
Initially, the hemogram showed Hb 11.8 g/dl, without leukocytosis or platelet alteration; and in biochemistry highlighted C-reactive protein (CRP) 60.9 mg/l and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 523.
The patient was admitted for study and treatment of pain.
Differential diagnosis Among the differential diagnoses should be considered those diseases that present with inflammatory spinal pain, such as spondyloarthropathies and▁neoplasms (mainly bladder metastases).
As for the possible tumor origin, in the CT scans performed previously, no tumor was found at another level that could suggest a metastatic origin, as well as in situ bladder neoplasia was never confirmed.
Also, the fact that in metastases is common to find an increase in alkaline phosphatase and hypercalcemia and that in the laboratory tests of our patient these alterations did not appear, would rule out the diagnosis of tumor.
Another differential diagnosis would be pyogenic infections, whose incidence is higher than the tuberculous one, being Staphylococcus aureus the most frequent causal agent, and to a lesser extent, gram-negative bacilli.
On the other hand, brucellar spondylitis should be ruled out, since after sacroiliitis it is the most common osteoarticular location.
Also, despite being very rare, to evaluate the fungal etiology (Candida albicans), although this usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients undergoing broad-spectrum antibiotics and in extreme users of drugs administered parenterally.
Finally, multiple myeloma whose affectation in this patient is ruled out by the absence of a monoclonal component in the proteinogram (<1% of multiple non-producing myelomas).
The patient was admitted for study, finding CT findings compatible with subacute spondylodyscitis with involvement of the L2-L3 vertebral bodies, less likely to have metastatic disease
A bone scintigraphy showed hyperfixation at this level, with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showing findings consistent with osteomyelitis pre-discal L2-im osteogenic abscess (L2-im) of a small body.
Blood count with Hb 10.7g/dl, ESR 89 mm/h, without leukocytes or platelet alterations; coagulation revealed normal fibrinogen 518 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase GOT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin 75.9 mg/dl.
Urine analysis revealed intense pyuria (1219 leukocytes/mcl), with negative urine cultures.
The Mantoux test and Brucella serology were negative, as well as a chest X-ray with no findings to be highlighted.
A CT biopsy was required, whose bacterial cultures and different bacilloscopy results were negative, as well as those guided by Lowënstein culture medium.
Urological tomography (Uro-TC) showed findings of progression of lesions in the renal pelvis and right ureter, where inflammatory changes were observed associated with right renal cortex secondary to ureteral obstructive lesion at the meatus level.
In addition to clinical manifestations of C. trachomatis, acute phase reactants (ARF) increased, and symptoms related to root involvement (foramen olliteration at L3) were observed. Therefore, the empirical treatment was initiated
The initial evolution is favorable, with a decrease in the APR, but after the first week of treatment, these are interconnected and improved.
Bone biopsy result was obtained and reported as inflammatory, observing some Langhans cells.
With the suspicion of tuberculous origin, due to the lack of complete clinical response, and radicular compromise, the patient required compression and surgical release of lumbar roots with new sampling for microbiology.
After the intervention, tuberculous treatment with Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pirazinamide, and Endofloxacin was started.
The patients functionality was stabilized, ambulation and disappearance of the neuropatic pain, so he was discharged with empirical treatment tuberculous and antistaphylococcal.
The patient was reviewed in consultation and a result of Lowenstein, where M. tuberculosis had grown, confirming the diagnosis of suspected L2-L3 Spondylodyscitis due to M. tuberculosis.
Final diagnosis Spondylodiscitis L2-L3 by M. tuberculosis.
Urogenital tuberculosis.
