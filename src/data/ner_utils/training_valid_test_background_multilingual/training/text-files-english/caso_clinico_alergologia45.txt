A 12-month-old girl, a consanguineous father, presented with a 1-month history (macular, multiform), adding fever, asthenia, acute hepatotransient rash and hyper-reactamine phase, together with a progressive increase in serum transaminase.
BCG vaccinated three months earlier, having fever onset, presents inflammatory signs at the inoculation site.
HIV is ruled out and the study of PID with susceptibility to intracellular germs (combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous and IFN-gamma defects) is normal.
The extension study of BCG infection is negative, and it is recommended as BCGitis.
The rest of the infectious screening study was negative and the existence of‚ñÅlymphoproliferative process was ruled out.
Given the clinical and analytical persistence of systemic inflammatory involvement, it is suggested as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Corticosteroid treatment was initiated (methylprednisolone and daily oral prednisolone boluses), with partial improvement, so azathioprine was added and later anakinra.
Candidiasis mucocutaneous recurring during the following months.
refractory systemic symptoms and infections, clinical exoma is performed with study of genes associated with PID.
A homozygous mutation was identified in the AIRE gene, causing type I autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APECED).
Results: The most common form of onset of APECED syndrome is mucocutaneous candidiasis and hypoparathyroidism at school age.
However, as in this patient, cases with early onset inflammatory and/or autoimmune symptoms have been described as the initial manifestation.
