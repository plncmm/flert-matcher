An eight-year-old boy, born in Sierra Leona, who consulted the hospital Saint John of God in Sierra Leona for a tumor in the lower eyelid of the left eye with a time of evolution of about one month.
The father reported a history of contact with papaya leaves.
During the examination she presented a hard tumor occupying the two external thirds of the lower left eyelid, with ulcerations on the skin surface and mucosa of the eyelid.
There were also lymphadenopathies on both sides of the neck.
The rest of the examination did not present relevant data.
The impossibility of performing microbiological cultures in the terrain to administer a systemic and local antibiotic coverage as the first therapeutic option in the case of an infectious process.
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was administered orally, and topical tobramycin and tapevir.
But the most important symptom was the hard consistency of the tumor, along with regional lymph nodes that suggested a neoformative process.
Finally, the contact with papaya made us consider the possibility that it was a contact dermatitis to latex that exudes these fruits when green.
A skin biopsy was performed and sent to a referral hospital.
Anatomopathological study showed fibrin and polynuclear‚ñÅexudates in the superficial area of the ulcer and granulation tissue in the deep regions, where histiocytes with intranuclear giant inclusions of multinucleated cells were identified.
A focal nonspecific inflammatory reaction was observed in the deepest biopsy site.
SAP staining was negative.
The diagnosis was: ulcerated lesion with characteristics compatible with herpes virus infection, accompanied probably by bacterial superinfection.
At three weeks the lower eyelid tumor began to decrease in size, as well as induration, while ulcerations healed.
A month and a half, the repair was complete.
