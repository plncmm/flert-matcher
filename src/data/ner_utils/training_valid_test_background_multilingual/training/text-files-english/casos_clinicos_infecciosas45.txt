A 32-year-old man, without allergies, smokes 10 cigarettes a day and cannabis, occasional drinker.
He denied consuming other toxic substances.
Antecedents of personality disorder, with manic episodes and previous hospitalization in an acute psychiatric unit, treated with clonazepam, sertraline and quetiapine.
HIV infection of homosexual transmission, diagnosed in another center in 2007, due to a genital ulcer compatible with syphilitic primary chancro, with positive syphilis serology.
Intramuscular penicillin treatment was performed, confirming serological cure.
At diagnosis: basal CD4+ lymphocytes 920 cells/mm.
We did not know baseline viral load, but there were baseline resistances: L100I and R41K.
HLAB57 negative.
Antiretroviral therapy was not initiated because she had more than 500 CD4+ lymphocytes, regularly attending reviews, and was subsequently treated for a second episode of early latent syphilis.
In the mid 2014s, the patient attends our city and goes to consultation for evaluation.
At that time, the patient is asymptomatic with normal clinical examination.
Located stable partner residing in Madrid.
She did not have opportunistic infections at this time.
Their immunological status was reevaluated: viral load 58,079 copies/ml and CD4+ lymphocytes 502 cells/mm3 (18%).
Complete blood tests were performed with unaltered urinalysis; serology of hepatotropic virus (HCV negative, HBV and HAV immunized); IgG for toxoplasma negative and IgG for cytomegalovirus positive (compatible PR).
At this time, it is recommended to start antiretroviral treatment and a new study of resistance is requested, which does not show new mutations compared to the previous one.
Based on their immunological status, baseline resistance and possible drug interactions, mainly antipsychotic medicinal products, it is decided to initiate abacavir with lamivudine and dolutegravir for four weeks, with good tolerability and efficacy, with good virological response.
She had rectal bleeding and constipation that started about two weeks earlier. She had rectal bleeding and was referred to the gastroenterology service because of rectal discomfort, especially in the usual bowel movement.
No fever or general symptoms were associated, nor were any clinical data of severity.
On physical examination, she had a painful rectal examination, with no visible lesions; no genital ulcers or lymphadenopathy; no other findings to be highlighted, both locally and elsewhere.
The authors decided to perform a rectoscopy which showed severe ulcerative colitis positive, taking the anatomopathological findings of: "fragments of the mucosa of the large intestine with chronic inflammation and grantin tissue".
With the results of diagnostic tests, it is derived for treatment.
Differential diagnosis The patient consults for rectal symptoms.
Anorectal pathology is a relatively common entity in HIV patients, particularly in homosexual men who have anal sex with recurrent rectal ulcers (nonmalignant, infectious, traumatic or anal anal anal infection), the most common anal anorectal abscess findings are anal
Less frequently, these symptoms may not be associated with sexual practice and may be an expression of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
In this case, the rectoscopy showed inflammation of the rectal mucosa or authenticity, which given the patient's history (HIV infection and syphilis treatment in two), she was oriented towards a STI.
The germs that cause infectious meningitis are varied and may be involved in its etiology, both bacteria, viruses or protozoa.
Of these, the most frequent are: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus and Treponema▁reconciliadum.
Although they can occur asymptomatically, in most cases they give rise to a similar clinical presentation to that presented by the patient (severe anal pain, mainly when defecating, which is usually associated with general bleeding and tenmo.
However, the differential diagnosis includes CMV infection, which is found in the rectal biopsy and which can also cause rectal germ, although it is a rare cause.
Less probable in our case, other germs would be Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, Entamoeba histolytica (usually in gastrointestinal infections, not compatible with the patient's clinical history) and
Usual culture, isolation and detection of Clostridium toxin are generally sufficient for the diagnosis of these entities.
Therefore, the question raised is: is CMV really involved in the current condition or has it been a casual finding?
Removal orders patient history refer to anal intercourse without condoms with his partner living in Madrid.
At that time, it was decided not to start CMV treatment and the diagnostic study was extended in search of other germs more frequently involved, which in turn produce compatible clinical signs.
For this purpose, the following were requested: detection of genetic material by rectal Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of herpes, gonococcal and Chlamydia, as well as gonococcal culture and syphilis serology.
These tests are routinely indicated for the evaluation of all patients with infectious diseases and suspected STIs, since coinfection with several germs is described at the same time.
After the collection of samples, empirical treatment was initiated with a dose of ceftriaxone 1 gram intramuscular and oral contraceptives at a dose of 100 mg every 12 hours for 21 days, with complete disappearance of symptoms a few days.
The results of the tests requested showed a positive C. trachomatis PCR (performed by real-time PCR), with the rest of the negative studies.
Final diagnosis of the clinical context, microbiological findings and favorable response to treatment, the patient was finally diagnosed with: INFECCIOSE PROCTITIS BY CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS
