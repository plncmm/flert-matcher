Family history: father with prostate cancer.
Personal history: Allergy to inzitan, hysterectomy due to fibroids.
The patient began follow-up due to malignant melanoma in 2008 due to a pink and hyperkeratotic lesion located in the left supraglottic region. The result of the biopsy was clonal seborrheic keratosis.
The lesion became ulcerative, so in July 2013 a biopsy was again performed which was diagnostic of eccrine pororcarcinoma in the lumbar region.
The patient had to be operated on up to four occasions due to locoregional recurrences, last time in March 2015 with left inguinal consolidation with metastasis from carcinoma in 6/12 adenopathy.
Posterior PET/CT detected local recurrence and lymph node metastases at bilateral iliac, right inguinal and presacral levels.
It is considered unresectable by lymph node involvement and new lesions appear in the graft area.
The patient was referred to the outpatient clinic where chemotherapy was initiated.
Physical assessment At the time of diagnosis and assessment by the patient: Good general condition.
Aware, oriented, cooperative.
Maintained constants.
Cutaneous ulcers and▁exudates with the presence of lethalis in the left supraglottic region.
▁Complementary PET/CT studies were performed in April 2015 in which local recurrence and lymph node metastases were detected at bilateral iliac, right inguinal and presacral levels.
Reassessment TAC in August 2015 with partial response.
TAC in May 2016 with complete response.
Analytical.
Diagnosis The patient is diagnosed with eccrine porocarcinoma in 2013 after biopsy of lesions in the supraglottic region, receiving up to four surgical interventions for tumor removal.
Advanced disease was diagnosed by PET/CT in April 2015.
Treatment The patient underwent surgery with widening of margins on four occasions by the General Pathology Service, and in January 2015 the left inkine lift due to adeopathies by the Service.
On the originally implemented site, 6 taxotere cycles were administered.
In the outpatient follow-up and after the objective of the tumor progression, taxol was started in concomitance with radiotherapy, which had intention to treat.
When the lesions caused by radiodermitis were also severe due to complications caused by colitis, chemotherapy was suspended and antibiotic treatment (clindamycin and moxifloxacin) was administered together with local cures until remission of the infection.
The patients silence begins treatment in June 2015 with taxotere, ending 6 cycles in August 2015 with partial response.
In November 2015 a tumor progression in the skin was observed and received concomitant radiotherapy with taxol.
In February 2016, the patient presented skin lesions compatible with radiodermitis, which became complicated by colitis in April 2016.
It was decided to interrupt chemotherapy until the lesions resolved.
These lesions were treated on an outpatient basis with clindamycin, moxifloxacin and local cures in Day Hospital.
The patient experienced a good evolution of the dermal lesions in question of a week.
Currently, she is being followed up in outpatient clinics with a good evolution of dermal lesions.
The tumor is currently in complete response according to the latest TAC, and without lymph node disease.
