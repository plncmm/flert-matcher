A 49-year-old Afro-Caribbean man was a safer, non-smoker, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
On March 29, she was admitted with cough, fever and dyspnea for 5 days.
His chest X-ray showed left patchy consolidations, so treatment with IV antibiotics was started.
Heparin was not administered due to elevated Dynepo therapy; he was also started due to hypoxemia.
However, the patient continued to get worse and then was intubated.
She was admitted to our ICU due to a lack of beds on March 31, where HCV was administered due to worsening of acute kidney injury.
The respiratory problems improved and he was extubated on April 6, and withdrew steroid therapy, although he still needed intermittent renal support.
A renal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities, and an APTC showed a segmental pulmonary embolus, bilateral alveolar infiltrates, ground glass opacities and small areas of consolidation.
An echocardiogram on April 21 showed good biventricular activity without structural anomalies or valvular heart disease.
Despite routine physiotherapy, the patient showed persistent bilateral weakness in the lower limbs.
An evaluation of the lower limbs showed bilateral strength reduction (izq.
> der.)
difficulty in locomotion and coordination, although reflexes and sensitivity, as well as peripheral pulse, were intact.
Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities in the upper limbs.
A MRI showed a bilateral‚ñÅanomalous signal in the deep white matter that could indicate subcortical marginal zone infarctions.
On April 27, the patient was referred to a neurorehabilitation unit.
