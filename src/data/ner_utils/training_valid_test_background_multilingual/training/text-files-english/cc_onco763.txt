Anamnesis Initially, the patient tolerated the treatment adequately.
After three weeks, the patient began to present general▁malaise, pain in the perianal area, nausea and decreased appetite, so she began symptomatic treatment and food supplements.
Despite these measures, the patient has progressive weight loss, in addition to vomiting, oral intolerance and abundant fluid depositions of 50,4 Gyaque, so she is hospitalized with parenteral nutrition, complete hydroelectrolyte administration and suspension.
The patient evolved favorably, with a total of 15 days, with improvement of enteritis and reintroduction of oral diet with good tolerance.
Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted two days later, complaining of intense anorexia, with only food and fluid intake, asthenia, dysthermic sensation, cough with some phlegm without clear pain or pain.
Physical▁malaise.
▁Guided by three.
Sleep tendency.
Arterial hypertension 90/58 mm Hg.
Heart rate 117 bpm.
Respiratory rate: 15 bpm.
SatO2: 89 % in ambient air.
Afebril.
Acquirement: tachycardic, hypoventilation on the right base, with roncus ̄s.
Painless abdomen, with progressive noises.
You have swelling in your lower limbs up to your knees
Skin peeling in palms and soles
Additional tests Initially performed: » Blood and biochemical: haemoglobin (Hb) 10.4 g/dl, leukocytes 6400 cells/mm3, lymphocytes 200 cells/mm3, creatinine 0.48, sodium 128 mmol/l, calcium reactive protein 91 mmol/dl
» Chest X-ray: condensation was observed on the right base to the midfield.
Antibiotic treatment was established with levofloxacin and aztreonam, fluid therapy, and nutrition was initiated by nasogastric tube.
Over the days, the patient has intense asthenia,▁malaise, diarrheal stools persist (grade IV) and progresses from edema to upper limbs.
Linezolid was added to the treatment and a complete study was performed with chest computed tomography (CT): » Chest CT: findings compatible with necrotizing pneumonia in the right lower lobe, bilateral effusion of right predominance, with several pulmonary atelectasis.
With this, clindamycin is added to the treatment and diagnostic confirmation is performed, which is sent to microbiology: » Pleural fluid: negative culture.
Gram stain: moderate number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
The patient continues to present poor general condition, with asthenia, episodes of dyspnea and marked distress.
He has abundant diarrheic depositions, which worsen the situation of fragility, erythema and palmoplantar desquamation (grade IV), cheilitis, stomatitis (grade IV), and edema progress to
Additional tests are performed: » Clostridium difficile toxin and detection of nucleic acids in▁faeces: negative.
» Chest X-ray: worsening of pneumonia, with greater bilateral pleural effusion.
» Blood and biochemical: Hb 10.1 g/dl, leukocytes 8,000 cells/mm3, albumin 1.4 g/dl, proteins▁3.9 g/dl, CRP 124 mg/l.
After two weeks, the patient verbalizes desire to rest, does not want more suffering or more active treatment.
Perfusion of morphine was started for symptomatic control of dyspnea and costal pain secondary to pneumonia, so the patient remained silent.
Levofloxacin and aztreonam are maintained.
The patient presented clinical improvement after two days, which was somewhat more excited, with good night rest and no bowel movements in the last 24 hours.
Anasarca persists and continues with occasional dyspnea, glossitis, mucositis in the hard palate, and cheilitis.
In this situation, the plan is reconsidered and parenteral nutrition is restarted.
Dihydromidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency was suspected and genetic testing was requested.
A chest CT was repeated: » Chest CT: increased pleural effusion, with a higher component of pleural effusion in the right middle and upper lobes, with persistent findings consistent with necrotizing pneumonia.
A thoracic drainage tube was placed, leaving 470 ml of pleural fluid with a healed appearance, biochemical characteristics of transudate, and was removed after three days due to cessation of exit.
With days, the patient has progressive clinical improvement, decreased dyspnea, and limb edema.
New analytical control and genetic results: » Blood count and biochemical: Hb 8 g/dl, leukocytes 12,300 cells/mm3, lymphocytes 1,100 cells/mm3, Proteins 5.1 g/dl, CRP 97.8 mg/l
» Determination of DPD polymorphisms (dihydromidine dehydrogenase): there is a substitution mutation of a guanine nucleotide for adenine in the first nucleotide receptor associated with a
Diagnosis This is therefore a patient with several simultaneous and interrelated pathologies.
Given his middle stenosing rectal adenocarcinoma T3c cN1 cM0, neoadjuvant treatment with RT and capecitabine was initiated.
It presents severe toxicity to capecitabine secondary to a mutation in the dihydromidine dehydrogenase gene.
In this context, he develops severe malnutrition, which worsens his infectious complication: nosocomial necrotizing pneumonia.
Treatment In the second admission, malnutrition is initially treated with a nasogastric tube, but later is sustained by parenteral nutrition, with improvement.
Fluid therapy is administered for correction of electrolyte disturbances and antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, receiving levofloxacin and aztreonam (a total of 28 days), linezolid (7 days).
Pleural drainage tube was also placed with a 470 ml pleural fluid output.
A vs A, despite the fragility of the patients situation, and with the rejection of more maneuvers, the clinical course leads to an unexpected turn toward recovery, slow and progressive.
After four weeks of admission, nutritional parameters improved, reaching albumin of 3.2 g/dl and protein 6.6 g/dl, edema, oropharyngeal lesions and auscultation decreased.
An oral diet was initiated with good tolerance to it, and parenteral nutrition was removed at the fifth week of admission.
This improvement is seen in a long-stay hospital for convalescence and rehabilitation, where the patient remains for three weeks, with good functional recovery, and continues with her surgical intervention.
