Anamnesis A 43-year-old man with no relevant medical history and only history of prior surgical closure of a cystectomy in adolescence.
The patient reports that the first day he begins with a back pain in the context of overwork at work.
On day 11 prior lumbar pain was associated with vespertine febricula, so he decided to go to his primary care physician; after examination there is a single finding of lumbar pain with mechanical characteristics and lumbar lockage reported.
On day 16, the patient came to the emergency department because of worsening of the fever (now she has fever peaks of up to 39 oC) and also started with pain in the left hemiscrotum.
Physical examination revealed an axillary temperature of 38.6 oC and inflammation of the left epididymis and testis.
Blood tests: leukocytosis with neutrophilia and high C-reactive protein.
• Urinary sediment: normal.
• Ultrasound findings and focal abnormalities consistent with left orchiepidiitis with a hypoechoic area requiring follow-up until complete resolution.
• Blood and urine cultures requested.
Treatment and evolution The patient was diagnosed with left orchiepididymitis and treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg/12 hours was initiated, requesting outpatient consultation with the Urology Department.
On day 20, due to the persistence of the clinical picture, without symptomatic improvement, the patient comes back to the Emergency Department, where the results of previous cultures are consulted: • Hemocultiva melitensis positive for Bruc.
• Urocultive: negative.
With the suspicion of brucellosis, the patient is admitted to the Internal Medicine Department, where he/she stayed for 10 days: • Intravenous antibiotic treatment with gentamicin 240 mg/day + oral rifampicin 600 mg/day begins
• Anamnesis is extended: the only possible contact source is the customary cooking intake in a restaurant in Navarre (multi-site visitors made a month ago).
• Hemocultive on two new occasions: positive for Brucella melitensis.
• Serology for Brucella: positive.
• Rose Bengal: positive.
• New testicular ultrasound: progression of imaging findings in relation to left orchiepididymitis, compared with the previous study.
No images suggestive of abscess were observed.
• Sacroiliac magnetic resonance imaging: compatible findings with mild bilateral sacroiliitis.
• Transient echocardiography: normal.
Diagnosis Brucellosis with genital (orchiepididymitis) and bone involvement (mild bilateral sacroiliitis).
As intravenous antibiotic treatment with gentamicin is required during the first 15 days (adequate oral treatment with rifampicin and phenytoin for 2 months), the patient is referred to an intermediate care hospital to continue and complete intravenous therapy.
