Anamnesis A 76-year-old male patient, with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocoumarol, who came to the Urology Department because of a 6-month history of a nodule.
Physical Pathway is defined as a 1 cm thick nodule that▁surrounds a large portion of the nodule.
A rectal examination revealed a palpable prostate with a right lobe and an indurated left lobe.
Locoregional non palpable adenopathies.
Additional tests • Blood count: highlights leukocytosis of 12.81 thousand/mm3 with relative lymphocytosis of 31.2%.
• Blood biochemistry: glucose 147 mg/dl, creatinine 1.38 mg/dl.
• Systemic sclerosis and urine sediment: leukocytes 20-30/field.
Moderate bacteriuria.
• Urocultiva: > 100,000 CFU/ml Citrobacter koseri.
• B-HCG < 1.2 uIU/ml.
• Ankylosing agent
• Alpha-fetoprotein 3,41 ng/ml.
• Ankylosing agents specifically target audience (PSA): 26.48 ng/ml.
• CA 19.9 11.95 IU/ml.
• CA 15.3 7.5 U/ml.
• Penile ultrasound: a hypoechogenic nodule of 1 cm in diameter is observed in the right corpus▁cavernosum.
On the base of the penis, another 2 cm nodule is observed, located between the spongy body and the left corpus▁cavernosum, bilobulated and hypoechogenic.
Both lesions are highly vascularized.
• Tomography (CT) toraco-abdominal: alterations at the level of the pulmonary parenchyma, in relation to images of bullae and nodules with characteristics of uncovered bullae in the left lung.
Prostate increased in size (5 cm), with internal marks.
• Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): on the posterior face of the penis, two 2- and 3-cm nodules with a strong axis are identified, with a discrete intensity pattern in the initial phases of the body, mainly the left.
In the prostatic gland, on the right side of the peripheral region, at the base and middle zone level, a mass is identified that produces signal alteration, extends to the prostatic capsule on this seminal vesicle, also affecting this site.
Diagnosis Adenocarcinoma of prostate with synchronous penile metastases.
Treatment Bicalutamide was initiated in combination with leuprorelin acetate.
Sepsis is performed on a penile nodule biopsy.
Pathological examination revealed a vesicular biopsy with carcinoma.
Immunohistochemical study shows that the neoplasm is positive for vimentin, CD10, Cam-5.2 and racemase; it is negative for cytokeratins (CK7, PSATT20 and alkaline phosphatase)
The lesion suggests a renal origin due to clear cells (vimentin and CD 10 +); in addition, a prostatic urothelial tumor and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia due to racemase + marker should be ruled out.
CT does not show findings of lesions suggesting a primary tumor in the kidney.
Transurethral resection of the bladder was performed, as well as ureteral cytology and ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsies.
Intraoperatively, penile urethral▁rigidity was observed in relation to metastasis and certain priapism.
The patient presented a slow but favorable evolution with hematuria secondary to conservative measures.
Hormonal block (bicalutamide) was started during her stay.
Pathological Anatomy report showed prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason pattern 8 (3 + 5).
The urinary catheter is removed and the patient is discharged in good general condition, with spontaneous voiding of urine non-uric.
Subsequently, treatment with leuprorelin acetate was started.
Currently, there is a decrease in the pro-specific antigen, which is 1.17 ng/ml, and the previous antigen is 26.48 ng/ml.
