A 27-year-old male presented with fever and hemoptysis.
Two episodes of bilateral pneumonia in the last year stand out among the personal history, with clinical resolution and radiological improvement after conventional treatment, although with persistence of a left alveolar infiltrate in the control chest X-rays.
There are no risk factors for HIV or immunosuppression.
Work as a mechanics in contact with environments where welds, fats, acids, and other irritants are used.
Physical examination, laboratory tests and respiratory function tests were normal.
A chest X-ray revealed a bilateral alveolar infiltrate similar to the previous radiographs.
It was then decided to perform a thoracic computed tomography with high-resolution slices, consisting of fine slices of 1 mm of collimation at 10 mm intervals from the lung parenchyma, in▁inspiration, and with the patient in decubitus.
The study shows areas of alveolar opacification in left glass dispersed with dispersed side and overlap of an interlobular septal linear and intralobular septal thickening, known as "crazy-paving" pattern of extensive patchy lung.
Considering the radiological pattern at HRCT and exposure to inhaled toxic agents, the differential diagnosis is reduced to PAP and lipoid pneumonia.
A fibrobronchoscopy with LAB was then performed, which was inconclusive, and was completed with transbronchial biopsy. The ultrastructural study identified within the alveoli a positive alveolar▁polypophilic material with amorphous granular coherence PAS.
