He had a history of epilepsy with absence seizures treated properly; he did not smoke and his alcohol consumption was occasional.
Days before admission due to a 15-day clinical picture with severe abdominal pain "difficult to describe" (severe in mesogastric and epigastric regions), sleep disruption, hypoxia and decreased urinary output.
The patient associated the onset of symptoms with tap water intake at home.
The previous week she had consulted the emergency room on four occasions for the same reason.
At admission, the patient was in good general condition, hydrated, with blood pressure of 123/74 mm Hg, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 per minute, normal auscultation signs peritoneal neck temperature 37 or C.
The patient was hospitalized and underwent paraclinical evaluations with the following results: leukocytes: 8,120 per mm 3, neutrophils: 59.4 %, lymphocytes: 16.0 %,▁eosinophils: 18.6 %, hemoglobin: 17.4 g/dl normal; platelets: 27 % normal.
In the simple radiography, ultrasonography, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic▁retrograde cholangiopancreatography no abnormalities were observed.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a hiatal hernia with Schatzki ring and edematous and antral mucosa with some erosions.
Biopsy revealed chronic active gastritis, while endoscopy of the lower digestive tract revealed no abnormalities.
During hospitalization, the patient developed several panic attacks, agitation and anxiety, in addition to exacerbation of abdominal pain, requiring medical and pharmacological psychiatric management.
