Anamnesis We present the case of a patient, a 59-year-old man, who comes to the emergency department motivated by a language disorder.
The anamnesis reveals the absence of allergies to drug substances, medical problems and previous surgical interventions.
He did not refer to the usual pharmacological treatments.
Yes, we confirmed the presence of toxic habits, being an active smoker of about 40 cigarettes a day, and a drinker of about two glasses of whisky each day (according to his own words).
The current disease section shows a report of a 4-day course that begins with vomiting accompanied by diarrheal detachment, fever of 38.5 °C, along with generalized lumbar pain in the lower back.
On his own account, he begins treatment with analgesia and antipyretics, persisting fever thermometered,▁malaise, weakness and pains, these being intensified the day before his visit to the emergency room in the cervical area.
She describes episodes of language difficulties, after which she presents slow speech, mental retardation and weakness.
Physical examination revealed a persistent fever; normal skull, chest and abdomen.
Background.
Carotid stenosis normal.
Cardiorespiratory arrest revealed the presence of rhythmic and pure tones, without murmurs, and a normal pulmonary vesicular murmur.
Peripheral pulses were palpable at the extremities.
Neurological assessment: patient alert, brachycardic, partially oriented in space and time.
Isochoric and normoreactivepiles with a normal eye fundus.
Mixed dysphasia predominantly motor.
Unaffected cranial nerves.
Pronation of the right upper limb.
There are no changes at the sensory level.
Respected osteotendinous eyes
Cutaneous plantar flexor contracture was bilaterally observed.
The patient has no dysmetria and gait is normal.
▁Complementary tests • Analytical: only slight macrocytosis with a VCM of 102.3.
Complete blood count, biochemistry, hemostasis and venous gas within normal parameters.
• Lumbar puncture: presence of leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid 5/mm3, leukocytes 2/mm3, glucose 59 mg/dl, proteins 0.57 g/dl.
Viral load of CMV, EBV, HSV1 and HSV2 undetectable.
Negative culture.
• Awake electroencephalography: a slightly slowed base activity, over which point and slow wave paroxysms (delta) appear hypervoluted in the anterior temporal region of the left hemisphere focal.
• Chest X-ray: normal.
• Non-contrast-enhanced head CT: left temporal-occipital hyperdense linear image without edema, mass effect or midline shift.
• Angio-MRI of the skull: thrombosis of the left superficial cortical vein, the so-called Trolard vein, without any additional alteration.
Thrombosis of the Trolard vein.
Diagnosis Thrombosis of the superior anastomotic vein or Trolard.
Association of smoking and alcohol consumption as secondary diagnoses.
Treatment Treatment Treatment was initiated after admission with enoxaparin. A few days later, the patient was seen in the Hematology Department to start treatment with acenocoumarol, beta-blocker and valproic acid.
All of this with complete abstinence from tobacco and alcohol.
The patients condition improved, with no incidence until discharge on day 6.
In the following review at 3 months, the patient presents with iatrogenesis due to treatment with valproic acid in the form of weakness and mild gait, reason why the dose of valproic acid is reduced.
