Consultation note An 83-year-old male patient presented with fever of one day onset without apparent source.
Individual focus (anamnesis, physical examination, complementary tests) Personal history of: hypertension
Diabetes mellitus type II.
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
Benign prostatic hypertrophy
Renal polycystosis.
Gouty arthritis
Alzheimer's disease.
The patient lives at home with his wife and daughter.
It is dependent for some activities of daily living although it carries an active life, always comes to the health center accompanied by one of his daughters.
The patient comes to consultation with his daughter for a fever of a day of evolution of 38-39o.
cough with occasional white sputum
There is no other apparent focus on the anamnesis.
The only thing that the daughter tells us, the main caregiver, is that she finds him in the wild and occasional disorientation (for example, forgets that he has been through the night more supper with fever).
On physical examination there is nothing remarkable, and the patient is in good general condition, although we found him to be declining.
When considering a fragile patient, we started amoxicillin 750mg prophylactically.
The next day, we made a home warning requested by the family because the patient remains with fever.
Again, we did not find any focus.
The patient remains in good general condition, hemodynamically stable and with an anodyne examination.
We tranquilize the family and explain that the process will last several days with fever maintained, but that they should be aware of new symptoms that may appear and guide the diagnosis.
The patient follows us up to his home for mental illness.
We received a new demand at home one day later because the patient presented a great worsening.
The family tells us that the patient had woke up well, but that he was falling down and went to rest in his room, and later found him disoriented and with generalized▁rigidity.
On examination, the patient is disoriented in time and space, with a tendency to sleep and responds inconsistently to our questions.
Location (difficult due to lack of cooperation): Constants: TA 129/73, FC 117lpm, SatO2 90%, T 38.6o, glycemia 137.
Cardiopulmonary arrest: No murmurs, rhythmic.
MVC without added noises
Globulous abdomen, no masses, no pain, no peritonitis.
Lower limbs: no edema or signs of thrombosis.
Neurological: Reactive bilateral myosis.
Apparently, preserved oculomotor movements.
Left nasogenian groove bulging.
Rest of non-valuable cranial nerves.
Great gait instability
No loss of sensation.
Location of generalized strength.
K fix and Burdzinsky are not valued by voluntary defense, although there is apparent▁rigidity.
It was decided to send the patient to the hospital emergency department for further tests.
On arrival, among the tests performed stands out: analytical: CRP 0.9mg/dL, leukocytes 10330/μL with 67% neutrophils and 17.9% lymphocytes.
Platelets 186000/μL
Urine cyst with proteinuria
Chest radiography: bad technique.
Cardiothoracic index was within normal limits.
Free parenchyma without congestion or condensations.
Skull CT: prominence of sulci, fissures and cisterns with moderate dilation of the ventricular system in relation to corticosubcortical and/or non-identnil.
Adequate differentiation of▁grey-white matter.
Posterior fossa was uneventful.
No signs of intracranial bleeding.
No mass effect.
Study challenge without findings.
During his stay in the emergency room the patient presents neurological deterioration, showing progressively a loud sound,▁awakening only with painful stimuli.
It was decided to perform a lumbar puncture, obtaining a slightly turbid liquid whose biochemistry is: leukocytes 12/μL (100% mononuclear), glucose 77mg/dL, proteins 70.9mg/dL.
Gram stain is negative.
PCRs detected positive PCR for herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1).
Family and community approach Nuclear family structure.
The patient with his wife and one of his two daughters.
The family life cycle, considering the model of the WHO modified by De la Revilla, is classified as stage IV or &#8722;contraction (since the first child leaves the home until the last child does so).
The youngest daughter lives with her parents, being the primary caregiver of both, especially the father, who needs more attention to being more fragile than his wife.
Clinical judgement Meningoencephalitis due to HSV-1.
The differential diagnosis that we propose at the beginning of the process was an acute confusional syndrome.
Later, other infections of the central nervous system must be taken into account and, with the biochemical values of CSF, other viral, bacterial infections very early, aborted or tuberculous meningoencephalitis must be considered.
Other diagnoses would be autoimmune, metabolic or ischemic encephalitis.
Plan of action and evolution The patient was admitted to the hospital due to infectious diseases and started treatment with iv Avir (10mg/kg every 8 hours).
The patients evolution remains disoriented throughout the hospital stay, with inconsistent answers to the questions asked, but at first she starts eating▁crushed foods and is hemodynamically stable, without fever.
On the sixth day, the patient presented significant deterioration, not opening his eyes and only locating painful stimuli.
Oliguria with diuresis of 100cc in 12 hours despite intensive fluid therapy.
Urgent blood tests were performed, showing creatinine clearance in mg/dL.
It is possibly due to acute tubular necrosis caused by antiretroviral therapy, which is why treatment is readjusted and reduced to a daily dose.
Amoxicillin 875mg/clavulanate 125mg was added because aspiration could not be ruled out, since it started again with febricula, cough and increased secretions.
Progressive deterioration that finally requires sedation of the patient who died on the 11th day of admission.
