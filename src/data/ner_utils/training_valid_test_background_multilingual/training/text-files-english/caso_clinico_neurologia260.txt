Anamnesis A 27-year-old woman with a history of migraine without episodic aura.
He was admitted to the Neurology Service in May 2009 due to left periocular pain with decreased vision in the most external area of the temporal hemisphere associated with hypoesthesia of the left hemifield sensation.
Neurological examination was normal.
The patient was admitted performing the following tests: systematic normal blood, normal coagulation, biochemistry (including liver, kidney, nutritional profile, antinuclear antibodies and normal thyroid hormones paroxysmal hepatitis B virus, serology of hepatitis B virus and measles virus).
Lumbar puncture (cytobiochemistry, culture, negative serology, oligoclonal band), imaging tests (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] normal brain.
The clinical features of the patient were diagnosed with retrobulbar optic neuritis and treatment with megadoses of▁steroids was started, with which the patient improved, giving discharge.
Visual evoked potentials were performed on an outpatient basis, which showed mild involvement of the right eye (probable optic neuritis).
The patient was admitted again to the Neurology Service in November 2009 due to right retroocular pain that increased in lateroversion, with decreased visual acuity and subtle temporal hemifield borrosity in the same hemifield.
Pacemaker, nursing staff.
Good skin-mucosal coloration, overweight.
Head and neck: no jugular engorgement.
Carotids, symmetrical, without murmurs.
No lymphadenopathies.
Cardiac auscultation revealed fixed sounds.
Cholestasis of the lung: conserved mucus
Upper brain functions: conscious, oriented, no dysphasia.
CCPP: normal eye fundus, normoreactive and isochoric pupils, normal eye movements with pain in the left eye.
Decreased acuity afferent pupillary defect
Rest of conserved pairs.
Force 5/5 bilateral and symmetrical, normal tone.
Osteotendinous ligaments: +++/++++ global, bilateral flexor cutaneous-plantar reflex.
Feasibility: superficial and vibratory conserved.
Cerebellum: no dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia.
Normal gait, he performed tandem, negative Romberg.
No neck stiffness or meningeal signs▁Complementary tests • Blood count: normal.
• Coagulation: normal.
• Biochemistry including basic, renal, nutritional, hepatic profile and normal thyroid.
Proteinogram: normal.
Antistreptococcal antibodies, C-reactive protein, RF normal.
Antinuclear antibodies were negative.
• Vitamin B12 and folic acid: normal.
• Consultation to Ophthalmology: concentric alteration of the visual fields.
• Lumbar puncture: CSF opening pressure of 340 mm H2O.
▁Cytobiochemistry, serology and normal cultures.
Diagnosis Idiopathic intracranial hypertension syndrome without papilledema.
Treatment Acetazolamide is escalated to one tablet every 12 hours.
As well as active life and attempt to lose weight.
The patients evolution was stable since his admission, with a single increase of half a tablet of acetazolamide to control his intracranial hypertension.
In February 2010 she presented a visual acuity along with holocraneal oppressive headache, nausea and vomiting, so she was admitted and reinforced the patient's medication more than 260 mg with persistence of intracranial pressure measured up to 12 mm.
The Neurosurgery Department was consulted due to the persistence of symptoms in clinical session surgical intervention with a lumboperitoneal shunt.
As a result of this intervention the patient has improved substantially: has improved qualitatively and quantitatively the headache, follows outpatient reviews in Neurology and Ophthalmology, with visual acuity and visual fields.
