Candidiasis is a 14-month-old patient with recurrent eczematous lesions, diaper, and common cold, without other infectious conditions or abnormalities on examination.
The paternal aunt presented recurrent skin and respiratory infections in childhood, bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis; and in adulthood, skin abscesses and pneumonias, objectifying bronchiectasis and cystic lesions.
The father reported numerous respiratory infections in childhood and adulthood with the presence of bronchiectasis.
Appropriate hyperIgE syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance (ADH), chest X-ray, blood count, biochemistry, thyroid hormones, immunoglobulins, complement, and‚ñÅlymphocytic subpopulations were performed.
IgE was determined, rising from 411 kU/L (14 months) to 822 kU/L (23 months).
A genetic study was requested, finding a previously undescribed heterozygous mutation in the STAT3 gene, which was also found in father and paternal aunt.
Varicella vaccine was administered and hydration and topical corticoid therapy was indicated in eczematous lesions, oral antihistamines to relieve pruritus, and antibiotic therapy in overinfected lesions.
Our patient is a carrier of heterozygous mutation not previously described in STAT 3 gene, suggestive of pathogenic HyperIgE Syndrome with HAD, given the patient's clinical and family history.
