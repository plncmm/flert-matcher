This is a 44-year-old, religious woman, living in Paredes de Nava and born in Kenya, who consulted for a fever of up to 40oC with tiritone for 6 days.
Personal history of pancreatitis and rheumatoid arthritis
She had traveled to the country of birth to visit her family, from which she had returned four days ago, and where she had lived a month.
She had not received any anti-infectious prophylaxis.
The fever was not accompanied by cough, expectoration or chest pain, but diarrhea was present in two to three daily liquid stools.
Bleeding was present.
Physical examination: 113 bpm, temperature of 38.6oC, mild stenosis palpable, all other anodyne.
Analytical: hemoglobin 10 g/dL, leukocytes 2100/L and platelets 56000/L, (panocyte count higher than usual levels).
LDH 347 U/L, CRP 173 mg/L and procalcitonin 3.1 ng/mL.
Normal bilirubin.
Urine output and urine output: hemoglobin + urobilinogen ++.
Abdominal ultrasound: upper limit spleen normal.
Hemocultive, coprocultive, urocultive: negative.
Chest and abdominal X-rays were normal.
Empirical treatment with doxicicin and ceftriaxone was initiated in the emergency department.
On the other hand, when Malaria was suspected as the first option in the differential diagnosis, MalaroneÂ® (proguanil-Catalonia-Atovacuona) 250/100mg was initiated for additional tests three consecutive days.
No malformations were observed in the smear.
The diagnosis was made through a rapid diagnostic test that detects parasite antigen species-specific and common to all species.
The advantage is that it works as a pregnancy test and does not lack experience on the part of the person who uses it.
The evolution was favorable, with fever and anemia up to 7.7 g/dL hemoglobin, requiring transfusion of two units of insurance.
Upon asymptomatic discharge and in the review in the consultation it was found that it was not anemized again.
