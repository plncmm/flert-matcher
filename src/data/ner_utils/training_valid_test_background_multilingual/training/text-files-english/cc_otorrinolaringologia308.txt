A 58-year-old patient with a history of chronic middle ear malformations of the left ear over 30 years of poorly controlled evolution.
She presented with left otorrhea initially treated with topical antibiotic with poor outcome and grade III facial paralysis (HB scale).
A CT scan of the petrous bone showed an aggressive left mastoiditis with lysis of the cells in contact with the exit of the face, the wall of the adjacent jugular foramen and the middle of the posterior wall of the EAC.
The ENG showed peripheral facial nerve involvement with greater involvement of the mandibular ramus, active denervation and potential reinnervations.
Gentamicin culture was performed on the otorrhea in which S. aureus was isolated.
It was decided to perform a radical mastoidectomy for facial nerve compression.
Results: Cervical dissection was performed with subtotal petrosectomy, closure of the EAC and left Eustachian tube, as well as intravenous treatment with clindamycin.
The immediate postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged.
Grade III facial paralysis persisted after the intervention.
Two weeks later he was readmitted for a mastoid abscess as a result of surgical wound superinfection.
Cultures were taken from which Peptoniphilus harei was isolated.
The patient was treated with IV antibiotics with no further complications.
The patient is still under follow-up and rehabilitation of facial paralysis.
