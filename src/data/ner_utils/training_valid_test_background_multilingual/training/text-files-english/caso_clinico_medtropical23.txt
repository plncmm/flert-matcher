A 34-year-old male born in Spain, with no epidemiological history of visits to endemic areas for Chagas disease (American trisomiasis), idiopathic medullary bone marrow aspiration due to HBV hepatitis.
The patient shows poor response to treatment with frequent transfusion requirements and develops an acute cutaneous condition characterized by erythematous plaques of geographical edges and multiple hyperpigmented cervical▁papules on the back 21 days after transplantation.
A punch biopsy of the skin with suspected CMV infection was performed.
Histopathological examination of cutaneous biopsy revealed abundant intra- and extracellular vesicles (amates), which were initially interpreted as Leishmania or a related entity.
The spread of peripheral blood in fresh and bone marrow aspirate demonstrates the presence of abundant pyriform forms (triplesomes) characteristic of Trypanosoma cruzi.
Biopsy cylinder of bone marrow was performed which included a small fragment of ̄ muscle with bone marrow hypoplasia and intracellular parasite infestation by atopic dermatitis of T. Cruzi.
On day 35 post-transplantation the patient developed bleeding with▁exudates within the clinical picture of trypanosomiasis.
After serological confirmation and PCR techniques for T. cruzi infection, treatment with benidazole was initiated with progressive clinical improvement.
The patient was submitted to an exhaustive epidemiological study,▁concluding that the route of transmission of the infection should be one of the multiple transfusions received.
