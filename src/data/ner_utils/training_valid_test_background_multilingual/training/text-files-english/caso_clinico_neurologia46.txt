Anamnesis Male, 57 years old, smoker of 20 cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, moderate drinker and with a history of recurrent dental infections without other medical-surgical diseases of interest.
The patient presented a rapidly progressive, non-brupt, approximately 72 hours of evolution, consisting of increasingly intense weakness in the left upper limb, without pain or sensory symptoms.
The patient denied headache and/or neck pain.
About 20 days before, she reported having had a self-limiting episode in 48 hours of stabbing pain with pleuritic features in the left costal region that radiated to the ipsilateral shoulder and upper extremity root.
Since this episode she presented occasional cough with sputum smear and blood streams, accompanied by fever peaking at 38oC.
He also reported loss of consciousness about 8 kg in the last 4 months associated with asthenia, without hypoxia.
As a previous history of the constitutional syndrome, the patient had suffered a dental phlegmon with abundant suppuration, which was treated with amoxicillin and a fixed medication.
Located as general▁malaise: temperature 36oC, blood pressure 174/96 mmHg, heart rate 99m.
Basal O2 saturation 99%.
Capillary glycemia: 250 mg/dl.
Skin and mucous membranes: no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis or venipuncture.
Head and neck: no palpable lymph nodes.
Dental caries.
Chest, abdomen and extremities were normal.
Neurological involvement: normal cortical functions.
Normal cranial nerves.
Motor system: disproportionate left brachio-crural hemiparesis (0/5 ISS with global involvement of the distal and proximal muscles; 4+/5 IBD).
Symmetric REM, present in all four limbs, alive (+++/++++).
Bilateral flexor CPR.
▁Sensory system: normal.
Extrapyramidal and cerebellar functions were normal.
Gait and standing: mild paresis with IBD.
Meningeal signs: absent.
▁Complementary tests • Biochemistry: highlighted glucose 266 mg/dl, glycated hemoglobin 11.3% and elevation of acute phase reactants (RFA) as CRP (3.94 mg/dl); other parameters within the normal range.
• Complete blood count: 14,100/μl with neutrophils (74.9% neutrophils), macrocytes (CMV 102.6 leukocytes without anemia and normal platelet series).
• Coagulation: normal.
• Microbiological serum study: negative for HIV, syphilis, HCV and HBV.
Urine output and sediment were normal.
Pulmonary study: • Chest X-ray showing well-defined left lower lobe consolidation (LII).
• Thoracic computed tomography (CT) with VSD: lesion of 5.3 x 3.4 cm located in the left lung base, thick wall and air-fluid content suggestive of lung abscess.
Chest X-ray revealed a well-defined consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Chest computed tomography image with visualization of pulmonary abscess in LII.
• Spirometry: normal.
• Microbiological study of sputum and BAL by fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy: staining for bacteria, mycobacteria (BAAR) negative and negative.
Cultures (x2) negative.
• Transbronchial biopsy by fibrobronchoscopy: biopsy of segment 9 of the LII negative for malignancy, compatible with inflammatory process accuracies.
• CT-guided FNAC: puncture of the pulmonary mass in segment 9 of the LII with cytological study compatible with purulent material and positive bacterial culture for Streptococcus intermedius (streptococcus anginosus group member).
Cardiological study: • Baseline electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, mitral P wave, with normal P-R interval and QRS, with no changes in repolarization.
• Transthoracic echocardiogram: no evidence of endocarditis or structural heart disease.
Biventricular function was normal.
Brain study: • Cranial CT with VSD: two occupant lesions of the right frontal brain space are visualized (one cortical and another subcortical) with ring contrast uptake and perilesional edema.
• Brain MRI with contrast administration: subcortical lesion in the semioval center and right frontal cortical satellite lesion, with ring contrast uptake and perilesional vasogenic edema.
The subcortical lesion presents intense restriction in diffusion sequences.
Brain MRI.
A.
An axial T1w sequence view with contrast was observed, which showed a subcortical right frontal lesion with ring uptake and perilesional edema.
B.
A diffusion sequence is visualized, showing a marked restriction of the same lesion.
Diagnosis Pulmonary and cerebral pyogenic abscesses caused by Streptococcus intermedius with odontogenic focus.
Treatment Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with meropenem and metronidazole, replaced by ceftriaxone and metronidazole after obtaining the results of the antibiogram.
However, due to the appearance of a cutaneous rash associated with this condition, antibiotics were again modified to linezolid 600 mg/12 h (3 weeks of treatment) and moxifloxacin 400 mg/24 h (90 days of treatment).
During the first few days, corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone) was necessary to reduce cerebral vasogenic edema.
For adequate glycemic control, the patient required insulin therapy (insulin lispro and insulin glargine).
The patients evolution was very good, with complete resolution of the neurological focus after starting antibiotic and corticoid treatment.
Subsequent follow-up studies with brain MRI showed a progressive decrease in the size of brain abscesses until their disappearance, as well as cerebral vasogenic edema and lung abscess.
