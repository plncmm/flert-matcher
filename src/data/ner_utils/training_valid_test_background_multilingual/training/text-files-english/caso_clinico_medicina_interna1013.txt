In 2016, she presented recurrence with liver and pancreatic metastases. Chemotherapy with partial response was started again, which is currently maintained.
She was admitted in May 2017 for abdominal pain, anemia, mild leukocytosis and increased acute phase reactants.
Normal renal function and renal function.
No metabolic acidosis.
Abdominal CT scan at admission revealed a portomesenteric tumor thrombus, which led to the maintenance of anticoagulation. However, an episode of emphysema with analytical repercussions was ruled out.
Gastroscopy was performed with biopsy and the pathological diagnosis was negative for malignant cells.
Due to the torpid evolution, abdominal CT was repeated with the finding of peripherally distributed aerial images in the gastric remnant and persistence of thrombus.
Antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin- fixed paste and metronidazole, with tapering of the tape, without new episodes of authenticity.
Finally, given the underlying disease, the persistence of symptoms with intermittent abdominal pain and the absence of response to a new line chemotherapy, sedation was performed with exitus.
Emphysematous gastritis is an infection of the gastric wall by gas-producing germs.
The current incidence is increasing due to the association with immune deficiency syndromes.
The most common microorganisms are S.aureus, E.colilic, sepsis, S. pyogenginosa, P.aureus and Clostridium perfringes.
