A 42-year-old woman with end-stage chronic kidney disease, secondary to lupus nephropathy, and on peritoneal dialysis.
Establishment of four episodes of bacterial peritonitis and change of Tenckhoff catheter six months before admission due to catheter dysfunction.
The patient was admitted for abdominal pain (insidious onset, colic to non-epigastric tenderness and mild intensity) and the peritoneal fluid examination showed 3600 leukocytes/mm3 and 80% polymorphonuclear.
Antibiotics (ceftazidime, amikacin and vancomycin) were initiated and discharged with apparent improvement, but due to persistence of symptoms he was readmitted.
Three peritoneal fluid samples during hospitalization were positive for Fusarium spp.
Tenckhoff catheter was removed and amphotericin B deoxycholate was started for three days, followed by voriconazole.
The patient responded favorably and continued outpatient treatment with voriconazole (4mg/kg every 12 hours orally).
Microbiological isolation and initial identification were performed in the Microbiology Service of the Guillermo Almenara National Hospital.
Then, the strains were sent to the Clinical Laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine for Human and von Humboldt (International Unit of the STIs and ribanology Heredia) for molecular typing of the animal regions.
The three isolates were identified as species of Fusarium solani complex.
In vitro susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole, according to the methodology of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute - CLSI (M38-A), showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the three strains >16 Î¼g.
