A 61-year-old male, with no relevant medical or surgical history, complaining of fever for a week.
He was admitted to a referral hospital where bacteremia due to S. viridans group was observed, as well as a possible finding in the mitral valve, he was referred to our center for surgery for suspected infective endocarditis.
There, directed antibiotic treatment was initiated.
In our hospital he had a good general condition and was febrile.
Physical examination was normal.
After maintaining antibiotic treatment, the patient complained of daily fever without symptoms that would guide the origin.
Serial blood cultures were negative, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal and echocardiography was normal.
On the 5th day after surgery, a CT scan showed a 5.5 cm liver abscess in segment III of the left hepatic lobe and an "adjacent foreign body" that migrated to the distal wall of the gastric antrum and impacted the hepatic parenchyma
Gastroscopy showed only antral hyperemic mucosa.
General Surgery was contacted and the collection was drained.
The subsequent evolution of the patient was satisfactory with disappearance of the fever and progressive improvement of the general condition.
In surgical cultures, Streptococcus anginosus group, Prevotella intermedia and Veillonella eyelid grew and a fish bone was identified in the purulent material.
Streptococcus anginosus group is considered part of Streptococcus viridans group.
In general, within this group, S. anginosus has been associated with bacteremia and the other two species, S. constellatus and S. intermedius are associated with abscess production.
In liver abscesses secondary to gastrointestinal foreign body perforation, the nonspecific and variable symptoms of this entity, as well as the fact that patients do not usually remember the moment of ingestion, make the diagnosis of hepatic perforation even more complicated.
In our patient, the abscess originated by migration through the gastric wall of a fish bone.
