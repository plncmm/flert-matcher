Background, current disease and physical examination A 43-year-old patient, with no history of interest, who performs about 7 hours a week of intense sport (athletics and ventricular isolatedlia (aerobic ECG finding in Cardiology).
Physical examination was normal.
▁Complementary tests Echocardiography, chest X-ray and laboratory tests showed no abnormalities.
There were no signs or symptoms of ischemia on exercise testing, but the density of ventricular extrasystole increases slightly when maximal effort is made.
Clinical manifestations were defined as the onset of treatment with bisoprolol 5 mg daily and recorded on a control Holter monitoring the disappearance of EV but nocturnal atrioventricular block (AVB) with several▁pauses, the longest of 12 seconds.
The patient remains asymptomatic at all times and denies family history of conductive disorder, cardiomyopathy or sudden death.
Holter monitoring is interpreted as advanced AVB, bisoprolol is suspended and admission for study and monitoring is decided.
Nocturnal▁pauses in relation to AVB and/or sinus bradycardia of up to 7 seconds and very occasional VS were recorded.
It was found that the basal conduction is normal by electrophysiological study and sleep apnea is ruled out by polysomnography.
The poor clinical situation and the possibilities of curative treatment intensified the analgesia and the patient died.
Diagnosis In view of the absence of structural heart disease and relevant family history, he was diagnosed with AVB mediated by vagal hypertonia, and he was recommended to reduce his sports activity but he was denied.
The risk-benefit balance of the implant of a monolayer and a reject is explained.
During follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic, although Holter ECG showed that night breaks of up to 9 seconds duration persist.
