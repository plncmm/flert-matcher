· Chest X-ray: no evidence of pleural disease, acute or chronic parenchymal disease.
The results obtained were initiated antiretroviral therapy (HAV) with Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir (200mg/245mg; 1-0-0) associated with Raltegravir (400mg; 1-0-1).
In addition, Sulfamethoxazole/ Trimethoprim (800/160 mg) was prescribed prophylactic one tablet three days a week and Fluconazole (100 mg; 1-0-0) for one week.
Also, in view of the evidence of positive serology for syphilis, Penicillin G Benzathine 2.4 MU IM is prescribed once a week for a total of three doses.
At that time, the Tropical Medicine Unit was consulted, recommending that treatment with I verifies that the patient rejects polymedication.
In April, one month after starting HAART, the patient complained of a pruritic rash of 48 hours onset predominantly on the trunk.
Blood tests were performed in which all blood count and biochemical parameters were within normal ranges.
It has a CV of 1.7 Log and total CD4 count of 220/mm3 (10%).
Prophylaxis with Sulfamethoxazole/Trimetoprim is suspended and antihistamines are prescribed.
That same day he comes to a cardiology check-up who removes Ivabradine.
After two weeks of symptomatic treatment, skin lesions disappear within two weeks.
In May, the patient again consulted due to sudden appearance of▁papular, erythematous and pruritic lesions, with a tendency to converge, which disappear to the typing of the upper limbs and affect the lower limbs.
The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are respected and denies the use of new drugs, foods or substances at risk.
It is not in contact with domestic animals.
Methylprednisolone 40 mg IM was administered as a single dose and Hydroxycin, with complete disappearance of the lesions within 24 hours.
Eosinophils of 160/μL and persistent elevation of transaminase (ALT 76 IU/l, AST 59 IU/l) are highlighted in the urgent analysis extracted.
The urine study is normal and a chest X-ray is repeated, showing multiple pulmonary pseudonodules that were not visualized in the previous examination.
X-ray findings were extended with chest CT in which the presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of inflammatory versus infectious nature was confirmed.
At this time the patient is asymptomatic from the respiratory and gastrointestinal point of view.
It was decided to maintain the same ART, start Ivermectin and continue the study requesting the following tests.
Sputum study: · Ziehl-auramine staining: absence of AFB.
 Culture of mycobacteria;
Serology for Aspergillus, cryptococcal antigen, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paradioid, and Blastomyces: positive.
Long-standing illusory voiding is mandatory.
Nine PPD and PCR positive tuberculosis.
Serology of yloid IgG (ELISA): Positive.
Control chest X-ray at 10 days: bilateral pseudo-non-duplicated opacities that have decreased in number and size and are less clear compared to the previous study.
Ev Sepsis is a late diagnosis of HIV infection, ̄s disease that presents subacute diarrhea with subsequent appearance of a skin rash.
HIV infection: has a viral load of 5 log and a CD4+ re-counter of around 10%.
Therefore, it was decided to start the ART previously mentioned according to the indications of the GeSIDA consensus document and considering the rest of the patient's medication, so that it is a regimen without pharmacological interactions.
The viral load after one month of treatment is practically undetectable.
Subacute diarrhea: during follow-up in the clinic, she reported a slight transient improvement in stool consistency.
Among the possible causes of diarrhea in HIV patients, one should rule out that produced by bacteria, viruses and▁neoplasms.
For this reason a thorough serological and feces study is performed, discarding infection by the main pathogens.
In the case presented here, an endoscopic study could not be performed due to the patient's explicit refusal.
Cutaneous Rash: the most important in the etiological diagnosis of the rash is to rule out the possibility of opportunistic infection or drug reaction.
Opportunistic infection is ruled out after the results obtained in the study.
Likewise, it does not seem likely that this is a secondary process to the taking of drugs, since there is no temporal sequence between the introduction or removal of the same in the anamnesis.
In addition, a study of possible pharmacological interactions is performed, which are also rejected as a possible etiology.
Finally, it could be a cutaneous condition in the context of the reconstitution process, although it is true that the rash associated with this process usually does not present urticariform characteristics.
Lung nodules: upon their evidence, it is essential to rule out tumor pathology.
The patient described here has no constitutional symptoms or symptoms B.
There are no skin lesions or lymphadenopathies.
In addition, pulmonary images are in remission, so it seems logical to consider the infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Among the infectious causes, fungal, parasitic and those caused by mycobacteria stand out.
All of them with negative result in the study.
Thus, the presence of these involutive pseudonodules could be justified by the proinflammatory cascade that occurs in HIV patients when initiating HAART.
However, it is worth noting that the study looked at IgG positive frontyloides.
Epidermoidiasis is an endemic parasitosis in tropical or subtropical countries. Acute infection is generally asymptomatic and tends to become chronic.
In HIV patients, there is a risk of extraintestinal dissemination, resulting in hyperintention syndrome, especially when the CD4+ T lymphocyte count is less than 200 cells/mm3.
Disseminated forms are usually asymptomatic (sign of severity and poor prognosis) and when there are symptoms, they are usually sporadic and of long duration.
Diarrhea and malalignment, cough and pruritus are the most common.
All of them had intensity proportional to the number of seizures.
The most widely used method for diagnosis is identification of larvae in▁faeces, sputum and tissues, although occasionally the ̄s disease is not visualized.
Therefore, multiple serial studies in agar cultures or the separation of larvae by Baermann method are necessary, with higher profitability of both tests as often repeated and consecutively.
The presence of increased specific IgG antibodies is found in cases of dissemination and myeloidiasis with or without immunosuppression, lacking protective capacity for dissemination and are not indicators of severity.
However, its identification is useful for the diagnosis whose sensitivity can reach 97%.
Currently, the patient does not present clinical symptoms or alterations in complementary tests compatible with hyperinvolvement by cholinergic syndrome.
However, due to its epidemiological and medical history, and due to the clinical and serology compatible with colitis and sarcoidosis, it was decided to start treatment for the infection with Ivermectin, aiming at improvement.
