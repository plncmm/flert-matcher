Thyroid hormones in normal limits
▁Complementary tests: CT scan of the brain showed no significant findings.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Less pseudoaneurysms in the right lung parenchyma, most of them in LII, do not rule out neoplasia, with mediastinal lymph node involvement, especially at the level
Multiple focal liver lesions consistent with metastases.
Bronchoscopy with non-neoplastic appearance from the entrance of the left upper lobe, thickening of the carina.
Development: Clinical judgement: this is a patient with hyponatremia with low plasma osmorality and probable pulmonary neoplasia in the context of a probable SIADH.
Differential diagnosis: hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disturbance.
The differential diagnosis should take into account the high, normal or low osmorality.
In the latter, the true hyponatremias with the highest frequencies are found in clinical practice.
Hypothyroidism and SIADH are typical.
