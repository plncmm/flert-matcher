A 64-year-old ex-smoker with hypertension and severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was admitted to our emergency department with dry cough, dyspnea and hyperthermia of 4 days duration.
The clinical examination was normal except for a temperature of 37.3 oC.
Analytical tests showed an increase in fibrinogen, DíÆ and C-reactive protein.
The chest X-ray showed unilobular interstitial opacities in the right upper lobe.
Hydroxychloroquine was started and the patient was discharged 48 h later.
During outpatient follow-up, the patient presented chest X-ray with extensive pulmonary opacities,▁lymphocytic colitis and a significant increase in C-reactive protein, so she was readmitted and treated with a single dose of 600 mg of methylpred.
All markers of acute aortic inflammation showed improvement, but acute aortic regurgitation increased considerably to 4640μg/L, so that 7 days after admission (day 11 since the onset of symptoms), a descending pulmonary thrombus was performed to look for pulmonary edema.
Treatment with LMWH was initiated at an antithrombotic dose.
A follow-up CT angiography 17 days later revealed no aortic thrombi.
