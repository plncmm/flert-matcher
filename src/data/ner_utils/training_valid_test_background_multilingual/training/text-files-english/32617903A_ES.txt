Due to the lack of ICU beds, two days later the patient was admitted to our hospital (specialized care center).
Ventilation and ventilation were well established, and oxygen was removed for the following 48 hours, although the patient remained on continuous venovenous hemostasis (CVVH) for 36 hours.

Subsequently, she underwent a new oral anticoagulant.
During the following 7 days, despite routine physiotherapy, the patient could not fully recover, with weakness in the lower limbs.
Neurological examination of the lower limbs revealed hypertonia and decreased bilateral strength, although more pronounced on the left.

A cranial CAT scan showed no acute intracranial anomaly.
Persistent bilateral weakness and stiffness of the lower limbs led to a brain MRI, which revealed microangiopathy and infarctions in the parietal and occipital lobes as well as in the mesencephalous and basal‚ñÅganglia.
