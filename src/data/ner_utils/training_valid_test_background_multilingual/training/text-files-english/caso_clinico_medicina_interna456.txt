We report the case of a 36-year-old male who practiced sex with men (MSM), diagnosed with HIV infection in 2014 (lack of CD4 165).
Smoking and polydrug abuser (Csex and Slamsex).
He has been treated for multiple Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and maintains a 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART).
A lymph node biopsy was requested in 2017 consultations for polyopathies associated with B symptoms (CD4 27%, 562 cells/ mL, CD4/CD837 ratio and CV HIV 5.7 log).
Follow-up was lost and the patient came to the hospital after 8 months due to enlarged lymph nodes.
To distinguish between▁lymphoproliferative disorders, a lymph node biopsy and a CT/PET are performed (adenopathiae above and below the diaphragm).
The qualitative PCR of herpes virus in serum for VHHH-4 was positive (VHH-8 negative).
The final diagnosis was ganglionic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), whose main risk factors are low CD4 lymphocyte count and high viral load.
Pathologic confirmation ABC/3TC/DTG was restarted.
The patient continues to use drugs.
Six months after diagnosis (HIVVC<1.57 log), a constant increase in cervical lymphadenopathy was confirmed by CT.
The second lymph node biopsy confirms the diagnosis of▁lymphoproliferative process associated with HIV diffuse large cell lymphoma type with focal involvement of Kaposi's sarcoma (HHV 8 +).
R-CHOP treatment is started and the patient is currently in complete remission.
Lymph node KS is included in the differential diagnosis of adenopathy in a patient with HIV infection and poor virological control.
VHH8, herpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma (HVSK), produces pathology in tumor forms or▁lymphoproliferative syndromes.
The involvement of HIV and EBV infection in the pathogenesis of lymphomas has been widely demonstrated.
Diagnosis of lymphoma is essential in all HIV patients with EBV viremia (HVV-4), and it could anticipate the development of a future lymphoma.
