A 32-year-old man, otherwise healthy, presented acute binocular horizontal diplopia upon▁awakening, after 3 days with progressive respiratory symptoms.
He did not complain of pain with ocular movement or other neurological symptoms such as weakness, gait abnormalities, paresthesia or anosmia.
During the following week, her respiratory symptoms worsened, and she was hospitalized for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, after being tested positive for COVID-19.
The patient followed a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and steroid therapy; respiratory symptoms resolved over the next three weeks.
At the time of evaluation, the patient reported the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, 5 weeks after the onset of diplopia, with no change in double vision.
On examination, her best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye.
Intraocular pressure was normal and there was no afferent pupillary defect.
Examination of ocular motility revealed left esotropia of 35Δ in primary gaze, 4Δ in right eye and 60Δ in left eye.
The patient had a complete limitation of facial palsy consistent with a diagnosis of left ocular motor nerve palsy.
Examination of the optic nerve was irrelevant.
There was no hypoesthesia in the ophthalmic or maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve.
MRI revealed a hyperintense left external rectus muscle in T2.
The patient was indicated monocular occlusion for relief of diplopia and a follow-up visit was scheduled.
