The patient was a 4-month-old boy who came to the emergency department complaining of cutaneous dryness, heavy vomiting and intense decay that began 2 hours after ingestion of a gluten-free cereal papilla.
Complete resolution of the clinical picture with supportive measures was discharged 4 hours later Allergological study: Skin tests negative for corn, rice and prick-prick with the implicated papilla corn and specific IgE negative for rice
She was diagnosed with enterocolitis due to cereals.
No new episodes after removal of gluten-free cereals unless there is an episode of heavy vomiting after ingestion of dairy products with corn starch as a two-fold thickener.
At 9 months, an episode of similar characteristics to the one described 3 hours after ingestion of pur√© with gallo required new attention in the emergency department.
He had previously experienced small vomiting in relation to the intake of small quantities of other fish.
Skin tests and specific IgE to negative fish
During follow-up tolerance to gluten cereals and other foods introduced into food diversification were found, and IgE-mediated allergy to gluten-free cereals and fish was diagnosed.
We report a case of enterocolitis induced by gluten-free cereals and fish with proven tolerance to gluten-free cereals.
