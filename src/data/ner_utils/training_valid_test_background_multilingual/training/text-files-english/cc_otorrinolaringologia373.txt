A 27-year-old patient with no history of interest came to the emergency department with fever and headache for 8 days.
Initially the fever resolved with paracetamol but in the last two days it reached 40oC and began with drowsiness and disorientation when she decided to consult.
Cranial CT and MRI were requested, confirming occupation of all the paranasal sinuses on the left side.
The frontal sinus presented a deformity of the posterior wall, as well as a collection compatible with left frontal subdural empyema.
The maxillary sinus was in contact with root remnants of teeth 26 and 27 that were identified as a possible origin of the infectious process.
Empyema drainage was performed by left frontal craniotomy by neurosurgery, CENS with opening and washing of paranasal sinuses, and culture of surgical samples.
In a second time, extraction of root remains by maxillofacial surgeons was also performed.
The patient was hospitalized for 10 days on intravenous antibiotic treatment initially with Meropenem + Linezolid and after the result in multisensitive Parvimona Micra cultures he was dismissed to Metronidazole.
She was discharged without sequelae.
