Anamnesis A 75-year-old male with a history of Paget's disease, gastric ulcer, upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to duodenal perforation managed with conservative treatment about 5 months before the current episode and bilateral opaque hypoacusis, who came to extreme horizontal gaze
Since the first examination showed diplopia in the lateral gaze (after about 30 seconds of fixation) without other clinical and analytical alterations, the CT scan showed muscle check-ups and did not show any neurological abnormalities.
In the following 15 days the patient presented a progressive worsening of diplopia, also appearing in the Service dysarthria, gait instability, nystagmus and finally a clinical picture of disorientation and return to the Emergency Room.
During the worsening period, a cranial MRI was performed in a private center reported as normal.
The patient had no fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms.
As relevant data, the patient reported vomiting probably related to contact with an agricultural antifungal in the days prior to the onset of symptoms.
Physical examination Afebrile, blood pressure and heart rate were normal.
General attachment without relevant changes.
neurological impairment.
Higher functions: conscious, remains alert during the exploration, although it tends to drowsiness; attentive, collaborative memory, conservative semantic memory, with fluid, coherent language, well articulated, nomina, calculates, reasoning oriented to recent normal space.
Cranial pairs: II: FO without alterations; campimetry due to normal confrontation.
III-IV-VI: severe restriction for dextroversion and levoversion of conjugate gaze, greater in OI; mild restriction for the infraversion of conjugate gaze, greater in OI; moderate restriction for gaze.
Bilateral nystagmus, with rapid phase toward gaze direction.
He did not report diplopia.
V: sensory and motor without alterations.
VII: no facial paresis.
Conserved low cranial nerves.
Motor: strength 5/5 per muscle groups in the four limbs.
REM: present and symmetrical upper extremities (++/+++); bilateral patellar areflexia; present illustrative aquile reflexes (+/++++).
CPR: bilateral flexor.
Feasibility: thermoalgesic hypoesthesia in the lower limbs, normal rest.
Cerebellum: no dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia.
Gait: gait ataxia with increased base support and impossible tandem.
Extrapyramidal: mild postural action tremor.
▁Complementary tests • Analytical: blood count, biochemistry, coagulation, thyroid profile, lipid profile, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, PTH, autoimmunity, RF, complement and normal tumor markers.
• Lumbar puncture: normal outflow pressure and cytobiochemistry.
• Microbiology: negative serology for HIV, syphilis, Borrelia and Brucella.
Bacteria and mycobacteria were tested in negative CSF.
• ECG: no abnormalities.
• Cranial CT: chronic lacunar infarctions in the basal▁ganglia, with no other significant changes for age.
• Cranial MRI: in T2 and FLAIR sequences, signal hyperintensity is observed that affects the region of the mesencephalic tectum and that is available surrounding the periaqueductal gray matter.
There is also involvement of the nipple bodies of the hypothalamus, both fornix, as well as the medial region of both thalamus, on both sides of the III ventricle and focal areas of the mammalian body.
Diagnosis impression: this is a 75-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer and duodenal perforation that after agricultural poisoning, vomiting, presents with mild antifungal confusion, progressive anorexia and ataxia, anorexia.
Analytical and microbiological studies in blood and CSF showed no data of interest, while cranial MRI showed an injury pattern suggestive of thiamine-deficit encephalopathy.
Clinical judgement: Wernickes encephalopathy secondary to malabsorption at the duodenal level, triggered by intoxication by antifungals.
Treatment Thiamin was started at a dose of 500 mg intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days, 500 mg intravenously daily for the following 4 days, and then 300 mg daily orally.
After initiating treatment, the patient progressively improved, leaving a mild lack of consciousness, bilateral nystagmus and difficulty walking on a tandem basis upon discharge.
