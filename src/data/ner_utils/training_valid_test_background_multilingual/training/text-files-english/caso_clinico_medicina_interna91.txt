Current history Patient who comes to the emergency department of our center to suddenly present severe muscle pain in the right arm of 4 hours of evolution without apparent triggers.
The accrual of great concern and anxiety due to the possible cardiological origin of the symptoms.
He did not report dyspnea, ortopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She had no previous presyncopal episodes or syncopes or other accompanying respiratory symptoms.
Although he comments that the pain has different characteristics, the patient had been previously studied by Cardiology in 2006 due to an episode of chest pain with characteristics apparently related to excessive alcohol consumption.
The study showed high levels of CPK, with an echocardiogram and a stress test without abnormalities, ruling out a cardiological origin of both symptoms and laboratory abnormalities (not accompanied by report of the tests performed).
Based on these data, ECG (no signs of acute ischemia and basic laboratory tests were performed in the emergency department, highlighting normal ALT/GPT levels of 07.970 IU/L (n: 07.67/0-41) and normal liver function tests.
Inflammatory parameters (SGA and CRP) within normal limits, with normal renal function without electrolyte disturbance, Hb 15.4 g/dl, Platelets 263 10E9/L, Leukocytes 6.2
Normal coagulation.
Abnormal and unaltered sedation.
These results are attributed to pain a probable musculoskeletal origin and the patient is referred to Internal Medicine consultation to see evolution and complete study of mild analytical alteration.
In internal medicine consultation, the patient was re-history that described from childhood exercise intolerance manifested as asthenia and generalized myalgias, both proximal and distal, without arthritis or new skin lesions.
Anamnesis with an appliance has not presented fever or cramps.
No loss of muscle mass.
No fasciculations or sensory symptoms.
It has a relatively normal life, with the limitation described for the practice of some sport and that condition it to carry a relatively sedentary life.
Don't cough or phlegm.
No recent infectious episodes.
No abdominal pain.
Intestinal habit was conserved with 1 deposition per day without pathological products.
The patient provides previous laboratory tests, which showed significant variations in CPK levels in recent years, apparently coincident with the use of statins and moderate concomitant alcohol consumption.
In addition, the patient presented chronic hypertransaminasemia and no episodes of jaundice or other signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, which were thought to be possible non-alcoholic viral steatohepatitis with serology.
Previously, different tests had been performed (whole body MRI, electrophysiological study, liver biopsy) without finding alterations.
Location T.A.
: 110/70 mmHg.
HR: 79/minute.
Afebril.
Sat.02: 96%.
BMI: 28 kg/m2.
Good general condition.
Good coloration of skin and mucous membranes
Pharynge: normal.
Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormalities.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed normal.
Abdomen: blade, depressible, without pain or enlargement.
Extremities: peripheral pulses, no edema.
No pain at palpation.
No signs of arthritis.
Neurological alteration anodyne.
Or else, discuss neurological symptoms after reviewing the available tests and re-history of the patient, direct the studies to a clinical picture of exercise intolerance in the form of asthenia and myalgia accompanied by mild hypertransient signs.
Also, in the absence of compatible skin lesions and characteristic muscle weakness, we reasonably ruled out the diagnosis of polymyositis and/or dermatomyositis.
The following diagnostic approach was used: 1. In view of the possibility of an adverse drug reaction, we reviewed and removed the drugs potentially implicated (Gemfibrocil/Benzodiazepines/Escitalop).
2. Serology against CMV, Epstein barr, Herpes virus and HIV were negative and a study of hypertransaminasemia was completed using serology for HAV, B and SMA A.
3. We completed a Doppler ultrasound study of diffuse hepatic steatosis with a perivesicular preservation area, without evidence of solid focal lesions.
Multiple vesicular▁polyps (probably cholesterol) with a normal caliber bile duct.
Once the possible acquired etiologies of CPK elevation have been ruled out, the case is oriented towards a possible hereditary myopathy.
Therefore, we delve into the family history and characteristics of the patient's symptoms.
None of his family environment had similar symptoms and the patient reported early fatigue and myalgia with improvement in exercise tolerance after several minutes from the beginning.
A review of the literature was conducted and three large groups were found within the hereditary myopathies: · Glycogenosis, · Alterations in lipid metabolism · Mitochondrial diseases.
In order of frequency, encompassing the three groups, three entities stand out: · Carnitine palmitoyl transferase II (CPT II), · myophosphorylase deficiency (McA deficiency) III (FD).
According to the diagnostic algorithm--- the elevation of CPK levels together with severe exercise intolerance (in the form of asthenia and myalgia) from the beginning of the disease but significantly improves after 5-10 minutes,
Therefore, we performed an ischemia test which confirmed a slight elevation of lactic acid compatible with difficulty in glycogen metabolism.
A muscle biopsy showed the presence of skeletal muscle tissue with structural preservation and a relative increase in the amount of glycogen in the muscle fibers.
In the▁immunohistochemical study performed, the absence of historeaction against myophosphorylase stood out, with normalcy of the other patterns of historrhile, confirming the existence of a myophosphorylase deficiency corresponding to myopathy.
