Anamnesis A 70-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma treated with FOLFOX-cetuximab for 3 months.
No known diabetes or history of interest.
He was admitted for treatment of obstructive atelectasis of metastatic origin and had been receiving oral corticosteroids since admission to control dyspnea.
Physical examination during the patient's stay revealed a bullous eruption with erythematous halo on the left lower limb, without other skin lesions.
Quickly, the lesion progressed to a necrotic plaque 4 cm in diameter, very painful, with irregular borders, with a large homogeneous purple halo.
No clear skin entry door was found.
It was only possible to relate it to a urine collection bag that the patient had carried in that limb near the initial skin lesion.
No systemic symptoms were observed.
‚ñÅComplementary laboratory tests showed no significant alterations.
A deep biopsy of the ulcer was performed, revealing foci of ischemic necrosis and numerous fungal emboli affecting the vascular walls and underlying tissue.
It was a non-taking hyphae with hyphae, subsequently identified as Rhizopus oryzae.
Diagnosis Having ruled out distant involvement, the diagnosis of primary cutaneous mucormycosis was established.
Treatment and evolution Treatment was initiated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, with favorable evolution until hospital discharge, and subsequently oral Posaconazole was prescribed until a month later.
It was also necessary to perform surgical debridement of the lesion with skin graft contribution.
