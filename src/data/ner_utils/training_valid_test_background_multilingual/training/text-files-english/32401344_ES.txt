A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department of the Mantua municipal hospital in November 2011 with severe cutaneous and spontaneous muscle bleeding.
She had no history of bleeding.
Blood tests revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL) with normal leukocytes and thrombocytes and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (quotient 2.97, normal range 0.82 to 1.18), with normal prothrombin time.
A study of mixtures did not achieve a correction of activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor that was correctly identified as factor VIII-targeted (BtheUIII < 1%), inhibitor value 25 units.
An idiopathic acquired AH was diagnosed.
The patient was successfully treated with recombinant activated factor VII iv.
(90 Î¼g/kg every 3 hours until bleeding was resolved) and oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide (1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, then progressive decrease), with complete remission on day +21.
After a period of 9 years in good health, with normal coagulation tests performed every 6 months, the patient was admitted again to the municipal hospital of Mantua in March 2020 due to fever, asthenia (38.7 days).
The diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) was confirmed by RT-PCR of nasal swabs.
A chest CT scan showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia.
Due to the concomitant presence of extensive hematoma in the trunk, aPTT analysis was performed, which revealed a prolonged time (2.87).
Again, a diagnosis of AHA was established (FVIII < 1%, inhibitor value 19 BU) and the patient was treated with the same anti-arrhagic regimen, with complete remission on day +20.
In addition, the patient received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg twice daily) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation plus V-cotherapy due to severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SA2).
