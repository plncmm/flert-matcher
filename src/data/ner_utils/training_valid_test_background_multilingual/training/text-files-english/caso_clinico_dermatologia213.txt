Anamnesis 44-year-old male with chronic enolic habit (40g/ day) and history of HIV-1 infection CDC group A2 diagnosed in 1993 with newly diagnosed hepatitis C virus load = 846 μm
Physical examination revealed the presence of serous plaques measuring 0.51cm in the dorsum of the hands and both foreheads, as well as erosions and crusts superficial blisters.
The patient had an isolated lesion of characteristic simila- res in the▁ears.
Residual atrophic scars with hypopigmentation in the periphery and some millium cysts were also observed.
In the face, periocular level and in both cheeks showed melasma-like pigmentation and slight malar hypertrichosis.
▁Complementary binding • Biochemistry: GPT 80 (5-45 U/l), GOT 49 (5-37 U/l), GGT 117 (8-61 U/l).
Glucose, cholesterol, renal function and unchanged irbesartan.
• Blood count: Hb 17.2 g/dl, hematocrit 49.1-49.7%).
• Ferritine 440 (30-400ng/ml), Transferrin 230 (200360mg/dl), transferrin saturation 53 (20-50%)
Cerulopasmin 27 (15-30 mg/dl).
Alpha-1-antitrypsin 150 (90-200mg/dl).
• Serology: Positive for HCV with detectable viral load (14.00UI/ml) and positive HIV serology with undetectable viral load.
Rest of negative serology.
• 24-hour urine porphyrin study: Screening for total porphyrins 4773 (10-200) with presence of high intensity peak at 623nm in the fluorometric scanning.
Coproporphyrins 1709 (< 150 μg/gr), Uroporphyrins 3064 (< 30 μg/gr), Delta-aminolevulinic acid 5.52 (< 7.50 mg/l), Porfobilin
• Porphyrins in plasma: 9.5 (0.1 μg/dl) • Histological study of a bullous lesion showed a subepidermal blister▁surrounded by mixed inflammatory infiltrate as well as PAS-positive deposit perivascular material level f
Immunofluorescence revealed IgG deposits on the vessel walls.
Diagnosis Based on clinical, analytical and histological features presented, the patient was diagnosed with a Delayed Cutaneous Porphyria (TCP).
Treatment After diagnosis the patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit where treatment for hepatitis C was initiated with alpha interferon and ribavirin.
We insist on the importance of suppressing clinical triggers (trauma, alcohol consumption) and the use of photoprotection.
On the other hand, given the presence of an alteration in the ferrokinetic profile, we recommend periodic bleeding every 15 days.
After 4 months of treatment, serologic cure of hepatitis C was observed, maintaining an undetectable viral load, as well as a progressive normalization of the ferrokinetic profile and a great improvement in porphyria with resolution.
