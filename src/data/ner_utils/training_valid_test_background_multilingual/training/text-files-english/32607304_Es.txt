51 year old man with a history of hypertension came to the emergency department with dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea and fever.
Having traveled and had no chills, sweating, chest pain, or changes in your urine frequency and bowel movements
She reported having had several episodes of epigastric pain and nausea that had partially improved two days before hospitalization.
On admission to the emergency room, physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.6 °C, respiratory rate of 26 r.p.m., blood pressure of 141/89 mmHg, pulse of 97 l.p.m.
and oxygen saturation of 91% (> 95%) in ambient air.
Arterial gas showed a pH of 7.44 (7.36-7.44), partial oxygen pressure of 79 mmHg (75-100 mmHg) and partial carbon dioxide pressure of 39 mmHg (35-45 mmHg).
Chest auscultation revealed wheezing and snoring.
Agonic breathing and a symmetrical decrease in thoracic expansion were also observed.
The results of a complete blood count were normal, except for▁lymphocites (929 lymphocytes/microliter).
As suspected, pneumonia was initiated constant electronic monitoring of vital signs and administration of acetaminophen by intravenous infusion, ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained to perform coronavirus tests associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using the RT-PCR method; the result was positive.
In coordination with the emergency services, the hospital management and staff interrupted the antibiotic treatment of the patient.
Subsequently, the patient was referred to an isolation unit for clinical observation.
On the first night of admission, the patient's condition continued to worsen and a more thorough evaluation was performed.
Physical examination showed a respiratory rate of 29▁rpm, blood pressure 134/87 mmHg, pulse 120 l.p.m.
and oxygen saturation was 84%.
Continuous positive mechanical ventilation was applied and the antiviral remdesivir was administered to improve oxygen saturation and stop the disease progress.
On the second day of hospitalization, the patient developed fever (39.1 °C) and hypoxemic fever (81.0%), and required mechanical ventilation.
A chest X-ray showed ground glass opacities and bilateral and peripheral consolidations.
These findings explained the progressive deterioration of the respiratory status of the patient and led to a diagnosis of ARDS.
Moreover, the electrocardiographic, troponin and creatine kinase tests were normal.
The next day the patient's condition continued to deteriorate and no improvement was observed.
On physical examination, the patient was ill; her vital signs were: temperature of 37.8 °C, pressure of 138/93 mmHg, pulse of 93 l.p.m.
and oxygen saturation of 83% with respirator.
According to existing guidelines, additional therapy was initiated.
Patients medication was prescribed and hydroxychloroquine was prescribed.
The next day, no significant improvement was seen.
On the fifth day of admission, a thorough physical examination showed normal vital signs, except for an oxygen saturation of 87% and a respiratory rate of 26 l.p.m.
It should be noted that continuous electronic monitoring revealed extensive and diffuse ST-segment elevation, which led the medical team to schedule an electrocardiogram, coronary angiography, and echocardiogram.
Coronary angiography showed normal blood supply to the heart, with no signs of arterial stenosis.
However, the electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, while the transthoracic echocardiogram showed cardiomegaly with a clear decrease in ventricular systolic activity and a fraction of excess of 20%.
High values of troponin (0.29 ng/mL), creatine kinase (20.1 ng/mL) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP; 1.287 pg/mL) were also detected.
These results indicated acute myoperitisitis, so that inotropic support was initiated (dobutamine).
On days 6 and 7 of hospitalization, the patient's vital signs indicated a clear improvement.
Physical examination showed bilateral edema of the lower limbs, blood pressure of 130/83 mmHg, pulse of 88 l.p.m.
and oxygen saturation 89%.
The patient continued on continuous mechanical ventilation and usual medication.
Additionally, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID, indomethacin, 50 mg three times a day) regimen was started on the seventh day of acute myopericarditis hospitalization.
In general, the patient's medical condition worsened for the following days, indicating a lack of clear response to the current therapy.
His ECG showed diffuse ST-segment elevation and the pericardial friction was audible on cardiac auscultation.
Analytical tests of cardiac biomarkers revealed an increase in troponin (18 ng/mL) and creatine kinase (14.7 ng/mL), indicating myocardial injury and recurrent myoperitis.
Consequently, methylprednisolone and colchicine are added to the current medication plan.
A new echocardiogram revealed a clear decrease in the ejection fraction (23%) per without evidence of cardiac tamponade.
A chest X-ray suggested worsening of the underlying ARDS, with bilateral pleural effusion. The patient continued to be treated with an aggressive regimen of rehydration, dobutamine, NSAI, antibiotics and antivirals.
