We report the case of a 42-year-old woman, with a history of a month ago, referred to the emergency department for ruling out acute Cesarean section due to abdominal pain in IDF and vomiting of 24 hours duration.
Physical examination revealed fever with signs of peritoneal irritation.
Laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated CRP (286 mg/l).
Emergency abdominal ultrasound is performed and complemented with MDCT with IV contrast in which there is marked increase of free fluid in the right iliac fossa and left parietocolic gout, as well as a peripheral hypofunctioning vein ipsilateral hypocavalvular with right hypocavalvular vein, right hypocalcity, well defined peripheral fundus ipsilateral fundus, right hypocalcemia, right hypocalcaemia right peripheral vein, right hypocaval
There is also a slight contrast uptake by the right Fallopian tube and the edematous uterus (unable to rule out this edema secondary to recent surgical history).
Findings suggestive of thrombosis of the right ovarian vein and possible inflammatory/infectious pelvic process (PPE) in the clinical context of the patient.
Given the findings, the patient is referred to gynecological emergencies where transvaginal ultrasound is performed, within normal limits.
Medical treatment with anticoagulation and broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy was established, with favorable clinical evolution 48 hours after the beginning of treatment.
