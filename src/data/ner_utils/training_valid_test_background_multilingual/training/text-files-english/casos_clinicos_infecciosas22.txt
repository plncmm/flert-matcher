A 69-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis who had been receiving subcutaneous methotrexate 15 mg weekly for one year.
In the context of a recent exacerbation of this pathology, 90 mg of oral prednisone daily was added to its usual treatment two weeks ago, with an initial dose of 80 mg of intramuscular methylprednisolone.
Faced with this, the patient presented cognitive impairment of 48 hours of evolution due to disorientation and obscure, feverish sensation not thermomet, which was the reason for the Emergency Room of a family member.
In the following hours, the deterioration of the level of consciousness progresses, reason why it is decided to proceed to its tertiary referral hospital.
The first clinical examination performed on the patient revealed the following data: axillary temperature 38.1oC, capillary▁refill blood pressure 130 mmHg, good distal perfusion less than two seconds, and heart rate 80 beats per minute.
The cardiorespiratory, abdominal and cutaneous examination showed no remarkable alterations.
The neurological examination revealed marked ideomotor slowness and temporo-spatial disorientation, with a Glasgow scale score of 15 points.
At that moment he was able to▁obey simple orders, but not those of greater complexity.
Brudzinski's sign was present, and the rest of the examination was normal.
Based on these clinical data, serial hemocultives were extracted and urgent computed tomography (CAT) of the skull was performed, in which no pathological data were observed.
After performing this imaging technique, a lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which showed hyperproteinorrage (584 mg/dL), glycosylated serum leukocytes, clinchiasis/ polymorphonuclear quotient (584 mg/dL).
Gram stain showed gram-positive▁cocci, with a determination of pneumococcal antigen by negative CSF immunoassay (BinaxNOW®).
The hemogram performed in the Emergency Department showed the presence of intense leukocytosis (32,440 cells/diameter with 93% segmented leukocytes), while the only pathological data in the biochemistry was a C-reactive protein (CRP) value of 4 mg.
Empirical treatment guidelines and guidelines based on the patients clinical history were reviewed. First, we thought that the result of determining pneumococcal antigen in CSF could correspond to a false negative rate of vancomycin 8kg per day.
However, the clinical evolution was unfavorable in the following hours, developing global aphasia and hypertension figures compatible with hypertensive emergency, reason why it was decided to enter the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
In this unit meningitis due to ampicillin treatment (2 grams every 4 hours) due to the clinical severity and the patient was over 50 years of age, a fact that has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of noncompliance.
The Clinical Microbiology Service isolated Staphylococcus aureus in the CSF, whose susceptibility profile subsequently showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to cloxacillin ≤ 0.25 μg/mL each treatment directed to cloxacillin 4 hours.
No bacteremia was observed at any time of admission.
Because the entrance door of the pathogen to the central system was unknown, a magnetic resonance imaging of the▁thorax and abdomen was performed, in which an extensive multiloculated retroperitoneum archwire was observed between the right and vertebral arches.
A percutaneous drainage of the collection was performed by means of the Seldinger technique by the Interventional Radiology Service.
S. aureus was again isolated from a sample of dried purulent material with the same resistance profile and MICs.
Subsequently, the patient experienced a paulatine improvement, including the neurological symptoms described until she was asymptomatic.
A subsequent CT scan showed the disappearance of the collection for hypersensitivity, datum, which together with the normalization of acute phase reactants was used to decide the final duration of treatment IV.
Final diagnosis The final diagnosis was meningitis due to S. aureus secondary to a paraspinal abscess in a patient immunocompromised by treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate.
Despite the different complementary tests performed, a gateway could not be demonstrated.
In our opinion, the origin of the collection could be the ipsilateral intramuscular puncture that the patient received two weeks before starting the clinic described as initial dose of corticoid treatment prescribed for her sprouting rheumatoid arthritis, as we did not find any other possible conversation.
In any case, we cannot rule out with absolute certainty that this abscess appeared later to the meningeal clinic.
We also believe that the role of iatrogenesis in this case is very important, since cellular and humoral immunosuppression secondary to methotrexate and corticoids played an important role in its initial clinical course.
