Diagnosis of a 25-year-old patient with headache associated with episodes of sensory and language disorder, with CSF pleocytosis, we performed the following differential diagnosis: Infectious encephalitis due to bacteria or viruses
• Autoimmune encephalopathy.
• Vascular etiology.
• Origin epi.
• Headache syndrome and transient neurological deficits with CSF pleocytosis (NDL) or pseudomigraña with pleocytosis.
A battery of diagnostic tests was carried out, which excluded most of the exposed diagnoses.
The most probable diagnosis was headache syndrome and transient neurological deficits with pleocytosis in the CSF (NDL).
Treatment Analgesic treatment for headache was administered during hospitalization.
The patients dementia and dementia diminished favorably and the episodes did not present new focal neurological symptoms.
