An 11-year-old girl who, after taking an yogur with almonds and halos, developed dyspnea, dysphagia, rhinoconjunctivitis, urticaria and labial angioedema.
She was treated with conservative treatment.
After 8 hours, the clinical symptoms reappeared and the patient was admitted, repeating 2-3 episodes a day, which required a total of 5 doses of ̈non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ̈ for 4 days.
Study with negative tryptase results, skin tests and food-specific IgE, and C1 quantitative and functional inhibitor.
Tolerance to milk, nuts, pistachios and cistern trucks was demonstrated, pending the performance of an oral exposure test to other nuts.
An 8-year-old boy who, after taking amoxicillin and ibuprofen due to tooth extraction, presented labial edema and generalized urticaria, treated with dexchlorferinamine and prednisone.
After 12 hours, symptoms persisted, adding abdominal pain and vomiting, which resolved with conservative treatment.
After 4 hours the symptoms reappeared and she was admitted, requiring 13 doses of radiation during 4 days.
Among the episodes, the patient had a mild urticariform exanthema.
The analytical study (serial tryptase, complement, C1 quantitative and functional inhibitor, eosinophil cationic protein, serology, Phadiatop, and penicillin- and amoxicillin-specific IgE) was negative.
The patient did not come to follow-up visits and therefore no skin or exposure tests were performed.
