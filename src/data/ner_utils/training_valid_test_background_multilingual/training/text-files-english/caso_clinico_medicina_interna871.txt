A 43-year-old man with no history of seizures due to bilateral ophthalmitis of probable infectious etiology.
He had lost weight for one year without asthenia or anorexia and self-limiting catarrhal symptoms one week earlier.
She had no risky sexual intercourse 6 months earlier.
Physical examination revealed exanthema in the trunk and palmoplantar lesions suggestive of syphilitic gomas, without palpable adenopathies and other normal findings.
‚ñÅComplementary tests - Analytical: biochemistry, blood count, coagulation and normal venous gases.
- chest X-ray: normal.
- ECG: normal.
Given the suspicion of infectious cutaneous colitis and the patient's lesions, the first diagnostic suspicion was syphilis with ocular involvement, so we requested positive serology (RPR: positive, title 1/256, TPHA:
Once the diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed, we proceeded to rule out neurological involvement by brain CT (normal) and CSF measurement, being negative.
We requested other serologies (EBV, CMV, Toxoplasma, HAV, HCV and HDV negative; HIV positive; HBsAG positive HBV, total anti-HBc negative, HBeAg negative).
With the definitive diagnosis of colitis secondary to ocular syphilis and HIV coinfection stage C3-HBV, the next step was to request mantoux (negative), HIV study and CT chest-abdomen-pelvis to rule out hepatomegaly.

Resistance test: V108I (possible resistance to neviparin).
Lymphocyte subpopulations: CD4 152, CD8 796, CD4/CD8 0.19.
