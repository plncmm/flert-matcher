We report the case of a 36-year-old man from Morocco who had been living in Spain for 6 months, with no known drug allergies or toxic habits.
The only antecedent was that he worked in a slaughterhouse for one month, although he had not worked there for five months.
The patient was seen in the emergency room due to bilateral low back pain radiating to the abdomen for two months, with difficult control despite second-step analgesia.
He also mentions sporadic fever peaks, profuse sweating and dysuria, which does not occur at the time of consultation.
On physical examination, the patient was in good general condition, although he was affected by pain, conscious and oriented in three types of pain, well hydrated and perfused, with normal color and eupneic at rest, without needing supplementary oxygen.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, with blood pressure (BP) of 118 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% without oxygen and temperature of 35.6o.
Upon cardiopulmonary auscultation, the patient shows rhythmic tone without murmurs or audible extracts, as well as a vesicular murmur preserved without pathological sounds.
The abdomen was blandom and depresible, slightly painful to the palpation generalized, especially in the left flank, with no signs of peritoneal irritation and present hydroaerial sounds.
The extremities showed absence of signs of deep venous thrombosis, without edema or signs of chronic venous insufficiency, with pedal pulses present and symmetrical bilaterally.
As for the osteomuscular examination, the patient presented with bilateral lumbar pain due to palpation of the muscles for lumbosacra and spinous processes, without crepitation or other alterations.
The maneuvers of Lassegué and Bragard were positive at 20o bilaterally, as well as the pain reproduction maneuvers at the sacroiliac level.
No other alterations were identified in the rest of the examination by equipment.
On admission, a lumbar spine X-ray was performed in which a correction of the physiological lordosis was identified, without other remarkable alterations, as well as a chest X-ray with a cardiomediastinal silhouette of normal size and other findings.
The blood count at admission showed a normal result in all three series, as well as a erythrocyte sedimentation rate (GSR) of 20 mm/h.
Biochemistry showed a slight elevation of transaminase (AST 57 mg/dl and ALT 71 mg/dl), as well as a C-reactive protein (CRP) of▁37.76 mg/l.
Creatinine levels were within normal limits, and there were no alterations in the systematic urine analysis.
Urocultiva was performed prior to admission showing a negative result.
Abdominal pain was diagnosed and an abdominal ultrasound was requested. The only notable finding was a sacral slope with 162 mm longitudinal axis and homogeneous echogenicity.
The association of dysuria led to contact with the Urology Department, which after assessing the patient identified a solid thickening of the head of the left epididymis compatible with epididymitis.
Due to the clinical presentation of lumbosacral pain and the exploratory findings, a lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested, which showed the presence of sacral pinzing, with posterior sacral-like abscess, with enhancement in ST1 and epidural space.
The approximate measurements are 39 mm x 12.5 mm x 21.5 mm.
Differential diagnosis For the differential diagnosis, based on the findings obtained in the lumbosacral MRI, with the presence of abscess formation and local inflammatory signs, we can focus our attention on pathologies of infectious origin.
• Pyogenic infection: S. aureus is the most common microorganism related to pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, followed by E. coli1, being the primary focus of infection in the urinary tract, blemish skin or skin in 50% of patients.
Virulent microorganisms such as Pseudomonas spp, Salmonella spp, or S. aureus itself generate abscesses for inguinal tissues that can evolve at a normal level, adjacent organs, while glue more indolent parallel micro-organisms generate abscesses
Fever, leukocytosis and sweating are symptoms that usually appear in osteomyelitis of pyogenic origin, with a rapid and aggressive clinical course.
In the case of our patient, the association of dysuria and fever and sweating symptoms could guide this pathology, but the absence of leukocytosis and insidious evolution for more than two months guide us to make alternative diagnoses.
• Vertebral tuberculosis: also called Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis, this is a diagnosis to be considered in cases of persistent and insidious low back pain, especially if accompanied by constitutional symptoms.
Tuberculous spondylitis is usually preceded by a previous infection, which can occur asymptomatically, so the lack of knowledge on the part of the patient exposed to tuberculosis does not rule out this pathology.
Our patient comes from Morocco, considered an endemic area of tuberculosis, with an estimated incidence rate of 50-99 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
In addition, the clinical presentation of dysuria may be related to possible renal or genital tuberculosis.
The presence of profuse sweating, loss of appetite and fever in our patient could favor vertebral tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis.
• Brucellosis: this disease, typically associated with the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products and contact with animal tissues contaminated by Brucella spp. in cattle, pigs or goats, is usually endemic with fever prospecific symptoms in northern continent.
These symptoms can be maintained between two and eight weeks and musculoskeletal involvement (which is the most common complication of brucellosis) does not usually occur until the previous symptoms go away.
The appearance of abscesses for▁parasites is less frequent than in tuberculosis, although their presence is possible.
The diagnosis of brucellosis is made with a positive culture of the microorganism in any sample or by measurement of agglutinins bruce.
Leukocytosis is usually not present and SGV elevation, if present, is not relevant.
The involvement of other organs, such as the genitourinary system, although less frequent than musculoskeletal complications, is also possible.
Analysing our patient, the occupational background, his country of origin and the presence of a slight elevation of ESR in the absence of leukocytosis could point to brucellosis as a possible diagnosis.
In addition, the presence of fever peaks intercalated by isolated episodes of aphthous ulcers, as well as the presence of hypersensitivity pneumomegaly detected on abdominal ultrasound, also lead to brucellosis.
The vs. isolation of the results obtained in the MRmbosacra, and the patients occupational history, raises the possibility of an infection of▁zoonotic origin.
Urine cultures were requested, which were negative and hemocultive, and gave a positive result for Brucella mellitensis.
Rose Bengala test was performed, which was positive, with a quantification of antibodies of 1/320.
Once the diagnosis was established, antibiotic treatment was initiated with triple therapy consisting of 100 mg amoxicillin every 12 hours, rifampicin 600 mg every 24 hours, and gentamicin for 7 days intravenously.
It was decided, given the size of the abscess and its clinical origin, to contact the Neurosurgery Service for drainage of the collection, which was successfully performed, taking samples that were cultured with negative results.
After the beginning of treatment, the patient presented a slow but progressive improvement of pain, so he was discharged home to continue treatment with dual therapy of rifampicin and rifampicin for 12 weeks.
She was assessed in outpatient clinics for infectious diseases 15 days after discharge, referring to the patient with poor control of low back pain, so it was decided to increase the daily dose of rifampicin to 900 mg every 24 hours.
During the following months she required two new admissions for poor control of low back pain despite second step analgesic treatment.
Control lumbosacral MRI was requested in both cases, with no apparent changes in the evolution of the infectious process, although no radiological worsening was identified.
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery Department, without identifying the need for abscess drainage at that time.
In both admissions, the patient presented satisfactory pain control, initially with intravenous medication and later with good tolerance to change with oral medication.
The patient was evaluated in the outpatient clinic for infectious diseases three months after the last admission, with no new incidents and adequate pain control.
A new control by lumbosacra MRI was requested, with the objective of practical resolution of the initial infectious process, with disappearance of the epidural abscess and almost complete absence of signs of spondylitis at the level of L5 and S1 vertebral bodies.
Final diagnosis Lumbar spondylodyscitis due to Brucella melitensis with local extension to posterior epidural space and first sacral hole, accessification at this level and bacteremia.
