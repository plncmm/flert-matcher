A 75-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure on hemodialysis, and a prosthesis for abdominal aortic aneurysm was presented.
Six years after implantation, the patient presented episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with a pro-duodenal fistula.
18F-FDG PET/CT was requested to rule out prosthetic infection, showing an increase in periprosthetic uptake in the abdominal aortic portion located between L2-L3.
The midline is about 4 cm and has an SUV of 6.7 anterior, which is thickened (2.6), probably related to the infectious process. The maximum aortic wall is probably related to the normal aortic wall.
Posterior CTA showed aneurysmal aorta of 4 cm, subrenal subrating ulcer of 7.7 mm and 5.5 mm in depth, as well as coverage of penetrating iliac vein with both territories.
It was decided to perform vascular bypass by left axillary-bifemoral bypass.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed episodes of sepsis and syncope.
Emergency surgery was performed with removal of the prosthesis and section fistuladuodenal.
Pathological anatomy shows tubular segment of pro-fibrinolytic material 9 Ã— 3 cm, which has coagulated material inside and adhered remnants where Enterococcus avium is isolated and sensitive to ampicillin.
Therefore, 18F-FDG PET/CT has proven to be a sensitive and useful technique in the diagnostic orientation of infectious processes in vascular prostheses.
