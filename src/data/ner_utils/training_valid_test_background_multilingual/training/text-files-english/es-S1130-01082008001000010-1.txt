A 43-year-old man from Morocco was admitted to our service due to a 4-day history of painless mucocutaneous jaundice, choluria and generalized pruritus.
The only antecedents of interest were treated tuberculosis, hypercholesterolemia in dietary treatment and mild smoking.
The laboratory analysis showed the following data: bilirubin 19.44 mg/dl, AST 110 IU/ml, ALT 371 IU/ml, GGT 632 IU/ml, AP 787 IU/ml, LDH 394
Amylase and lipase were normal at all times.
Hypergammaglobulinemia (1.56% gammaglobulin), with IgG 1840 IU/ml (751-1.560 IU/ml), was also observed.
CA 19-9 marker was 82 IU/ml.
The autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, AMA-2, ANCA, LKM1, SMA, SLA and F-actin) and serology for viruses and bacteria (VHA, Rixoplasma par HSV19, HBV, virus) were negative
Abdominal ultrasound showed dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed an enlarged pancreas with a focal lesion of 3 cm in the head and mild posterior dilation of the pancreatic duct.
retroperitoneal adipose tissue showed an extension of the pancreas increased in size, hypodense, with a peripancreatic halo hypodense, with smooth edge, without involvement of peripancreatic fat, and a bilateral peripancreatic
Persistence of pruritus and manifest biliary stasis was performed percutaneous drainage showing cholangiography a stenosing lesion in distal bile duct suggestive of pancreatic neoplasia.
This possibility as the first differential diagnosis was made by EUS guided needle aspiration with negative cytology for malignant cells and negative Zielh staining.
Due to the absence of confirmation of neoplasia, and with the suspicion of autoimmune pancreatitis, endoscopic‚ñÅretrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, revealing dilation of the main bile duct with a regular stenosis in its authentic aspect of 3 cm.
Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone at a dose of 32 mg/day) were started and percutaneous drainage was removed.
With the diagnosis of probable IAP, the patient was discharged and followed up on an outpatient basis with evidence of normalization of all analytical parameters and resolution in the control abdominal CT scan, one month later and four months later the pancreatic fibrosis disappeared.
The corticosteroid dose was progressively decreased until complete withdrawal at 4 months, with biliary stent removal.
To date, after 24 months of follow-up, asymptomatic patients have suffered from autoimmune pancreatitis without recurrence of retroperitoneal fibrosis.
