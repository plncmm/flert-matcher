A 65-year-old female ex-smoker, with no alcohol habit, with a history of multilobar in 2013 by S. malphilia, under treatment with vitamin D by November of August 2014 for chronic pneumonia, who began follow-up in
Physical examination revealed a palpable splenic pole at 4 cm below the costal margin, with no other findings.
Analytically, Hb 17.3 g/dl, platelets 63000/ul (88000 by manual count), leucocytes 3500/ul, peripheral blood smears without findings, biochemical with▁ferric globulin-HCV seroglobin, thyroid gamma-H hormones
Abdominal CT scan showed a 15 cm enlarged spleen and hepatomegaly with a right liver lobe of 18 cm in longitudinal diameter, with normal Doppler study.
In May▁2015, the patient was admitted for left basal pneumonia without microbiological isolations, followed by outpatient study.
In the electrophoretic profile, hypogammaglobulinemia (gamma band 6.8%) persists after challenge with immunoglobulin G and Ig A, associated with CD4▁lymphopenia and mild B lymphocyte count, with an adequate immune response.
The patient remains asymptomatic, with no semiological or analytical changes until March 2016, when she consulted for pain in the left hypochondrium starting in the previous 4 days, irradiating to the ipsilateral iliac crest, with no more pronounced symptoms cm.
Analytically stands out Hb 10.3 g/dl, platelets 56000/ul, leukocytes 2500/ul, LDH 350 U/l, beta-2-microglobulin 6.8 mg/l, direct peripheral blood smear negative findings 5.7%, Coomb.
Bone marrow biopsy and CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed, with a finding of a 23x19x10 cm cystomegaly with an▁incipient perfusion defect subsided.
PET-CT shows diffuse increase in metabolic activity in the spleen and supra- and infradiaphragmatic lymphadenopathy.
Diagnostic and therapeutic approach was performed, obtaining a piece of resection with 2870 g, 24x20x8 cm, with red pulps and histological grade B lymphocytes compatible with immunochemistry.
