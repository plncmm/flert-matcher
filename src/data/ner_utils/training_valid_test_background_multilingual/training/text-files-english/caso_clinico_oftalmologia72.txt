A 34-year-old male patient diagnosed with chickenpox three weeks before, resolved without complications.
He came to the emergency room with decreased visual acuity in his left eye.
In the exploration, a corrected visual acuity of 1 in the right eye (OD) and 0.6 in the left eye (LE) was found.
The study with a slit lamp shows a 4+ cellular tyndall in the left eye, precipitated or inferior to the right eye (3D+) and without showing fluorescein staining.
Intraocular pressure was 16mmHg in both eyes.
The funduscopic examination of the left eye revealed mild stenosis (1+), with no focal seizures.
Topical treatment with corticosteroids and midline
Two days later, a decrease in the anterior chamber (3+) of the cellular tyndall was observed, but a peripheral focus of mild necrotizing colitis associated with temporal area urticaria was observed.
The patient was admitted to the hospital with intravenous ablative therapy (10 mgr/kg/8 hours), antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid 150 mgr/24 hours) and topical treatment was maintained.
Prophylactic photocoagulation was performed with laser photocoagulation. The area of necrosis was confirmed 48 hours later and a good response was observed. A decrease in visual focus was observed when the focus was centered on a lesser amount of corticoids.
Two weeks later, antiviral treatment (fampicillin 500 mgr/12 hours) was started and corticoids gradually decreased at a rate of 10 mgr every week.
Antiviral treatment was continued at maintenance doses for 6 weeks, with periodic analytical tests blood count and biochemical tests to detect renal involvement.
Six months after the onset of the disease, the patient remains asymptomatic, with visual acuity in the left eye unit, scarring of the lesions and complete absence of ocular inflammatory activity in both eyes.
During admission, a recent infection by the varicella zoster virus was confirmed by seroconversion.
