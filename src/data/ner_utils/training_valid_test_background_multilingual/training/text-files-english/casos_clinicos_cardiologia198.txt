A 72-year-old male patient with a bioprosthesis aortic stenosis in 2010 was diagnosed with prosthetic endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis 5 years after the intervention.
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed an abscess at the level of the mitral-aortic junction, 11 mm in diameter, with a vegetation of 9 mm attached to the ventricular face of the non-coronary velum.
A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large gas-containing abscess inside the aortic root, extending into the right ventricular outflow tract.
The presence of gas bubbles inside the pulmonary artery trunk was also observed.
Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) confirmed the extent of infection in both locations.
During surgery, the prosthesis was replaced with a▁cryopreserved aortic valve homograft sutured subcoronaryly.
Surgical samples were positive for the same microorganism isolated in blood.
No gross involvement of the main pulmonary artery was found.
The free wall of the right ventricular tract explored, and although it was found to be compact, its puncture did not obtain any pathological product, discarding▁frank voids at this level.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
18F-FDG PET/CT did not show residual gas or significant 18F-FDG uptake.
The control blood cultures were similarly negative.
