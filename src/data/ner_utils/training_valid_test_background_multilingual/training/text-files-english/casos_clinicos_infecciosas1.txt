A 28-year-old woman referred allergy to penicillin studied in childhood by the Allergology Service, with intradermal testing.
No other known medical-surgical history of interest.
She had toxic habits.
He did not undergo treatment in a usual way.
The patient was referred to our primary care physician due to a 10-day history of odynophagia and self-palpation of cervical lymph nodes.
Examination revealed tonsils everywhere with blanche▁exudate, clarithromycin instaured. Oral corticotherapy (three times daily) was prescribed (three times daily), and oral antibiotics (three times daily) were administered empirically.
At 48 hours, the patient came to the emergency room due to worsening of her general condition, with fever up to 39.7oC, dry cough, dyspnea and right costal pain of pleuritic characteristics.
Upon arrival, the patient was febrile (38.3o), hypotensive (84/40 mmHg), tachypnea (120 bpm) and tachypnea (30 rpm).
The physical examination revealed: cardiopulmonary auscultation with tachycardic rhythmic tone and good vesicular murmur with biphasic dry crackles; abdomen and lower extremities without findings.
The otorhinolaryngological examination showed a mild tonsillar▁exudate with multiple cervical adenopathies measuring 1–2 cm, not adhered to deep, painful and mobile planes.
The examination did not show any pathological findings in the teeth.
The complementary tests requested in the emergency department showed the following results: hemoglobin 10.7 mg/dl, leukocytes 47,000/ul, with 44,120 absolute neutrophils and platelets 160,000/uL.
Leukocytosis with neutrophilia to mature elements was observed in the smear, with significant accumulation and presence of some cavitations.
Not platelet aggregates.
Coagulation with INR 1.4 with times within normal limits.
Renal function with a glomerular filtration rate of 0.7 mg/dL estimated according to CKD-EPI of 105.90 ml/min/1.73 m2, normal lymphocyte count/dL, normal abdominal profile (Bilirubin 0.537 mg/dL).
Venous gas shows pH 7.34, pO2 61 mmHg, pCO2 35 mmHg, HCO3- 19 mE/L, lactate 2.7 mosm/L.
Chest radiography showed normal cardiothoracic lobe and mild infiltrated pleural effusion (Radiography of▁thorax: non-inferior infiltrate and pulmonary nodules in both bases) and abdominal ultrasound (US).
The differential diagnosis with cutaneous syndrome, without doubt obtained in the anamnesis requested in the emergency department, we propose as syndromic judgment severe sepsis of otorhinolaryngological/respiratory origin, with the following diagnostic possibilities:
• Septic thrombophlebitis or Lemierre's syndrome, as factors in favour, we found a septic condition in the context of a possible respiratory disorder, the presence of respiratory symptoms (shortness and dyspnea).
• However, at the moment we did not have enough complementary tests, nor a determining semiology in the cervical exploration, to affirm that the patient had a thrombosis of the jugular vein.
• Ludwig's Angina, practically discarded due to the presentation of the condition and the absence of inflammatory signs in the floor of the mouth and submandibular region.
• Plaut-Vincent Angina, we cannot initially rule out it, despite the otorhinolaryngological examination described above, since there is no ulceronecrotic lesion with membrane formation.
• Mononucleic overinfection, is proposed in the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, odynophagia and hypertrophy of the colon, except for severe leukocytosis a treat of neutrophils, which would make it difficult to diagnose.
• Community-acquired pneumonia, in principle we would encounter a mixed profile, atypical by the absence of clear radiological consolidation, dry cough without expectoration, and typical for high fever and neutrophilic leukocytosis.
The patients history of emergency admission to the hospital ward had already started empirical treatment with clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours) since the penicillin allergy staff.
The patient was in a situation of septic shock, with AT 90/40 mmHg, HR 120 bpm and tachypnea of 30 breaths per minute.
The patient was evaluated by the staff of the left clindamycin and bacteraemia program (600 mg every 6 hours IV) and requested urgent cervical-thoracic CT, which showed an internal apharyngeal abscess.
left parapharyngeal abscess and thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein) as well as bilateral cavitated pulmonary nodules compatible with septic embolisms, associated with bilateral pleural effusion, which was drained pleural effusion CT pleural effusion compatible with pleural effusion
After 48 hours of microbiological isolation results were obtained.
Fus spp was isolated from the hemocultive, pending definitive identification and antibiogram.
Antigenuria of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was negative.
Sputum culture was also negative for bacteria and mycobacteria.
The serology of pneumonia, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetti and virus was negative, as was the case of Elomega virus, human hepatitis, and hepatitis B.
Data collected (CT and blood culture), as well as the absence of clinical improvement, presenting hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension refractory to fluid therapy, were assessed in the Intensive Care Unit, which decided to be admitted to the ICU.
During her stay in the ICU she underwent cordectomy and abscess drainage by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and evaluation by the Allergy Service, which performed skin tests with major and minor determinants of▁benzylline
After this, a penicillin-controlled exposure test was performed, and combined antibiotic treatment with pecinylline (4 MU every 4 hours) and clindamycin (600mg every 6 hours IV heparin), molecular methylprednisolone (60mg every 8 hours).
Vasoactive amines were not required.
The final result of the hemocultives was received, reporting the isolation of Fus necrophorum sensitive to penicillin, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, clindamycin, and metronidazole, and the pleural fluid culture was negative.
After these therapeutic measures, the patient showed progressive improvement without requiring mechanical ventilation or vasoactive amines.
A control cervical-thoracic CT was performed with a favorable radiological response, and later transferred to the hospital ward for infectious diseases.
Analytical controls were performed and showed improvement of symptoms, despite persistence of residual lesions, in the form of smaller pulmonary nodules and chronic thrombosis of the left jugular vein.
Given the patient's stability, discharge was decided on day + admission, with treatment with clindamycin clinda mg every 8 weeks plus descending order of midazolam 12 hours at home 60 mg in descending order of hospital.
The patient was reviewed in the Infectious Diseases outpatient clinic 2 weeks after hospital discharge, where clinical improvement was observed, with a practically disappearance of the odynophagia clinic and normalization of blood count and acute phase reactants.
Final diagnosis Lemierre syndrome with presence of perianal abscess and parapharyngeal complicated with septic thromboflebitis of the left internal jugular vein and bilateral septic pulmonary embolisms and pleural empyema.
