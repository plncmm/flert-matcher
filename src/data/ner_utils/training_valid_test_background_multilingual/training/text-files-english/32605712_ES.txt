A 30-year-old woman, with no remarkable past medical history, presented with nocturnal▁parosmia (with intense smell of sweaty feet) for several hours.
The next day she felt something indisposed.
She had no specific symptoms (e.g., fever).
Two days later she reported total loss of smell and taste.
An otolaryngologist diagnosed complete anosmia.
Steroids were administered topically twice a day.
Post-viral hyposmia was diagnosed but, in the absence of known symptoms, no infection with SARS-CoV-2 was detected.
The anosmia started to improve 6 days later until it completely disappeared.
A cranial MRI showed no abnormalities.
Fourteen days after▁parosmia, hyposmia has been reported to be a symptom of infection by SARS-CoV-2.
One day later, a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive.
