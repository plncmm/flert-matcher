In an initial laboratory test: leukocytes 6310/μl (segmented 67%, fallen 6%, lymphocytes 19%, monocytes 8%), hemoglobin (Hb) 10.9 g/dl, hematocrit (Hto) 29.6%, reactive protein
Lumbar puncture was performed: glucose 51.3 mg/dl, protein 133.9 mg/dl (hemorrhagic liquid).
Given the suspicion of severe bacterial infection, she was admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment with cefoxime and ampicillin (200 mg/kg/day), adding herpes simplex virus within the following 24 hours (60 mg/kg/day).

Chest X-ray : Bilateral alveolointerstitial infiltrates Radiography, more striking on the left side, suggestive of acute pulmonary edema.
