At 20:00 p.m. on February 1, 2020, a 40-week-old woman presented with a small vaginal bleeding and pain in the lower abdominal region.
Two hours later, the patient developed fever (37.8 °C) and came to Wuhan's maternal and child care center.
As she had fever, she was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of the Tongji de Wuhan hospital the next morning.
A chest CT scan showed ground glass opacities in the upper and lower left lobes, indicating the possibility of viral pneumonia.
A chest CT scan of the mother, obtained on February 2, 2020, showed signs of infection in the left lower and upper lobes and indicated the possibility of viral pneumonia, with reduced emphysema in the right lower lobe and a small emphysema in the right lower lobe.
Blood tests showed <▁lymphoreactive concentrations (0,99 × 109 cells/L [normal: 1.1–3.2 × 109 cells/L]), neutrophilia (9.97 × 109 cells/L [normal: 1.8– 6.3 × cells]) and
It was decided to hospitalize the patient for viral pneumonia.
On admission, her temperature was 37.8 °C, blood pressure was 131/89 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 r.p.m.
And pulse 96 l.p.m.
He had no cough or expectoration.
The fetal pulse was 136 l.p.m.
and his record showed no abnormalities.
An emergency cesarean section was performed.
Intraoperatively, amniotic fluid was observed with meconium.
At 8:45 the patient gave birth a child weighing 3025 g. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 8 and 9, respectively.
The child did not regress after delivery.
The skin was red and the tear was loud.
The mother wore an N95 mask and, after the intervention, the child did not have contact with the mother.
The child was transferred to the neonatology unit 10 minutes after delivery for close monitoring; the mother was transferred to the infectious diseases ward for isolation after the intervention.
Time after delivery, the child vomited once after being fed with artificial milk and was considered to have dysphagia.
After gastric lavage, the child could be fed without complications.
Blood tests of the newborn showed▁lymphocytic mol [normal [43 × 109 cells/L [normal: 3–8 × 109 cells/L]), abnormal liver tests (79 × 416.8 L ≤ 26 μL]): high bilirubin U/aminotransferase 143
Penicillin G (150,000 U once a day, intravenous bolus) and vitamin K1 (1 mg once a day, IV) were administered.
as antibiotic prophylaxis and to prevent coagulopathies, respectively.
The mother remained in good condition and afflicted during the immediate postoperative period.
She did not have cough or any other discomfort, such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
His vital signs were stable, with an oxygen saturation of 99%.
Antiviral treatment was administered with 40 μg of inhaled atomized recombinant human α1b interferon 2 mL of sterility solution twice daily and 12 hours of IV administration (0,25 g).
Abipenem was also administered (0.3 g every 12 hours, IV).
(0.4 g once daily, iv)
infections.
The mother had intermittent fever during the first postoperative day, reaching 38.3 °C; methylprednisolone (20 mg IV) was administered.
Her throat swab for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive on the same day.
The newborns throat swab was immediately collected after delivery, together with the mothers milk.
We recommend that mothers do not breastfeed their children and extract milk to avoid discomfort.
The neurological response of the newborn was acceptable during the first day after delivery, and oxygen saturation remained > 92% without medication.
The analytical tests of the child were negative for Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ritpalia, adenovirus, respiratory viruses without infection, influenza A virus 1 B and 3.
On February 4, the second postoperative day, the mother's vital signs were stable and she was given prednisolone (40 mg once a day IV).
The neonate remained healthy and had a base of oxygen saturation/↑ pH of 7.476, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 28.2 mm Hg↓, partial pressure of oxygen of 116.0 mm Hg↑L, bicarbonate of 20.6 mmol.
Tests for a set of pediatric viruses were negative for cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, Toxoplasma gondii, herpes common virus types 1 and 2, ecovirus, parvovirus Coxzockieamprena virus type 16 Epamp
A chest CT scan of the newborn showed thickening of the lung texture without cardiac abnormalities.
Chest CT of the newborn, obtained on February 4, 2020, which shows a thickening of the lung texture without cardiac abnormalities.
The child was fed with artificial milk, 25 mL every 3 hours, and closely monitored.
On February 5, the vital signs of the newborn were stable, with oxygen saturation above 90% and without discomfort such as apnea or vomiting.
The result of the pharyngeal swab for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive 36 hours after delivery.
Combining all analytical tests and an exhaustive exchange of ideas, we diagnosed that the child had SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As the neonatal department of the Tingji Hospital does not have isolation conditions for the newborn, it was transferred to the Children's Hospital of Wuhan that same day for better isolation.
After finding the evidence of neonatal infection, we performed nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 in umbilical cord blood and placental samples that we had preserved during the intervention; the results were negative.
The breast milk sample was also negative for SARS-CoV-2.
We followed the newborn's condition after being transferred to the Wuhan Children's Hospital.
His condition was good and afflicted, with no cough or vomiting.
He was closely monitored in isolation conditions and no special treatment was given.
A chest CT scan on February 6, showed nodular high density sounds under the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung.
A chest CT scan of February 12 showed small patchy cores in the lower and upper lobes of the right lung.
In a chest CT scan of February 17, a few small nuclei of patchy shadows were observed in the lower and upper lobes of the right lung, absorbed in comparison with the previous ones.
On February 17, 2020, nucleic acid tests of pharyngeal and anal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were negative.
The newborn was discharged on February 18, 2020.
