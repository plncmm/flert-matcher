To study the hypersensitivity to potato in a 6-year-old child who consults for presenting refusal to eat and later episodes of vomiting after eating it, as well as urticaria after ingestion of egg, nuts and dried fruits.
Material and methods: Skin tests were performed on patients with pneumoal ulcers and food, prick-prick test for food, total IgE, specific IgE, and determination of SDS-Page and Immunoblotting.
Results: Skin prick tests were negative; with food was detected positivity for eggs, nuts (birds, nuts and pineapple) and vegetables (footwear and kernel).
The prick-prick was positive to carrot (crude), potato (crude and cooked), light brown and nut.
Total IgE = 437 U/ ml, egg white IgE = 1.41 kU/L, avellane = 2.53 kU/L, potato >100 kU/L, egg white = 1.38 kU/L,
SDS-PAGE is performed with a potato extract in which bands of approximately 43, 25 and 16 kDa are observed.
Immunoblotting recognizes two bands at 43 and 16 kDa., which establishes the molecular weight with the authentic proteases Solrin t 1 (patatin) and Sol t 4 (seinhibitory 7).
Conclusions: â€“ The diagnosis of hypersensitivity to potato due to Sol t 1 and Sol t 4 with concomitant hypersensitivity to carrots, eggs, pineapple, nuts and hazelnut is confirmed
