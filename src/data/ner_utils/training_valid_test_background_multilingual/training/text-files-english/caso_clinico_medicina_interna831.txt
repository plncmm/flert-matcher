We report the case of a 50-year-old male, born in Guinea Conakry, resident for nine years in Spain, seropositive in antiretroviral treatment (TDF/ FTC/EFV).
He made a four-month trip to his country, where he began with diarrhea and abdominal pain requiring hospitalization.
The patient had CD4 77/μL, Hb 7.2 g/dl, normal abdominal ultrasound, stools and stool tests negative.
She received empirical treatment with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, fluconazole, cotrimoxazole and improvement.
AZT/3TC and LPV/r were changed.
Three months after his return to Spain, he again began a two-week clinical picture with 4-8 liquid stools without pathological products, nausea, epi-mesogastric pain of 10 kg, prostration and weight loss.
On admission, he presented hypotension, creatinine 1.7 mg/dl,▁eosinophils 5,260/μL, CD4 211/μL and HIV viremia of 1100/ml.
Coprocultives, Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica antigens, and serology of Cryptosporidium in▁faeces, thick blood smear, microfilariae in blood were negative.
Sequential empirical treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, cotrimoxazole, albendazole, praziquantel and ivera, with clinical improvement.
Gastroscopy was performed and biopsies showed no abnormalities.
Upon discharge, the patient was switched to DTG/ABC/3TC and prophylactic daily cotrimoxazole was maintained.
Remaining bedridden decreased the dose of cotrimoxazole and two weeks later required a new admission due to a similar picture to the previous one.
This time they were visualized in oocystic feces of Cystoisospora belli, improving the picture quickly after a new cycle of cotrimoxazole and prolonged secondary prophylaxis.
