A 37-year-old male patient with a one-month history of headache was admitted to the Emergency Department.
He reported that since adolescence he suffered sporadic episodes of hemicraneal headache with associated photophobia and malaphobia, which he never consulted.
He was a smoker of about 20 cigarettes per day and as a relevant personal history, had only one surgical intervention in childhood, after trauma to the right elbow.
He reported a perianal abscess two months before the onset of headache successfully treated with cloxacillin, without drainage, and a mild clavulanic acid one month before, which was resolved after seven days of amoxicillin-acid treatment.
Approximately one month before his admission to the emergency room, he began to suffer right hemicraneal, pulsatile headache for several days.
The pain persisted throughout the day, being more intense in the afternoon, and was maintained at night, although allowing the patient to rest.
During the first days, mild dizziness and paranasal sinuses tenderness were observed.
The patient decided to consult his bedside physician when he was diagnosed with headache and sinusitis, and prescribed analgesia with metamizole and antibiotics with ciprofloxacin.
The clinical course reflected the possibility of assessing a study of migraine, which was ruled out when the patient presented initial improvement after such treatment.
However, in only seven days the clinical picture continued to progress, persisting headache of similar characteristics, but now accompanied by fever, diarrheal stools and nausea with vomiting.
Pain worsened with Valsalva maneuvers and associated photophobia and phobia.
The patient then requested urgent care in Primary Care, where he was diagnosed with tension-type headache and gastroenteritis, requesting an ordinary analytical, which was normal.
Despite the correct administration of analgesic and antiemetic treatment, the patient presented a clear worsening, with prostration and tendency to sleep throughout the day, so that three days later his family decided to take him to the Emergency Department.
Physical examination when the patient arrived at the emergency department due to pain was affected.
At the first inspection, the degree of prostration and sensitivity to noise and light stood out, as well as the impression of gravity conveyed.
She was conscious and oriented in space and person, but not in time.
He kept his eyes closed, unless verbally stimulated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 (O3, V4, M6).
The general physical examination was normal, highlighting only slight discomfort to abdominal palpation.
The patient was afflicted with normal color.
Neurological examination revealed pain upon palpation of the paranasal sinuses.
The pupils were isochoric and normoreactive.
There were no campimetry or cranial nerves alterations.
He had a decrease of strength 4/5 in the left limbs, as well as slight hypoesthesia in the same ones with respect to the right ones.
The reflexes were normal and the Romberg test was negative, with no gait alterations.
He did not show dysmetria in the finger-nose test or in the heel-knee test.
No meningismus was detected.
▁Complementary tests • Basic blood count, biochemistry and coagulation tests were requested, in which mild neutrophilia (81.6%) without leukocytosis, other parameters outside normal ranges were highlighted.
• Urine analysis, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal.
• Cranial computed tomography (CT) with contrast was performed, in which a right temporal expansive intraaxial lesion of 58 mm in diameter, rounded, right midline abscess compatible with hemibacillary dislodgement and peripheric edema was observed.
Cranial computed tomography with contrast, which shows the right temporal abscess, with important displacement of the midline.
Diagnosis▁Right cerebral abscess of otogen origin.
Treatment Treatment was initiated in the emergency department with dexamethasone every 6 h and combined antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
The Neurosurgery Department was contacted urgently, and the abscess was drained urgently.
The otorhinolaryngology service performed a▁tympanoplasty and a radical mastoidectomy in the same surgical procedure.
The patients Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 at all times, without complications, and showed no neurological abnormalities.
Neuroimaging tests showed normal postsurgical changes, without intracranial stenosis and decreased midline shift.
Microbiological study of the material extracted during surgery (pus and abscess capsule) revealed that this had been produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery ward for 23 days, receiving antibiotic treatment.
Serology tests were performed during the patient's admission, which revealed undiagnosed hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency.
At discharge she was treated with ceftriaxone for eight weeks.
