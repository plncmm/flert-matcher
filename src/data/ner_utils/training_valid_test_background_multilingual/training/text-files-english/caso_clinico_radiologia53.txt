An 84-year-old male patient with a history of aortic valve replacement and urothelial carcinoma, was admitted with a diagnosis of radiation enteritis.
She was referred to the diagnostic radiology service for acute abdominal pain associated with hemodynamic instability.
Angiovascular, portal and elimination CT scans were performed.
Multiple hypodense-like areas are visualized in the splenic parenchyma, cortico-subcortical areas, compatible with infarctions.
Moderate amount of dense free fluid of perisplenic location.
A perihilar central hyperdense area was identified, which is isodense with the vessels in all phases of the study and early splenic vein depletion was identified, findings suggestive of vascular resumption.
A contrast-liquid level in the gastrosplenic ligament was observed, suggesting active bleeding.
The interventional radiologist performs selective arteriography of the splenic artery, where contrast extravasation is visualized in splenic hilium, lesion of rounded morphology and early pseudoneural arteriovenous fistula finding.
A diagnosis of atraumatic splenic rupture secondary to splenic infarcts was made.
It has an incidence of 0.1%-0.5% and is classified according to whether it occurs in previously healthy or pathological spleen.
Criteria according to Crate for atraumatic splenic rupture on healthy spleen: -No trauma.
-No injury to other organs linked to splenic pathology.
Absence of splenic trices.
"Bazo macro and microscopically normal.
Negative serology for recent viral infection.
Entities that promote atraumatic splenic rupture: - Infectious affection (mononucleosis) - Acreafection -Alterations congenital (pancreamas) -Other entities
