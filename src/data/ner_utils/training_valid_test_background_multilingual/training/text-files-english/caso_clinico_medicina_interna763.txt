A 73-year-old male with a history of hyperuricemia and depression, who in April 2017, and without previous trauma, presented with progressive pain radiating to the lower limbs, motivating several visits to the emergency department.
He came to the M. Interna's office in September 2017 for a loss of 10 kg of weight, hypoxia and occasional profuse sweating associated with the described low back pain, with normal initial PE.
Analytically, renal function, ionogram, hepatic and thyroid profile, proteinogram, hemogram and coagulation were normal, with negative tumor markers except mild elevation of Cyfra 21.1, and negative serology for HIV and hepatotropic virus.
Basic studies (thorax and spine) were normal.
The loss progressed, so the study was completed with RMN dorsal and lumbar spine, bone scintigraphy and abdominal CT scan, resulting normal.
One month later, the patient worsened clinically, complaining of severe asthenia and difficulty in standing, and underwent PET-CT with inflammatory uptake in the rectum-anal mucosa.
During 10 days, the patient presented associated high fever.
On physical examination BP 107/64 mmHg, HR 100 bpm and Ta38,3o, requiring admission.
The laboratory tests showed elevated levels of acute phase reactants (CRP 330.55 mg/L, ESR 61 mm/h, leukocytosis 23200/Ul), macrocytic anemia, hypolipidemia, and CK 1090
The control‚ñÅthorax-abdomen CT showed edematization of subcutaneous cellular tissue at perineal level and hemococcus periregional air dissection and inflammatory changes in inguinal canal, extraperitoneal pelvis and glculitis region
