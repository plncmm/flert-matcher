A 48-year-old male with no medical history presented with dyspnea on mild exertion and male-to-female edema of 15 days duration.
Examination revealed biphasic and analytical crackles 11,600 leukocytes with 78.5% segmented, 13.4% lymphocytes and 7.2% monocytes, in addition to normal biomarkers.
The electrocardiogram showed previously known left bundle branch block.
The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and the chest tomography showed diffuse interstitial thickening on "disluctant glass" images (crazy paving pattern).
The findings suggestive of interstitial pneumonitis were not initiated antibiotic therapy.
The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ventricular dilatation with severe systolic dysfunction, which led to Cardiology.
A coronary angiography showed severe lesions in the distal anterior descending artery, proximal circumflex and marginal acute, which did not justify the myocardial dysfunction.
Cardioresonance was performed one month after the onset of symptoms and showed anterolateral hyperintensity with late subepicardial enhancement, left ventricular dilation and 13%, consistent with subacute LVEF
IgM and IgG anti-CMV antibodies and PCR anti-CMV were positive, so treatment with valganvir oral was started for two weeks.
She presented stable dyspnea at baseline NYHA class II and LVEF of 45% according to control echocardiography.
