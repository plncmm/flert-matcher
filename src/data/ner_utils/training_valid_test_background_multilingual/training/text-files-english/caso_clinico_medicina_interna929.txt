A 49-year-old patient who was a parental drug user with a history of chronic HCV liver disease and indefinite anticoagulation for recurrent deep venous thrombosis was admitted to the emergency department with a one-week history of fever radiating to the right arm.
In the anamnesis he denied infectious focus and his physical examination was anodyne.
She had previously consulted for this reason and was discharged with symptomatic treatment.
Despite this, she reported clinical worsening and presented an increase in acute phase reactants, so she was admitted for study empirically covered with ceftazidime and cloxacillin.
HIV serology was negative.
However, Serra marcescens was isolated in 2/3 hemocultives, so that antibiotic treatment was initiated with cefepime subsequently changed to microbiology guided by indication of microbiogram.
An MRI was requested which described extradural C5-C6 level due to an anterior epidural abscess with signs of spondylodyscosis‚ñÅincipient and cholecystitis to C6 spinal cord compression starting C7.
For this reason, a neurosurgical assessment was requested, due to lack of interventionism, as the patient did not present a clinical picture of spinal cord compression at that time.
During hospitalization, the patient presented progressive symptomatic improvement, with less pain and referred subjective increase in strength in both arms.
The control blood cultures were sterile.
Given the good evolution, after 3 weeks of directed intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient was discharged with antibiotic and ciprofloxacin orally until completing 6 weeks of treatment.
The radiological control performed at 2 and 5 months confirmed the resolution of the abscess without signs of myelopathy.
