A 32-year-old man with no comorbidities or risk factors was admitted to our emergency department on day 14 since the onset of symptoms, with dry cough, asthenia, arthromyalgia, fever and right pleural pain.
A baseline electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, 97 l.p.m., normal PR interval (120) and normal QRS complexes), aQRS 0Â°.
QTc (Friderica) 415 ms. Echocardiogram was not performed, but initial physical examination revealed blood pressure 136/79 mmHg, regular rhythm without murmurs, distal pulse present and symmetrical deep vein thrombosis and absence of signs of signs.
Analytical tests showed high values of ferritin (615 ng/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) = 3.6 mg/dL and increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) (144.7 pg/mL).
Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) 12 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.1, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 28.2 seconds.
The test for lupus anticoagulant was positive.
Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M were also performed, with negative results.
The values of the Day Day Day were high, with 2460 ug/L and, due to the suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, a double-energy CT pulmonary angiography (CTTA) was performed.
CTEPA confirmed bilateral thromboembolism associated with multiple opacities, compatible with viral pneumonia.
Iodine map images showed peripheral pulmonary infarction.
The patient received treatment with hydroxychloroquine at an initial dose of 400 mg on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day for the following four days.
She was also administered azithromycin 500 mg/day for 3 days and enoxaparin 80 mg/12 h for 10 days.
During admission, the patient showed clinical improvement without assisted breathing and maintained oxygen saturation around 97% to 99% in room air.
On day 10 of admission, 24 days after the onset of symptoms, the patient was discharged in good health status and asymptomatic.
Given the positivity for antibodies to lopic anticoagulant, a thrombophilia test will be performed in 3 months.
A complete anticoagulant regimen was prescribed every 12 h for 6 months.
