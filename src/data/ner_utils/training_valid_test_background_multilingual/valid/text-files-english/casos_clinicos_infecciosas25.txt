Our patient was a 62-year-old man with a history of bronchial asthma and a former smoker for up to 8 years with a cumulative load of 36 pack-years.
He lived in a slum where he had dogs, cats, and birds.
She was being treated with budesonide/ formotherapy and montelukast inhalers without presenting any drug allergies.
She came to the emergency room due to a one week history of loss of strength in the left hemibody along with left hand clumsiness and altered ambulation. This clinical condition was exacerbated on the day of her emergency visit.
Deepening in the anamnesis, she reported having presented two months ago a picture of pleuritic pain in the left side, as well as cough with whitish expectoration, with no fever associated or hemoptysis at home.
She also had a weight loss of about 8Kg in the last month without any other symptoms from the digestive or urinary point.
No dental extractions were reported.
On physical examination, blood pressure was 133/75 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/min, temperature was 36.3oC, baseline oxygen saturation was 98%, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min.
He was in good general condition, conscious, oriented and alert.
On neurological examination, language was coherent without dysarthric or dysphasic features.
With PINLA, MOEC and normal confrontation campimetry.
There was no▁rigidity of the neck or meningeal signs, highlighting a decrease in strength in the left hemibody of proximal predominance, being 3/5 in the left upper limb and 4/5 in the left lower limb.
He had a mentally ill extinction in his left limbs, with a non-ataxic gait.
Examination of the oropharynx revealed the absence of several teeth and multiple caries.
In the Auscultation, cardiorrespiratory consolidation only stood out in some wheezing areas in both lung fields, with rhythmic cardiac tones and without audible murmurs.
Abdominal examination was normal and in the lower limbs only slight edemas surrounding the mucosa + / ++++ were observed, without skin lesions.
Among the complementary tests performed in the emergency room were: • A blood test that highlighted a blood count with hemoglobin of 12 gr/dl with 13,200 leukocytes/or leukocytes, 2% neutrophils and 14.7% lymphocytes) and 391.000.
In biochemical tests, renal function and coagulation were within normal limits, with only a fibrinogen of 644.7 mg/dl standing out.
• A chest X-ray showed an increase in density in the left upper lobe with hilar retraction and volume loss of the lung.
• On ECG, the rhythm was sinus with a frequency of 70 bpm, with no changes in repolarization.
• Finally, a cranial CAT scan with and without intravenous contrast was performed in the emergency room, showing a right frontoparietal lesion with associated edema and ring contrast uptake.
Differential diagnosis In the differential diagnosis of brain lesions that capture ring contrast, the following causes should be considered: Neoplasms • Primary or CNS (supratentorial, CNS): Glioblastomas.
• Secondary: Metastases, especially in this patient the pulmonary origin, being a former smoker and the possibility of underlying tumor mass causing atelectasis in the chest X-ray.
Other malignancies to consider would be melanoma, gastrointestinal cancer or renal carcinoma.
Infections • Abscess of the brain due to contiguity or dissemination of the pathogen (endocarditis, pulmonary...).
• Toxoplasmosis common (common) in immunocompromised patients. After the findings in the emergency department, with established neurological symptoms and the lesion observed in the CT scan, we decided to be admitted to the Neurosurgery Department for study.
On the day after admission, a high signal intensity scan was performed with a low sequence located in the posterior lobe of the LLE, where "a rounded 2 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm signal intensity lesion▁surrounded by a semi-circumscribed T2 center edema was described.
The lesion presents diffusion restriction and a pattern of metabolites in the spectroscopy study, in which the presence of a large lactic acid peak and slight choline elevation is highlighted.
The perfusion study showed no findings suggesting the presence of neoformative▁angiogenesis.
After the administration of IVC there is intense enhancement of its wall, with certain irregularities clearly delimiting.
No other areas of pathological intracranial enhancement were observed.
The findings described, except for irregularities of the wall, suggest a probable brain abscess."
After these findings a drainage of the lesion by stereotactic puncture was performed, whose material was sent to microbiology for culture and empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with Vancomycin at a dose of 1.5gr every 12 hours iv.
, Metronidazole 500 mg q12h iv and cefoxime 2gr/8h iv.
On the second day the patient's stay in the plant had a fever peak of 38.2oC. Venous hemocultives were extracted and the study was extended waiting for the results of the drainage, requesting a pelvic analytic TAC-ab
In the general analysis, only a 9 mm ESR stood out, with 17,700 leukocytes/uL, 9 PMN and CRP of 0.6 mg/dl.
Tumor markers (CEA 1.2, AFP 1.7, Ca 125, Ca 72.4, Ca 19.9, NSE, PSA and S100) were normal.
Echocardiography showed no signs of endocarditis, and the TAC-absent-pelvic was reported as "lesion affecting the left upper lobe with an alveolar pattern and the presence of bronchial tree areas of necrosis and communication with the inside.
Pleural involvement and component aphasic.
Small lymph nodes in the upper▁mediastinum, pulmonary window and right paratracheal are observed.
No significant changes were observed in the abdominal area except for left inguinal hernia.
Conclusion: the thoracic lesion must have an inflammatory / infectious etiology not being able to radically rule out the possibility of tumor pathology" After the beginning of antibiotic treatment was remitting the neurological clinic with a supratentorial NMR left size, which was also shown to reduce the abscess.
Microbiological results were received, growing in the culture of brain abscess Streptococcus intermedius sensitive to penicillin (CMI minor 0.064), cefoxime and dactin sensitive (CMIpt 0.064), vancomycin (CMI. a
The venous blood culture was negative.
A chest CT scan showed that the alveolar occupation described was almost complete, with fibrotic or destructive atelectasis in the left upper lobe with bronchiectasis.
Final diagnosis Cerebral abscesses due to Streptococcus intermedius secondary to cavitated pneumonia.
