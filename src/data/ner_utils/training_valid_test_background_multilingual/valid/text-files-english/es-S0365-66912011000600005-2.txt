A 37-year-old male, ex-addict to parenteral drugs, diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 4 with low viral load (75,754 IU/ml).
Treatment was established with pegylated IFN alpha-2b (100μg/week) and ribavirin (1g/day).
Two months after the beginning of the treatment, the patient came to the clinic and complained of blurred vision and spots in the visual field for approximately 10 days.
The exploration revealed a VA of 0.8 in both eyes and multiple cotton swabs in the posterior pole.
IFN failure was diagnosed and treatment was discontinued.
In successive controls the condition improved and after 3 months she had a VA of 10/10 in both eyes and in the FO only a cotton▁exudate in resorption lower than the left fovea was observed.
