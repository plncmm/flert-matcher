A 36-year-old woman, from Los Ralos, Tucumán, northwestern province of Argentina, with HIV infection history 2002, without antiretroviral therapy (chronic immunoassay), hepatitis A virus (HAI), and positive controls for Chagas disease.
He was admitted to the Hospital de Enfermedades Infeccisos Francisco J. Muñiz de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires for an acute convulsive syndrome.
Physical examination revealed left brachio-crural and right central facial paresis, ataxia, dysmetria and nystagmus.
Laboratory tests at admission showed a complete blood count with HBcAg, normal hemoglobin, 13.5 g/dl, leukocytes 3,200/mm3, platelets 155,000/mm, HVHD 40 mm/h, GOT 187 UHB.
CD4+ TL count was 79 cells/μL3 (8%).
Chest radiography, ECG and echocardiogram were normal.
Contrast-enhanced brain MRI showed an extensive hyperintense signal area in FLAIR, T2 and diffusion with discrete mass effect and some sectors of pathological signal predominance after injecting the frontal subcortical contrast with the left side of the brain mass.
Axial MRI T1 Flair with gadolinium showed heterogeneous nodular formations that were reinforced with intravenous contrast in the right posterior fossa and left lateral frontal lobe.
Lumbar puncture was performed with opening pressure of 12 cm H2O, obtaining a CSF bacteria, colourless proteins, glucose 78 mg/dl, glucose 78 mg/dl, bacteriological direct and mycological culture negative (10%).
Molecular studies (PRC) for HSV-1 and 2, VZV, CMV, VHH-6 and EBV were negative.
A Strout microheal was performed on two occasions, without observing the signs.
The serology for toxoplasmosis positive (Ig positive 1/64 and IgM negative by IFI), for which empirical treatment was initiated as cerebral toxoplasmosis with usual pyrimony treatment and mental retardation.
The patient presented clinical progression of cerebellar syndrome after two weeks of treatment, so she added benidazole 300 mg daily for assuming a probable reactivation of an infection.
A PCR for Chagas was performed in plasma and CSF, and the plasma sample was positive.
The patient was admitted with improvement of the clinical picture and lesions observed in the images.
Contrast-enhanced brain MRI was performed 35 days after the initiation of antichagasic treatment, which showed a significant reduction in the lesions, with which it was decided to hospital discharge and outpatient follow-up.
After 15 days of treatment with continued benzathidazole treatment, she presented with a platelet count increase and hepatic transaminase elevation, which led to nifurtimox 240 mg daily.
Eleven days after the last treatment, the patient developed peripheral neuropathy, so beneidazole was restarted.
The patient did not comply with the clinical controls, and one week after starting treatment with▁benzydazol again, she was admitted to hospital with fever and pancitretin.
The patient presented with a clinical picture of multiorgan failure of septic etiology and died 24 hours after admission.
