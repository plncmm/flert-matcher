A 67-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a two-day history of fever, chills and low back pain with mechanical characteristics not irradiating to the lower limbs.
His personal history included hypertension treated with candesartán, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with severe acenocoumarol, sigmoidosis and placement of St Jude prosthesis 5 years earlier.
In the general physical examination, no significant alterations were observed, nor were there neurological deficits.
The patient lived in rural areas and lived with several domestic animals, although in the directed interview he reported not having received any bite or scratch previously.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis with left shift (15,100 leukocytes/mm3, 11,630 neutrophils/mm3, 1,060 fallers/mm3).
Fresh examination of the hemocultives showed▁cocci and these were stained negative in Gram stain.
Hemocultives were identified in blood agar plates, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar, and the first two growth plates were obtained in▁greyish colonies, but not in hemolytic colonies.
Biochemical tests performed with the API2ONE system (Biomérieux) resulted in the identification of Pasteurella pneumotropica (P. pneumotropica), confirmed in the National Microbiology Center.
Oxidase, catalase, indole and urease reactions were positive, produced decarboxylation of ornithine, acidification of xylose, maltose and sucrose, and reduced nitrates to
The microorganism was sensitive to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 8),sporins (kephalotin ≤ 8, cefoxime ≤ 4, Cefuroxime ≤ 1),≤ amino cephaloprim-tissue cephalometholicine ( 2/profloxacinmethoprimmethoprim).
MRI of the lumbar spine showed an anterior epidural abscess at L4-L5 level, with involvement of the left psoas-iliac muscle, as well as of the inferior vena cava S1.
Treatment with ciprofloxacin was initiated for 4 weeks, intravenously during the first week (400mg/12 hours), followed by oral medication (mg/12 hours).
Surgical or percutaneous drainage of the abscesses was not necessary.
The clinical course was favorable with complete resolution of symptoms, and a subsequent MRI performed 6 weeks later confirmed the resolution of the abscesses previously described.
