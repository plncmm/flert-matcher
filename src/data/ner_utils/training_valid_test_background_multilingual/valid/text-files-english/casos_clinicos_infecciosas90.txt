We report the case of a 37-year-old man, a worker of a cooperative Frequenard, with immigrants, without known drug allergies or toxic habits.
His antecedents included episodes of hemicraneal intermittent headache of more than ten years of evolution.
She did not report risky sexual relations.
She was seen in the emergency department with severe holocraneal headache and instability on walking for four days.
In the directed anamnesis she referred fever and vomiting of non-food content the night before (three times), intermittent paresthesias in both hands of three days of evolution and cold symptoms week with cough and sputum.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented.
He collaborated, although he was suffering from mental illness.
Glasgow 15/15.
Eupneic and without increased work of breathing.
Blood pressure was 120/63 mmHg, heart rate was 52 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing in room air.
She was afflicted.
Upon cardiopulmonary auscultation, heart sounds were rhythmic and without audible murmurs; vesicular murmur was preserved.
The abdomen was blushing and depressible, and there were no masses or enlargements.
No skin lesions were observed.
Neurological examination revealed pain upon passive neck mobilization, without▁rigidity, paresis of the sixth right pair, and gait ataxia with a fall to the right.
Urgent laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 14.4 g/dL; leukocytes 11.240/mm3 with 84% segmented; PCR 44.5 mg/L; urine sediment showed no infection data and antigenionuria for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no changes in QRS or repolarization.
The chest X-ray was normal and the non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head did not reveal any pathological findings.
Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) extraction at a pressure of 28 cm of H2O of cloudy appearance.
CSF analysis revealed 1649 leukocytes; 88% polymorphonuclear; 12% monocytes; 35 mg/dL glucose (glycemia 130mg/dL); 189.3 mg/dL adenocrine proteins; 14.7A/L positive
Gram stain was negative.
Bacterial antigens of N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were requested in CSF and samples were sent for culture.
Given the clinical and biochemical suspicion of CSF compatible with bacterial meningitis, samples were taken for hemocultive and empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 2 g/12h intravenous (i.v.) and vancomycin 1 g was started.
High CSF pressure and clinical manifestations of ataxia and paresis of the LV pair were associated with ampicillin 2 g/4 h.v.
Treatment to cover cough as a possible causative organism.
We requested HIV serology from the emergency department that was negative; serology of the lesions, tuberculin skin test (PPD or Mantoux) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
differential diagnosis between hyperproteinia and acute meningoencephalitis patient and Gram stain negativity and CSF antigens include differential diagnosis of glucose-induced processes that may be associated with meningeal neutrophilic involvement.
• Acute bacterial meningitis: The most common cause in adults of all ages is Streptococcus pneumoniae.
In young adults, Neisseria meningitidis is followed in frequency.
In our patient, the cloudy appearance of CSF, the presence of more than 1,000 leukocytes with a percentage of neutrophils of 83%, and glucose consumption suggest a high suspicion of bacterial meningitis.
However, although neck pain and severe headache are common manifestations, acute bacterial meningitis rarely courses at normal temperature.
In addition, the negativity of Gram staining and bacterial antigens of N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the CSF of the patient should make us doubtful whether these three clinical microorganisms are responsible for the patient.
The involvement of the VI pair and the ataxia clinic led us to think of Lis gravis as it is frequent that it courses with focal neurological manifestations and involvement of the romboencef.
However, it usually affects neonates, the elderly or immunocompromised patients.
In our case, the patient was a healthy young male with no factors that could compromise his immune system, including negative HIV serology.
On the other hand, no gram-positive bacilli were identified in CSF.
• Syphilitic meningitis: After primary infection, Treponema padillum can spread to the central nervous system and cause meningitis with manifestations similar to acute bacterial meningitis, with frequent involvement of the optic, auditory and facial nerves.
It usually occurs in secondary syphilis accompanied by other peripheral manifestations such as skin rash.
Lymphocyte pleocytosis and high protein concentration can be found in CSF.
Blood glucose levels are usually decreased.
Our patient did not report any risky sexual relations or previous history of syphilis.
There were no skin lesions suggestive of secondary syphilis.
CSF analysis showed high levels of proteins and glucose consumption, characteristics that are shared with syphilitic meningitis.
However, what stood out in the CSF analysis was the predominance of neutrophils that would go against this diagnosis.
Treponemic tests in CSF are in most cases positive in syphilitic meningitis, although, given the low clinical suspicion, they were not requested at first.
We do request serology of Treponema padillum in plasma to rule out this entity.
• Viral encephalitis and viral meningitis: Behavioral disturbance, sensory and motor deficit, as well as personality changes are frequent alterations of encephalitis.
However, it is common to find patients with parenchymal and meningeal involvement.
In both processes, CSF characteristics are similar; normal glucose levels; high protein concentration; high leukocytes with predominance of neutrophils in early phases, and lymphocytes in more advanced phases.
Glucose levels are usually normal.
The most common cause of viral meningitis is enterovirus.
Other responsible viruses are HIV, West Nile Virus (WNV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), mumps virus and▁lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM).
A common cause of sporadic encephalitis is herpes simplex virus type 1.
Although the clinical diagnosis of meningoencephalitis is compromised in our patient, it could fit the diagnosis of viral meningoencephalitis, the characteristics of CSF with neutrophilic pleocytosis and consumption of glucose.
• Tuberculous meningitis:▁Sensory manifestations appear in the course of the disease; headache and personality changes are common in early stages, while meningeal positive signs and motor or late deficits are common in early stages.
In the final phases, multiple nerves can be affected and cause major neurological deficits, including coma.
It usually affects adults with some type of impairment caused by reactivation of chronic forms and dissemination of pathogens.
The CSF usually shows mononuclear pleocytosis, although sometimes the cellular reaction is characterized by early stages predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Protein levels are usually high, and glucose levels are decreased.
The measurement of ADA in CSF is useful in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis although high concentrations can be found in some bacterial infections2.
In our case, the patient is a young, healthy patient with negative HIV serology in the emergency room, although with an epidemiological context (worker with immigrants) that could have caused the infection.
The clinical manifestations of the patient, together with the characteristics of CSF with glucose consumption, relatively high levels of ADA and increased protein, could guide this entity.
Although neutrophilic pleocytosis in CSF is not common in tuberculous meningitis, this diagnosis cannot be ruled out.
• Cryptococcus Meningoencephalitis: It usually affects immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection, treated with glucocorticoids or other drugs.
In most cases, it manifests as a subacute meningoencephalitis, and it is often without fever.
CSF outflow pressure is usually high and CSF analysis usually shows increased leukocytes with predominance of monocytes, glucose consumption and high proteins.
It is currently possible to detect cryptococcal antigen in CSF and serum early3, although the definitive diagnosis is made by culture of CSF.
In our patient, the HIV serology was negative, and in principle did not present any factor that could be compromising his immune system.
However, in the literature there are cases reported of patients with meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans without any apparent risk factor.
The clinical manifestations of meningitis unaffected by fever, increased CSF outflow pressure, and CSF analysis with high glucose and protein intake led us to include this entity.
After three days of empirical treatment, the patient did not experience any improvement.
She presented repeated episodes of agitation and confusion, and diplopia appeared as a new clinical manifestation.
Due to the lack of response to treatment and the negativity of bacterial antigens in CSF, as well as bacterial cultures (pathologic culture and CSF) at 72 hours, it was decided to withdraw vancomycin from treatment.
The PPD was negative at 48 hours and a small focus of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity was observed on the MRI of the skull, with a doubtful focal area of enhancement associated with encephalitis, which was reported as a compatible focus.
Having these findings, and waiting for CSF cultures, we added the possibility of becoming infected with the treatment.
The serology of you was negative.
On the third day of admission, Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in CSF culture. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B 350 mg/24h i.v. and flucytosine 2 g/6h i.v.
Antibacterial and antiviral treatment was suspended.
Arrived at this point, and in search of any factor that could be compromising the immune system of our patient, we requested new HIV serology, HIV viral load and study of lymphocyte subpopulations.
The patient was successfully treated with antifungal therapy.
However, it was necessary to perform two evacuating LP in the first and second week of admission to maintain CSF outflow pressure below 20 cm H2O.
A follow-up MRI performed in the second week of admission showed a focus of hyperintensity in the left thalamus consistent with cryptoma.
2 weeks later, although the CSF antigen of Cryptococcus and the control CSF culture after 15 days were negative, it was decided to extend the usual phase of induction with liposomal amphotericin B
As an adverse effect of liposomal amphotericin B, the patient had asymptomatic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia that were corrected with good control.
While HIV serology was negative again and the HIV viral load was undetectable, the CD4 lymphocyte count was 162 x/ microL with a percentage of 19% of the total lymphocytes.
These data led us to think of the deficit of CD4+ lymphocytes in the idiopathic region (ICL) as an entity responsible for the▁lymphopenia of our patient.
After completing the induction phase of treatment (4 weeks) and aiming to reduce the size of oral cryptomas during the 10-week follow-up period, the patient was discharged with fluconazole at 800 h after 24 h of consolidation with oral fluconazole.
Sepsis. CD4+ lymphocyte deficiency, after good control of potassium levels was achieved, prophylaxis for pneumonia due to cystis was initiated in jirovecii with▁assured harmtoxazol/trimeto days 160prim/800
Primary immunodeficiencies were studied on an outpatient basis.
Two months after discharge, the CD4+ lymphocyte count persisted below 300 leukocytes per centimeter AUC, representing less than 20% of the total lymphocyte count.
Decreased levels of B cells were also observed in the study of lymphocyte subpopulations.
The levels of complement and immunoglobulins and their sub-items were normal.
▁Definitive diagnosis Meningoencephalitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans complicated with cryptoencephalitis located in the left thalamus.
Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocyte deficiency as the underlying cause of immunosuppression.
