The case is discussed with the Hematology Service the option of performing a bone marrow aspirate considering the non-indication currently given the absence of clinical, analytical and imaging data suggesting a hematological process in case of persistent bone marrow culture.
On the third day of admission, the patient experienced absence of fever despite a decrease in the corticosteroid regimen instituted on an outpatient basis.
The patient was discharged with oral anticoagulation (Sintrom), treatment with H. pilory and subsequent follow-up in the consultation.
