Consultation: Vomiting and arthromyalgia.
Family history: no interest.
Personal history: No drug allergies.
The patient was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and treated with weekly methotrexate and folic acid, and exceptionally with lornoxicam.
Primary antiphospholipid syndrome, without follow-up or treatment.
Current disease A 38-year-old patient came to the emergency department complaining of a 72-hour history of general▁malaise, generalized arthromyalgia (predominantly in lower limbs), back pain radiating to the cervical level, with paresthesia.
It was accompanied by vomiting (without blood, pus, or pathological remains), which had exacerbated within the last 24 hours to a number greater than 10, with intolerance to intake.
No headache, no fever.
No changes in bowel habits or abdominal pain.
It was also associated with mild dry cough with whitish nasal mucus, without dyspnea, and without other symptoms.
Neurological examination at admission showed negative meningeal signs, without neck stiffness.
They did not▁appreciate alterations in the cranial nerves, tone, strength, sensitivity or reflexes.
No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia were observed.
No language alterations were described, although they described a gait.
Examination (ACP, abdomen and limbs) showed no relevant data.
Then, she was assessed by an Internist of the daycare center, who admitted the patient for study, and she was treated with Methylprednisolone, enantyum and pantoprazole because vomiting was already scarce.
▁Complementary laboratory tests performed in the emergency department: blood count: Hb 12.7g/dl.
Hct 39.3%.
Leukocytes 8,100/dl (PMN 73.9%, Lymphocytes 23.1%).
Platelets 340,000.
Coagulation: high fibrinogen; normal rest.
Biochemistry: PCR 0.25.
Normal renal function and renal function.
Hepatic enzymes, amylase, bilirubin, and AF within normal limits.
Imaging tests: X-ray of the chest, abdomen, and cervical and lumbar spine: no relevant data.
ECG: Sinus rhythm was normal, with no repolarization disorders.
The patient was admitted 36 hours after admission with severe generalized muscle weakness, dysneic sensation and inability to swallow (action causing cough and vomiting) and urinary incontinence.
At that time, the examination revealed intolerance to the supine position, evident generalized muscle weakness (which made it impossible for the patient to move in bed), without pseudding and bladder balloon.
Saturation was 99% and the rest of the constants were within normal limits.
Analytically, hyponatremia was evident ( 122 mEq/l) and hypokalemia with no other relevant data.
In a few hours, the patient developed acute respiratory failure requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
On physical examination, a few reactive light middle pupils were striking, with a conserved direct and consensual photomotor pattern.
Spontaneous upward nitagmoid movements and spontaneous flutterpectoral movements.
Abolitioned nauseous and thy present.
Universal hipotony, consolidation, tetraplegia, universal areflexia and bilateral flexor CPR.
When we found ourselves with a syndromic acute sensory motor polyneuropathy, possible SIADH, and ventilatory failure, we decided to make the differential diagnosis with (see table).
A non-contrast-enhanced cranial CAT scan (no abnormalities) was requested, and a lumbar puncture was subsequently performed, requesting a large study of CSF anti-tuberculosis drug, anti-tuberculosis drug, anti-tuberculosis drug smodium, anti-smodium, anti-tuberculosis drugs, anti-smodium, anti-tuberculosis drugs, anti-smockle
The following bactericides were added to the study: Seresina: · In blood: ANA, AntiDNA Ac, ENAs, ANCAs, Anti-Multrasound Acid Shingella, AcjunoneurHS
psittaci andSG, coxiella burns - folic acid, mycoplasma pneumoniae, thyroiditis profile, acid stridium and folic acid, immunoglobulin, IA, HCV and HIV, protein-trypsin profile,
• In urine: heavy metals in urine (mercury, lead and arsenic), total porphyrins in urine.
• Albumin-cythological (clear fluid, colorless) biochemical determination was detected in CSF.
Leukocytes 7, mononuclear 100%, leukocytes 15 with spiculated appearance, glucose 55 mg/dl, proteins 125.7 mg/dl, ADA U/immunoglobulinL), and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins was initiated.
Subsequently, contrast-enhanced MRI (no abnormalities) and ENG/EMG reported as signs of sensory-motor polyneuropathy, predominantly sensory, axonal and distal demyelinating with predominantly involvement of the upper and lower extremities.
Moderate injury, which does not fit into the typical pattern of Guillain-Association syndrome.
The results of the rest of the tests performed in blood, CSF and urine were negative or within normal limits, except for positive CSF Tropheryma Whipple PCR.
After the described findings, Whipple's disease was diagnosed with neurological symptoms as a form of presentation, in addition to joint involvement.
Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was started.
