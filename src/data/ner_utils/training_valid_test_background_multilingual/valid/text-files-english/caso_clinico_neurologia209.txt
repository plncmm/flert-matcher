A 57-year-old male was followed for one year for hypoesthesia of the hands and feet, which began the previous year.
Dyslipidemic and severe exenolism up to 5 years ago.
In the anamnesis, he denied family history of interest.
The patient came to consultation due to painless burns in the hands, with hypoesthesia of distribution in fingers 2 and 3 of the right hand and finger 5 left, with a subsequent rapidly progressive worsening of the soft lime affected hands.
These symptoms were accompanied by distal motor clumsiness in the hands.
He had been injured distally in his extremities without realizing it, and had even been sutured without need of anesthesia.
She presented symptoms suggestive of dysautonomia, as well as systemic or constitutional symptoms.
Systemic sclerosis normal.
There were no dermal or mucosal lesions.
There were no joint deformities or thickening of the nerve trunks.
In the initial neurological examination, the upper mental functions were preserved.
Language was normal.
The cranial nerves were normal.
In the muscular balance there was a slight paresis (4/5) of the short fixation of the first finger of the right hand and of the first dorsal interosseous of the left hand, without fasciculations.
In the exploration, the patient presented hypoesthesia in the upper limbs (MMSS), more marked at the level of the median nerve territory in the right hand and cubital in the left.
In the lower limbs it affected the knees with total distal anesthesia.
There was no decrease in vibratory sensitivity.
The patient had marked distal anhidrosis, with trophic disorders such as hair loss.
Walking was normal, Romberg negative.
Located osteotendinous remains with indifferent cutaneous-plantar reflex.
A new exploration revealed a more diffuse distribution of hypoesthesia at the level, as well as a more marked hypotrophy with ulnar hypotrophy associated with the right hand first distal prominence of the shorthand of the hand 5 months later.
These findings were indicative of a multineuritis.
▁Complementary tests • Blood analysis: normal blood count, biochemistry and coagulation.
HDL and LDL-cholesterol were normal.
Thyroid function and tumor markers were normal.
Autoimmune study with ANA, C-ANCA, P-ANCA and anti-Ro negative.
Anti-Glaucopenia component (anti-GM1 and GQ1b IgG) negative.
Negative immunoglobulins.
Immunoglobulins and normal proteinogram.
Immunoelectrophoresis was normal.
Normal RCT.
• Negative serology for HIV, HBV, HCV and Borrellia.
• CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: normal.
• Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and skull: no remarkable findings.
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study: normal cytochemical, non-disordered to albuminocytological.
▁Cytology, bacterial culture and PCR negative virus.
• Analytics of alpha-agonistic activity study A normal (fabry disease negative study).
• Serial electroneurography and electromyography (EMG/ENG): - Initial findings consistent with sensory-motor neuropathy, mainly severe demyelinating but also axonal neuropathy.
Predischarge in upper limbs, asymmetrical and with high chronology, increased latency and conduction velocities, decreased motor potential amplitude (MPMPMP) and almost invocable
Electroneurography with medium motor potential with high chronology, increased latency and decreased amplitude.
- Change in the pattern of involvement successively EMG/ENG: disappearance of sensory potentials (NR).
Severe responses in CMPA amplitudes persisting with a high chronology of distal latencies.
Patched affection, since some nerves such as the right radial or left motor peroneal had normal values, a finding suggestive of a multineuritis.
EMG with reduced neurogenic pattern.
- Sweat biopsy: severe neuropathy evolved with complete loss of all fibers, inflammation and presence of intracellular bacilli with Fite positive staining compatible with lepromatous leprosy.
Sural nerve biopsy: numerous Fite positive bacilli are observed.
Diagnosis Multineuritis infectious by Mycobacterium leprae.
Treatment Specific treatment was initiated with rifampicin, dapsone and clomiphene.
Epicardial effusion was diagnosed initially as idiopathic neuropathy.
and oral corticosteroids, with no improvement.
The symptoms continued to progress and ulcerative lesions developed in the feet.
