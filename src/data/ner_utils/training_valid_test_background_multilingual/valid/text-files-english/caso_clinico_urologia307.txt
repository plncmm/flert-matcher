Anamnesis A 51-year-old male was referred from his health center to the▁Pneumology Department of the hospital in March 2011 due to the finding of a right pleural effusion on chest X-ray.
As a personal history, the patient has only subclinical hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine.
She had no history of surgery or urology.
The patient presents a clinical picture of dyspnea that progressed for 5 months and progressed to mild exertion.
The patient also reported as additional symptoms asthenia and anorexia for two weeks.
Physical examination revealed that the patient was in good general condition, was conscious and oriented towards the signs.
No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac auscultation revealed rales, no murmurs.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed decreased vesicular murmur at the right lung base.
The abdomen is blushing and depressible for fixation, non-painful, without mass or enlargement.
The presence of varices in the right lower limb is noteworthy in the lower limbs.
• Blood tests and electrocardiograms do not show any abnormalities.
• An abdominal ultrasound is performed, which shows the existence of a solid tumor in the upper pole of the right kidney about 7 cm in diameter that is associated with tumor thrombosis of the right renal vein and thrombosis with dilation of the vena cavac
• To further refine the study, a computed tomography (CT) was requested, confirming the presence of the mass in the upper pole of the right kidney, with venous involvement of the right renal vein and inferior vena cavaur until entry.
In addition, it has been shown that tumor thrombosis extends to suprahepatic veins.
• With the objective of completing the study from the point of view of venous involvement, a transesophageal echocardiogram is performed first, which shows the presence of a tumor thrombus in the left second hepatic vein magnetic resonance, confirming both the presence of a tumor thrombus in the right atrium.
Treatment With the diagnosis of right renal carcinoma with venous involvement, it was decided to perform radical surgery, which is carried out jointly between the Services of General Surgery, Cardiac Surgery and Urology.
Under general anesthesia, a transverse laparotomy and a medial laparotomy were performed.
The extensive involvement already known was confirmed and a fibrotic congestive liver with smooth edges and no areas of ischemia was observed.
An intraoperative ultrasound was performed, confirming the patency of the middle and left suprahepatic veins.
A right nephrectomy was performed with ligation of two arteries in the interaortocaval groove and a wide cavotomy with resection of part of the wall of the vena cava, being necessary a pericardium graft.
Subsequently, extracorporeal circulation was performed with cannulation of the superior vena cava and the right femoral vein with arterial return to the ascending aorta artery. Subsequently, a right atriotomy and removal of the tumor thrombus were performed.
After this maneuver, a decrease in hepatic congestion was observed.
There is an incoercible venous hemorrhage in the hepatocaval ligament and retroperitoneum, reason why it is decided to place packing at these levels.
Intraoperatively, the patient presents significant hemodynamic instability in relation to hemorrhagic shock requiring maximum doses of vasoconstrictors, massive transfusion of blood products and administration of factor VIIr.
Forty-eight hours after the first surgery, a surgical revision for depacking is performed.
During the postoperative period, the patient presents a series of complications: acute renal failure of Klebsiella pneumoniae periodica, radiological alterations that are recovered with serum therapy and high doses of diuretics; lethargy and severe hypotonia secondary to bacterial encephalopathy of mixed liver transfusion (metab crisis).
36 were treated with antibiotics and surgery was discouraged due to the patient's general condition; bacteremia due to Enterococcus faecium; cardiorespiratory failure due to postoperative septic shock 27; surgery was also rejected due to poor clinical situation 36.
Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma of the collecting ducts of Bellini with invasion of the inferior vena cava (pT3cN0M0).
Three months later, the patient's father in the case described above was diagnosed with right renal neoplasia with muscle invasion and lung, liver and bone metastases.
Due to the extensive involvement at the time of diagnosis, it was decided to maintain an attitude and the patient died two months after diagnosis.
Necropsy revealed a renal carcinoma of collecting ducts of multiple Bellini that isolated perirenal fatb, renal pelvis, upper third of the ureter, renal veins 21 and inferior vena cavaM1.
Due to this finding, we studied the rest of family members: in the studies conducted with siblings of the clinical case (two brothers and one sister), no change was found from the urological point of view.
On the other hand, the noncompliance principle is observed in the presence of piloleiomyomas in the patients sister under follow-up by pathology, and in the patients siblings (diagnosed due to rejection).
These findings led us to suspect heredo-familial renal cancer syndrome.
The first suspicion is hereditary leiomyomatosis syndrome and renal cell carcinoma, a disease in which there is a mutation of the fumarate hydratase gene.
Currently, the patient's sister in our clinical case is awaiting the result of genetic screening that reveals this eventual mutation.
