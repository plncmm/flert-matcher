A 20-year-old male, with no relevant medical history, born and living in Loreto, Amazon region of Peru.
He reported that nine months ago he presented petechial, erythematous, circular, pruritic, well-defined edge lesions located in the plantar region associated with pruritus, which was later generally observed.
Three months later, the military service began in Lima, where pruritus exacerbated and the number of lesions in upper and lower limbs increased.
Four months later, general▁malaise and intermittent fever were added up to 40°C.
He came to a health facility in Rac, Lima where metmizole was administered intramuscularly.
He continued on this medication for two months; however, due to the non-remission of fever and the progression of the lesions he consulted in our hospital.
The patient was admitted in stable general conditions.
Physical examination revealed maculopapular, erythematous, circular, confluent lesions, with well-defined borders, red wine-colored, palpable and that did not disappear at digital pressure.
They had an approximate size of 0.3 x 0.3 cm each, located in the upper and lower limbs, trunk, abdomen and periumbilical region, which caused intense pruritus.
No gastrointestinal symptoms.
Blood count showed 50% hypereosinophilia (absolute▁eosinophils: 6,480 cells/mm3), with normal leukocytes and lymphocytes.
The diagnosis of vascular purpura and nonspecific parasitosis was made.
A serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) of 609.8 IU/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.63 mg/L was obtained, and serological viral tests (HIV, HTLV-1, HCV, HBsAg) were negative
Symptomatic treatment with i.v. chlorphenamine was started.
A parasitological examination of feces was carried out, revealing stercoralis stercoralis larvae.
The initial treatment was conservative 200 μg/kg/day for two days.
In addition, cysts of Entamo coli and Iodamoeba bustchilli were identified, so I received albendazole 400 mg once a day for seven days.
Subsequently, the patient was placed in a position i.e., 200 ug/kg/day for two more days, seven days after the first dose.
After 15 days of treatment initiation, the number of skin lesions decreased significantly, although they maintained a punctiform pattern in the lower limbs and back.
Therefore, topical methylprednisolone aceponate was added.
In addition, during this period, a skin biopsy was obtained which identified a▁lymphocytic infiltrate without larval identification.
As regards control tests, on the seventh day of treatment, eosinophil levels decreased to 24% (1,685 IU cé/mm3) and at 15 days decreased to 9% (64561 IU c IgE/mm3), respectively.
One month after treatment, cutaneous manifestations were rare.
A serial parasitological examination in control feces was observed Hymenolepis nana, so she received albendazole 400 mg daily for five days, prazicuantel 25 mg/kg in a single dose and nitazo.
IgE levels in a third control were 357.6 IU/mL.
At the end of the treatment, a new serial parasitological examination was performed, not identifying▁parasites.
Finally, after two and a half months of treatment, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of reactivated purpura due to stercoralis resolved.
