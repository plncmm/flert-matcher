A 51-year-old patient, with no relevant past medical history, began progressively in recent days with decay, instability and dysarthria.
An urgent CT scan showed a left thalamus lesion with perilesional edema.
Clinical and analytical data were reviewed, observing only mild neutrophilia and a complete MRI study was performed.
MRI showed thalamic lesion with irregular contours with contrast uptake in ring and important diffusion restriction, suggesting the diagnosis of intracranial abscess.
The absence of infectious symptoms, the analysis almost anodyne and the fact that the patient was immunocompetent with no history of brain surgery made clinicians doubt the diagnosis, orienting more towards tumor lesion.
Antibiotic treatment was self-administered and two days later CT was repeated, showing a significant increase in size.
The patient was operated on and the presence of purulent material was confirmed, with negative result of AP and the origin was not found.
