PRESENT ANTECTION, PRESENTATION AND EXPLORT A 27-year-old male from Ukraine is presented.
He was assessed in his country for long PR in 2012, with RP 260 ms, with sinus bradycardia at 52 bpm at rest.
With normal echocardiogram, without structural alterations.
Do not take your regular medication.
There is no family history of cardiac diseases or sudden death.
He often does sports.
Feeling sick for more than a year, feeling dizzy occasionally and instability fundamentally after exercise, without loss of consciousness.
About 5 years ago, a syncopal episode in Ukraine, in the context of fever of more than 40°C, refers to being aware that it loses consciousness without trauma, reports that it may have to confirm it.
In the following years, she has not had any syncope or presyncopal episode, even having had other febrile processes.
A few months ago he consulted in PCP and was referred to the area's cardiologist for bradycardia.
An ECG showed complete AV block with an escape rhythm at 40 bpm, narrow QRS, QTc 490 ms, and was referred to the emergency room for admission and study.
Physical location: AT 139/60 mmHg; HR 45 bpm; SatO2 100 % basal.
Eupneic.
No IY.
CA: rhythmic cardiac tones, without audible pathological murmurs.
PA: bilateral normoventilation.
Abdomen: blando, depredictable, non-painful to palpation, without signs of peritoneal irritation, without enlargement.
IIS: no edema or signs of DVT.
Analytical COMPLEMENTARY PRUES: without alterations of interest.
Chest radiography: compatible with normalcy.
Autoimmunity: negative.
Serology of Borrelia Burgdorferi: negative.
Echocardiogram: compatible with normal, left ventricular non-dilated and normal LVEF.
Stress echocardiogram: to assess tachycardicization: ergometry: BRUCE protocol.
Test suspended due to physical tiredness.
No dyspnea or angina.
Conserved functional capacity: 22.2 METS.
Baseline ECG sinus rhythm at 48 bpm, with no changes in repolarization, and no changes on exertion.
Without arrhythmias from the first stage cAVB disappears, objectifying long PR with excellent tachyarization reaching a maximum HR of 181 bpm (93 % of TCCF).
Adequate post-exertion behavior.
The cAVB reappears at rest, when the HR decreases to levels below 80x".
Basal BP 130 mmHg.
▁Right behavior with effort.
Echocardiogram showed no changes in segmental▁contractility.
There were no changes in valve flows, diastolic pattern or PAP.
ID: No induction of myocardial ischemia.
Good functional capacity.
Excellent tachytherapy from the first stage of Bruce.
Electrophysiological study: basal ECG showed sinus rhythm with second degree AVB Mobitz type I.
Double puncture of the right femoral vein (introducers 5F) was performed.
Conduction intervals: HV 40 ms. Baseline and under auricular stimulation the supra-anterior origin of AV block is confirmed.
The procedure was completed without complications.
Location and conclusions: electrophysiological study compatible with suprailian AVB.
EVOLUTION Asymptomatic when admitted, denies dizziness.
No syncopal or presyncopal episodes have occurred.
The patient is monitored throughout the hospital stay, maintaining grade 2 AVB, with CF between 30 and 50 bpm, asymptomatic.
Structural heart disease was ruled out by transthoracic echocardiography.
The case is discussed with the Arrhythmias Unit and an ergometry is performed that is normal, with excellent tachycardicization with stress unit.
It was decided to carry out an electrophysiological study compatible with suprailian AVB and given the chronotropic competence, it was decided to recommend a decrease in physical activity and a review in 3 months.
DIAGNOSIS Auriculo-ventriuclar upper airway block.
