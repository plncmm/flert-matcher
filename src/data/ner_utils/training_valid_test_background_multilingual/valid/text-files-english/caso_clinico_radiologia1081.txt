A 59-year-old male patient with a 10-year history of stroke presented with cognitive impairment.
An open-group magnetic resonance imaging (Philips Outlook 0.2Ã³r3T) was performed, with sequences of right frontal vascular FLA interpreting both as subcortical lesions, and bilateral subcortical hyperintensity areas, c
In the FLAIR sequence it was possible to identify cortical hyperintensity in the temporal lobe and in the pre and post central gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, left occipital cortex and right inferior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus alterations.
Axial FLAIR.
Cortical hyperintensity in the temporal lobe and left hippocampus.
Hyperintensity in the right temporal inferior gyrus.
Axial ESF T2.
No alterations were observed.
At 15 days, the patient began with visual alterations and a rapidly progressive cognitive deterioration. Five days later, the patient was hospitalized.
The patient added pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, seizures, myoclonus, speech disorders, reaching aphasia, and also beginning with sphincter incontinence.
The electroencephalogram showed slow rhythm.
A possible diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jacob was proposed.
A new resonance imaging was performed in a high field equipment (GE Horizon LX Signa 1.5 T), adding to conventional sequences, diffusion images.
The same lesions visualized in the previous examination were observed in the FSE T2 and FLAIR sequences.
The FLAIR sequence showed cortical hyperintensity with greater involvement of the left hemisphere, temporal cortex and hippocampus, occipital cortex, left paracentral insula, bilateral hyperintensity in frontal cortex g.
The FSE T2 sequence showed mild hyperintensity in a poorly defined form.
Axial FLAIR.
Cortical hyperintensity in the left pre and post central gyrus, superior parietal and frontal bilateral and left paracentral.
Axial ESF T2.
Set up cortical hyperintensity in the left pre and post central gyrus, superior parietal and frontal bilateral and left paracentral.
Bilateral cortical lesions were clearly identified in the diffusion sequence.
Dissemination.
Marked cortical hyperintensity in left pre and postcentral gyrus, superior parietal and frontal bilateral and left paracentral.
In FLAIR, mild hyperintensity was observed in the head of both caudal nuclei, more evident in diffusion sequence, being less significant in FSE T2.
Axial FLAIR.
Cortical and head hyperintensity of both caudal nuclei.
Dissemination.
Marked cortical and head hyperintensity of both caudal nuclei.
Axial ESF T2.
Established cortical and head hyperintensity of both caudal nuclei.
During 20 days, the patient underwent electroencephalogram to a biphasic and triphasic spike-wave pattern, without reversing her clinical status.
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for 14-3-3 proteins.
The patient is considered to have a probable diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jako dypirkinamide progressive EEG and at least 2 of 4 clinical characteristics (myoclonus, visual or cerebellar signs, pyramidal signs).
Another resonance was performed in nucleus form more significant bilateral cortical lesions, both in FLAIR sequences, Diffusion, and in FSE T2 sequence, with greater bilateral hyperintensity on the head and putda.
Axial FLAIR.
diffuse cortical hyperintensity in the head of both caudal nuclei and both putamen.
Dissemination.
Diffuse cortical hyperintensity was marked on the head of both caudal nuclei and both putamen.
Axial ESF T2.
Hyperintensity in the head of caudal nuclei and putamen and mild diffuse cortical hyperintensity.
A month later, a fourth resonance imaging was performed, showing a greater increase in bilateral cortical hyperintensity in both tails and both putamen in sequences FSE T2, FLAIR and FLAIR.
The T1 sequence showed hyperintensity in both putamen.
Axial ESF T2.
Hyperintensity in the head of caudal nuclei and putamen and moderate diffuse cortical hyperintensity.
Axial FLAIR.
Marked cortical hyperintensity in caudal nuclei and putamen.
Dissemination.
Diffuse bilateral cortical hyperintensity was marked in caudal nuclei and putamen.
Third enlarged ventricle.
An important cortical defect was observed, as well as an increase in the ventricular cavities in a global and important form of both cerebellar hemispheres and vermis.
The patient died 20 days after the last MRI study.
