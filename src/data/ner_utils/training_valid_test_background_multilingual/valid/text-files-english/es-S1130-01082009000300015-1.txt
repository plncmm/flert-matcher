A 70-year-old male smoker with pulmonary emphysema was referred to our institution in May 2001 due to diarrhea, abdominal pain, general deterioration with weight loss, anemia and hypoalbuminemia.
The apex showed a▁polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon that produced stenosis preventing the passage of the endoscope.
Although the biopsies did not confirm the malignancy of the lesion, resection was performed with laterolateral colonic anastomosis.
The report of the surgical specimen was: colectomy specimen with an extensive ulcer of 6.5 cm, with raised edges that penetrated the colon wall to the pericholic fat with extensive inflammatory reaction of mucous membrane reparative inclusion level.
The diagnosis was: deep cystic colitis.
The patient improved after surgery but came to the hospital six months later due to pain and anal discharge.
A fistulous orifice in the right anal margin was observed, with no clear inflammatory but painful signs at the touch, with spontaneous exit of white fluid and an ulcer of the anal canal extending proximally.
The patient confirmed that the ulcer extended 3 cm in the rectum and had regular nodular borders.
In the colonic anastomosis, another ulcer with pseudonodular formations and large mucus formations were observed, and at 30 cm, another mucosal manifestation similar to a possible fistula orifice was observed.
Biopsies were nonspecific.
Upon admission, the patient presented with intestinal stenosis and gastroscopy showed severe distal colitis, erosive gastritis and diffuse ulceration of the mucosa of the bulbar and postbulbar duodenum.
Gastrin levels were determined as 817 pg/ml (normal value up to 100 pg/ml).
Biopsies of duodenal ulcers were also nonspecific.
Patient improved with 40 mg daily, ovate plant and analgesics.
An abdominal CT confirmed the presence of a 3 cm mass in vascularized pancreas coil-body.
Laparotomy was performed without finding pancreatic tumor, but a mass in the transverse colon was▁resected.
The histological examination was: 21 cm of transverse colon with an area with irregular mucosa and abricated appearance of 7 cm of extension, areas of linear ulceration with inflammatory infiltrate with microabscesses affecting the whole piece.
At two months the gastrin value was 529 pg/ml.
The patient remained unaffected and had new examinations and good general condition for 2 and a half years, having one or two stools a day formed with some anal incontinence, received iron due to iron deficiency anemia, 20 mg of foliage ovata
In October 2004 a segmental colitis was performed due to diarrhea. It showed that the anal margin was 15 cm from the anal margin to 35 cm, with pseudopolyps and friability that impressed ulcerative colitis.
The rectum showed no lesions.
Colon biopsies suggested active ulcerative colitis.
The patient was treated with oral tablelacin and then▁steroids from November 2004 to February 2005.
The patient was admitted several times due to worsening of his pulmonary emphysema and suffered a bilateral pneumothorax.
He was followed up only in the pulmonology department until April 2006.
