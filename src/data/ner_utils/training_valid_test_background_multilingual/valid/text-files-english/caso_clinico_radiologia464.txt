A 48-year-old woman with periumbilical abdominal pain, vomiting, fever and loss of 10 kg in one month.
She had a history of abdominoplasties and had an intrauterine device (IUD) for 10 years, without gynecological revisions.
On physical examination, the patient presented an infraumbilical mass and mucoid umbilical secretion.
Leukocytosis with left shift and elevated CRP (206.9 mg/L).
Gynecologic ultrasound showed a myoma as the only finding.
An abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed to evaluate infectious/tumor pathology and eventual puncture, identifying an anterior hypercapsule in the abdominal wall, with extension to the anterior abdominal muscles, and fat anterior hypercapsule.
He had a left parauterine lesion and ipsilateral hydronephrosis due to compression.
Microbiological study of the abdominal lesion isolated anaerobic germs (Actinomyces europaeus and radingae).
