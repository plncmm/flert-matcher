Anamnesis This is a 43-year-old male patient with a history of a germ cell tumor who underwent surgery and was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for > 20 years and hepatitis B in 2015.
The patient consults the emergency department for anal pain, constipation and hematochezia for 3 weeks.
Physical examination revealed the presence of a tumor 4 cm from the anal margin on the rectal examination.
▁Complementary tests With the suspicion of rectal neoplasia, the study concluded with a proliferative exophytic lesion, ulcerated, suggestive of rectal neoplasia, non-stenosis.
CT reports the presence of a thickening of the tumor aspect in the middle third of the rectum walls with signs of non-fatal and multiple perirectal adenopathy, as well as retroperitoneal involvement.
Magnetic resonance imaging confirms rectal parietal thickening associated with locoregional lymph node involvement.
In the histological study of rectal mass biopsy, no cells with malignant features were observed, with distorted colic mucosa and increased chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
Immunohistochemical studies for cytomegalovirus and treponema were performed, both negative.
The suspicion of infectious etiology is performed urethral and rectal swabs, with positive nucleic acids for Chlamydia trachomatis.
Diagnosis We conclude that it is a venereal▁lymphogranuloma of rectal presentation caused by C. trachomatis.
During the study of the clinical picture a blood test was performed which showed grade 4 transaminitis (AST 2497U/l-normal upper limitis 37U/l) and grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia (upper bilirubin).
Serology is performed, with IgM for hepatitis A virus positive (hepa B, hepatitis C, HIV and leucoma negative), indicating a venereal infection due to hepatitis A concomitant with▁lymphogranuloma.
Treatment Antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (100 mg every 12 hours) was initiated for 3 weeks.
Ev in later controls showed progressive normalization of the hepatic profile and disappearance of the anal clinic.
In the control group, there was an improvement in the degree of inflammation after 3 months of treatment.
