A 42-year-old male with HIV-1 infection in stage C3 due to a prior pneumonia caused by cystis jirovecii, with poor therapeutic compliance.
She had received several antiretroviral treatment lines: initially efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, later darunavir, co-administered emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and ultimately tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Natural of the Czech Republic, Spain had received uninterrupted recognition in the last 15 years.
He worked as a caregiver for horses and other domestic animals (dogs).
He was a smoker of 11 packs/year and a drinker of 40 g of alcohol a day.
She did not report any drug allergies.
She came to the emergency department with a one month history of progressive fever of up to 39oC, associated with dyspnea on moderate exertion, chest pain of pleuritic characteristics and brownish sputum.
Physical examination revealed temperature of 38.2oC, AT 90/50 mmHg, SatO2 92% breathing room air and net feeling of disease, being well perfused and hydrated, and eupneic at rest.
No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathies were detected.
He had multiple verrucous lesions in upper and lower limbs, and lesions compatible with muguet in the oropharynx.
He was conscious, oriented, with normal language and cranial nerves, no meningeal signs and normal muscle balance and osteotendinous reflexes.
The cardiac tones were rhythmic without murmurs and vesicular murmur was preserved without appreciating overlapping sounds.
The abdomen was blade, without masses, visceromegaly or signs of peritoneal irritation.
He had no edema and pulses were symmetrical.
▁Complementary tests performed in the emergency room showed hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dl, 9.160 leukocytes/mm3 with▁lymphopenia (230 lymphocytes/mm3) and 316,300 platelets/mm3.
The biochemical study was normal except for C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.26 mg/dl (normal up to 0.5 mg/dl).
Urinary sediment showed no abnormalities.
A chest X-ray showed a cavitary condensating lesion in the right upper lobe (RUL).
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 98 beats per minute with no changes in repolarization.
Given the complementary tests, the patient was diagnosed with cavitated pneumonia in LSD, with a score of 42 on the FINE scale.
He was admitted to Internal Medicine ward for treatment and diagnostic study in respiratory isolation.
A microbiological study was performed, requesting hemorrhaging, Legionella spp antigenuria and pneumococcus, serial sputum smears and sputum culture (conventional bacteria culture and long-standing fluorescence for Pi immunofluorescence).
The serology of Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., Brucella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, hepatotropic virus (HAV, HBV and HCV), cytomegalovirus and loes was completed.
Lymphocyte subpopulations and HIV viral load were also requested.
Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours and clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours, waiting for microbiological results.
Differential diagnosis In this case, we must take into account some important aspects to establish a correct differential diagnosis.
Firstly, it is a patient with HIV infection whose immunovirological situation is unknown, since this is a patient with irregular follow-up in consultation and especially close contact with horses who has relevant epidemiological backgrounds (sometimes directed against others).
The reason for the patient's consultation and the analytical and radiographic findings lead us to orient towards an infectious etiology as the first diagnostic hypothesis.
There are several pathogens to consider.
P. jirovecii.
The clinical presentation is very diverse, from a normal chest X-ray to diffuse, interstitial, asymmetrical and irregular alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the upper lobes.
The most important risk factor is immunosuppression with less than 200 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes.
Bacterial pneumonia.
There are several microorganisms that could be involved, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhococcus equi and Haemophilus nonsteroides.
In relation to cavitated pneumonia, it is important to consider, mainly, R. equi and N. asteroides, especially if the course is subacute or chronic and with a very low level of CD4 lymphocytes extrapulmonary, and especially in patients.
Cavitated pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa can be fulminant especially if associated with bacteremia.
Other agents implicated could be Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catalysis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis.
Tuberculosis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the opportunistic agents that most frequently affect patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Apical infiltrates and cavitated disease can be observed, as well as atypical infiltrates, pleural effusions, miliary disease or normal chest X-ray.
Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, especially Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) and Mycobacterium kansasii.
Active infection by these pathogens should be suspected when the patient has a severe immunosuppression (less than 50 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes).
The chest X-ray can show diffuse and local infiltrates, cavitated lesions, nodules, etc.
Fungal infection
Among the agents that could cause cavitated pneumonia we consider Cryptococcus neoformas, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Penicillium marneffei, Aspergillus fumigatus and others
Parasitic infection.
To highlight T. gondii as an opportunistic agent in patients with less than 100 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes.
J. E. vestiofluorescence antigenuria of pneumococcus and Legionella were negative, serology was negative for Brucella, T. gondii, HAV, HBV, HCV and loci were negative, and
Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass compatible with pneumonia that had become manifest in LSD, consistent with the image on the previous chest X-ray.
In the immunovirological study, 217 total lymphocytes/mm3 were observed, representing 13 CD4/mm3 lymphocytes (6%) and 80 CD8/mm3 lymphocytes, with HIV viral load of 113,526 copies/ml.
Antibiotic prophylaxis was initiated with trimethoprim/methoprim-methoprim-methoprim-mettoxazol (TMP/SMX) 160/800 mg three times a week.
After five days of hospitalization, the provisional result of sputum culture was received, showing abundant growth of R. equi.
Serial bacilliococci were negative.
Antimicrobial treatment was modified, directed according to the antibiogram, to imipen 500 mg every 6 hours, clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours and rifampicin 600 mg every day, leaving the patient at 48 hours suffering from constipation.
The definitive report of sputum culture revealed the isolation of a parasite from Serratia plymuthica, so clarithromycin was suspected by levofloxacin.
After this change in antimicrobial therapy, the patient began again with high fever, which disappeared when clarithromycin was restarted.
After one week of antibiotic treatment, antiretroviral treatment was restarted, which the patient had voluntarily suspended during the previous seven months, with emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and raltegravir.
Ten days after starting antibiotic treatment, the patient developed generalized pruritus and redness in the face, neck and lower limbs, as well as worsening of her skin lesions.
Analytically this progressive disease was eliminated, so imipenem, TMP/SMX and clarithromycin were discontinued, starting antihistamine treatment with 25 mg of hydroxycin daily.
TMP/SMX and clarithromycin were then reintroduced without incidents, and oral linezolid 600 mg was added every 12 hours.
The patient had no new rash episodes and the absolute count and percentage of▁eosinophils normalized.
Biopsy of one of the previously described cutaneous lesions was performed, with negative culture and smear, and anatomopathological diagnosis of psoriasiform dermatitis.
Pathological diagnosis was made considering lesions compatible with nodular pruritus and topical▁steroids.
After three weeks of parenteral treatment, the patient showed significant clinical improvement, so he was discharged with clarithromycin and rifampicin until the next visit.
Final diagnosis▁Right upper lobe cavitated pneumonia caused by Rhococcus equi.
HIV infection in stage C3.
Oral candidiasis.
