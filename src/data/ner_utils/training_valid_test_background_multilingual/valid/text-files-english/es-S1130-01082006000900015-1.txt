A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 18 years of age without requiring treatment.
In October 2002 she experienced new episodes of diarrhoea of 3-4 stools/day with red blood cell.
Anamnesis by devices without remarkable alterations.
A rectal examination revealed an excretory lesion measuring 3-5 cm in the anal margin.
Serology HIV, lues, Epstein-style and cytomegalovirus negative.
Rectal medication prescribed was prescribed. The patient reported ulcerated anus within 2-3 cm of ulcerated anus (hybrid and anatomopathological features of ulcerated lesions with signs of dysplasia in the epithelium covered with steroid material).
A new entity reports inflammation of a hyperplastic▁polyp- tubular adenoma of the rectum. The patient was referred for surgical intervention performed in January 2004 and underwent transanal resection of the chronic lesion.
After reviewing the patient's history given the discrepancy between the clinic, the histology of the lesion as well as its evolution in the time, it was decided to revise all biopsy specimens, not finding a▁polyposis vellus adenoma together.
