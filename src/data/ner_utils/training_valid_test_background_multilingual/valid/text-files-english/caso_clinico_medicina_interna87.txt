An 81-year-old man with a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypoacusis, sigma adenocarcinoma operated by laparoscopy 8 months earlier (who had complete resection with free margins), complaining of intense asthenia, two months ago (walking,▁malaise).
He had also presented an isolated episode of fever of up to 38oC without a clear focus that had resolved after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
The previous month, he had come to a neurologist for this reason, who diagnosed mild parkinsonism and depressive syndrome, sertraline and requested cerebral MRI, which only showed the association with age-subcortical.
Three months before, she had started mechanical low back pain, which she had been evaluated by a traumatologist and treated with corticosteroids,▁benzodiazepines and morphine derivatives for one month, showing a slight lumbar spondylolisthesis.
The physical examination showed a regular general state of asthenical habit.
He was conscious, oriented and cooperative, although he appeared to have bipsychia and mild branesia.
Neurological examination was normal without focality.
His systolic blood pressure was 110 mmHg and his diastolic blood pressure was 55 mmHg.
Cardiac auscultation revealed rhythmic tone without murmurs, and pulmonary auscultation was normal.
The abdomen was blunt and depressible without masses or enlargement.
The lower limbs did not present edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Peripheral lymphadenopathy was not present.
In analytical we found: Urea 82 mg/dL (20-50), Creatinine 0.77 mg/dL (0.65-1.35), Fe 48 mcg/dL (50-150), Ferritinine 334 ng/dL (HCV 188 x 15.25-5.899), total (H 48 mcg/5.810
(27-31), Platelets 46x10^9/L (130-400), VSG 78 mm (1-20), Quick Index 100% (75-110), TP 10 sec (8-13.8).
Pathogen 4.45 g/L (1.55-5.55).
Calcium, phosphorus and thyroid hormones were within normal range.
Peripheral blood smear (PBF) confirms thrombopenia without platelet aggregates and evidences Rouleaux phenomenon, the▁erythroid series without findings and the normal manual formula, without dysplastic features.
Urinary sediment showed proteinuria in dipstick >300mg/dl and hematuria of 2 cells per field.
serum albumin levels were similar in all patients, with serum IgM levels of 152 positive for beta-protein; serum albumin levels were similar in all patients.
Mantoux test was performed, which was also negative.
A chest X-ray was also requested, which showed only mild cardiomegaly already known, and an abdominal ultrasound, which was normal (spleen and liver of normal size without lesions, no free fluid or pathological thickening intestinal loops).
Given the negativity of the complementary tests so far it was decided to extend the study with aspirate and bone marrow biopsy.
A cytological study of the aspirate was performed, showing conserved series, without dysplasia, regenerative aspect and 5% plasma cells.
Flow cytometry does not show suggestive populations of pathology, and the pathological study of the biopsy also results within normal limits.
At this point, two weeks after the first consultation, the patient developed fever again.
These are intermittent fever peaks up to 39°c and predominantly in the evening without apparent clinical focus, so hospital admission was decided to complete the study, starting broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin.
Given the history of neoplasic disease and low back pain, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis and a dorsolumbar MRI were performed to rule out malignancy or occult infectious focus.
The tomography detected cardiomegaly and prostatic hypertrophy, ruling out adenopathies, nodules or thickening of the digestive tract that suggested neoplasia.
Magnetic resonance imaging reports spondyloarthritis with disc protrusions at L2-L3 and L5-S1 levels, with no other findings.
On admission, laboratory tests showed persistent anemia and thrombopenic: Hb 10.7g/dL (12-16), platelets 55x10^9/L, significant increase in proteinuria and hematuria (urine protein 3.2 mg/24h and inflammatory field protein 52
feverish syndrome, bicytic and glomerulopathy (¿glomerulonephritis?)
Anticardiolipin antibody titre <10 IU/mL (0-14), antinuclear antibody 0.7 ratio (0.0-1.0), IgG anti-dsDNA antibody titre <0.9 ml (0-20), IgM complement
The decrease in C3 levels and the increase in C-ANCA are noteworthy.
Likewise, when a dubious systolic heart murmur with an aortic focus was found in the physical examination during admission, an echocardiography was performed which showed an aortic valve at the level of the ventricular side of the non-sigmoid colonic image.
Levofloxacin was immediately withdrawn and empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment was initiated for infective endocarditis with daptomycin 10 mg/kg/day, gentamicin 1mg/kg/8h and ampicillin 2/4h.
Three days after the beginning of this regimen, yeast growth was reported in 2 out of 3 hemocultives at admission, adding anhydrase 200mg/day and fluconazole 200mgh.
Five days later these yeasts are identified as C. famata, growing in 6 of 7 hemocultives until now.
Antibiotic therapy was then discontinued, removing daptomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin.
Revisits of hospital nutrition received cultures the patient had presented two positive hemocultives for this same antibiotic profile for the same 8 months, with parenteral sensitivity, admitted for laparoscopic surgery of sigmoid neoplasia, during which
After 10 days of treatment with anidulaline and fluconazole, the latter was substituted by voriconazole at a dose of 200mg/12h for a better sensitivity pattern.
Eleven days after the change and due to the pattern of casev stasis in analytical tests (GGT 347 U/L, FA 729 mU/mL), it was decided to withdraw both and restarte fluconazole 400po/24mg/ev/12h.
▁Periodic echocardiography was performed without evidence of local complication of endocarditis, resuming slightly the size of the sinus in serial studies.
She also presented progressive improvement of proteinuria during admission (1.85g/24h at 20 days of treatment initiation).
Surgical treatment of vegetation was not performed due to comorbidity and the patient and family refusal to invasive procedures.
As for distant complications, a few days after admission, the patient presented with pain in the right foot with evidence of simple arthritis plaque and tarsal radiographic pain compatible with arthritis, with no changes in visual acuity or visual acuity.
On the other hand and after 25 days of directed treatment she presented clinical intermittent claudication in lower limbs with right predominance.
Arterial Doppler ultrasound was performed with findings suggestive of stenosis >50% in the left popliteal artery, obstruction of the right external iliac artery with pre-occlusion of the right popliteal and dorsalis pedis artery.
Currently the patient is maintained with oral fluconazole with good clinical evolution without new fever peaks and negative serial hemocultives.
It has required stent placement due to its arterial pathology without being able to rule out the possibility that it is a complication of the infection.
