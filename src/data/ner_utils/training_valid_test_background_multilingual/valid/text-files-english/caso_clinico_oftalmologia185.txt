A 38-year-old, bisexual patient, diagnosed with HIV infection in 1992, currently in stage C3 (CD 4 291 cells/μl, viral load 4,400 copies/ml) came to the emergency room with left eye visual acuity.
The clinical picture was accompanied by a rash affecting palms and soles and▁malaise of one month of evolution without abundant exploration revealed intense visual acuity of hand movement in the left eye, with moderate conjunctival-equie, cellularity in posterior.
The eyebrow was unexplorable.
The following day, the fundus was explored after intensive corticosteroid therapy and midline topical corticosteroids, showing intense colitis and lower vitreous condensations.
The skin examination revealed an erythematous-violaceous maculo-papular rash with small oval plaque lesions that also affected palms and soles.
Serology was positive with positive RPR 1/32, IgG and TPHA.
Lumbar puncture was performed for the study of cerebrospinal fluid, obtaining a cell count of 2 leukocytes/μl negative and anti-LV antigen, total proteins 295 mg/dl IgG, glucose 65 mg/dl (glycemia IgG 0.3dl).
Topical treatment with corticosteroids and midline, and systemic treatment with sodium penicillin G was started at doses of 4 million units every 4 hours for 15 days.
The evolution was satisfactory with recovery of visual acuity to 0.9, resolution of inflammation and arthritis and disappearance of the exanthema.
