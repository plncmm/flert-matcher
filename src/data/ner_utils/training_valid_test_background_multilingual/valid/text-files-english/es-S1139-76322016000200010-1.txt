An eight-year-old girl, diagnosed with bosian meningitis, presented to our health center with intermittent vaginal bleeding and mucopurulent and malolent vaginal discharge two months ago.
Physical examination revealed severe congestion and edema of the hymen and vulvar introitus.
The girl with her parents and a paternal uncle with her partner in the same house and not in sexual abuse.
The patient was referred to the emergency department for differential diagnosis of vaginal foreign body and ruling out sexual abuse.
A gynecological examination was performed, where a vaginal foreign body was ruled out and a vaginal▁exudate sample was taken.
In turn, she was assessed by the forensic physician of the daycare center, who issued a judicial part that ruled out signs of sexual abuse.
Vaginal▁exudate culture was positive for Shigella sonnei resistant according to the antibiogram to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, penicillin and combination of gentamicin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid susceptible trimpetoprim, gentamicin and cefoxime.
Coprocultive culture of perianal▁exudate and urine culture were also requested, which were negative.
Antibiotic treatment with cefuroxime axetil was prescribed for ten days, with clinical manifestations and great clinical improvement, but without complete resolution, so the same treatment regimen was repeated, disappearing.
