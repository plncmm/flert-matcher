A 4-year-old girl with no relevant past medical history presented with painful left cervical swelling and fever (38oC), with few hours of evolution.
The day before, after complaining of pain at the occipital level, the parents observed a scalp tick that was removed manually.
Three days before, the child had been in a rural area in contact with animals.
On physical examination, a 1 cm erythematous plaque with a normal ipsilateral exanthema is observed on the tick bite area, in the left parietoccipital region, with a normal ipsilateral cervical swelling.
Plaque of 1 cm in diameter, with central necrosis after tick bite.
A complete blood count and biochemistry were performed with normal results, without elevation of acute phase reactants, and a cervical ultrasound showed lymphadenopathies of inflammatory characteristics, predominantly in the left laterocervical region, not greater than 3.2 cm.
Cervical ultrasound.
Adenopathy of 3.2 x 1.2 cm, inflammatory and non-accessified characteristics.
Ev.‚ñÅ~~~ Sepsis closed-loop syndrome caused by tick-borne lymphadenopathy or TIBOLA (their English acronym Tick-Borne Lymphadenopathy).
Treatment was initiated with oral contraceptives (5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours) in a short course of 2 days.
Affected patients within the first 24 hours, with progressive reduction of cervical adenitis until asymptomatic.
Serology was performed at diagnosis and at 6 weeks against Rickettsia conorii and Borrelia burdorferi (the only serology available in our area) with negative results.
Among the numerous zoonoses whose vector is tick, it is important to know the manifestations of those that are most common in our country.
Among these, the tick-borne or TIBOLA lymphadenopathy stands out.
This entity is included in the group of diseases known as Manchae Fibers caused by bacteria of the Ri mental retardation (obacillos Gram negative intracellulares) gene and transmitted by ticks.
The main agent isolated in these cases is Ritsia saca, although other pathogens have been isolated, such as Rilovsia raoultii, Riultii clinical manifestations in riverja patients.
The vectors are the vectors of the genus marginalcentor (Dermacentoratus in the Mediterranean countries, and vector reticularis in the Center and East of Europe).
In recent years, TIBOLA, which is also known as DEBONEL (Dermacentor-borne necrosis erythema botadenopathy differential) or SENLAT (Scalp eschar a biteLA neck lymphadenopathy) has a
