A 20-year-old mestizo female from the Peruvian jungle of Iquitos, Loreto, was admitted with fever and lymphadenopathy for a month and a half.
She did not report any pathological antecedents of interest, had received blood transfusions and had had sexual intercourse with protection with a single partner.
The patient also presented a progressive increase in▁parotid volume associated with facial edema.
One week before admission, the patient reported progressive dysphagia to solids.
On physical examination, the temperature was 39.5°C, and the patient presented lymphadenopathies in the submandibular, axillary, cervical and left hemipelvic areas, and hepatomegaly.
A complete blood count was performed: 10.7 g/dl, white blood cell count >90 cc, platelet count = 179.000 cc, platelet count > 3mm.
Coagulation, liver and kidney function tests were normal.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was high: 1,020 mg/dl.
HTLV-1 serology was positive and HIV negative.
A chest X-ray revealed a tumor mass located in the middle lobe of the right lung.
A biopsy of one of the axillary lymph nodes was performed. Histological study showed diffuse proliferation of▁lymphoid cells with low cytoplasm and a high mitotic index, without flower cells.
The findings suggested a▁lymphoproliferative process, consistent with a▁lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Bronchoscopy was performed to study the thoracic tumor mass. Histopathological analysis revealed small cells associated with the▁lymphoproliferative process.
Immunohistochemistry of lymph node tissue and lung tumor was positive for specific markers, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+.
In summary, the diagnosis of lymphomatous ATL was made by clinical, pathological and▁immunohistochemical findings.
Proviral integration in host DNA was demonstrated by PCR (proviral load was 666).
In addition, the▁immunohistochemical study of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed, because the patient presented neurological deterioration manifested by seizures.
The CSF showed a specific leukocyte isolation with expression of markers such as CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, CD25+, CD45+.
The patient received chemotherapy with COPDH (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, doxorubicin and vincristine) associated with intrathecal prophylaxis according to their neurological impairment.
Post-chemotherapy presented an episode of febrile neutropenia that was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
The patient died a few days later due to septic shock and neurological complications.
