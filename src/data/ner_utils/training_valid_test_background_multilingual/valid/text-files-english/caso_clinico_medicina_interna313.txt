A 59-year-old male was admitted for a 4-week history of asthenia, anorexia, fever and dry cough.
No fever, titres, or other associated symptoms.
His medical history included hypertension, LBP, hypothyroidism,‚ñÅOSAS treated with CPAP, stable ischemic heart disease with LVEF of 30%, urothelial carcinoma treated with BCG (two months before the onset of attenuated bladder cancer) in October 2018 (
Physical examination only revealed erythema pharyngo-cutaneous.
Analytically, CRP1 4.52mg/dL and ferritin 1542 ng/mL, the rest anodyne.
Serology: negative.
Chest X-ray: peri-bronchovascular thickening.
IGRA: positive.
Acquirement of consolidation-non-pelvic pattern: diffuse bilateral nodullary pattern in lung parenchyma that may correspond to miliary TBC.
No lymphadenopathy or involvement of the pleural space.
Discreta is a homogeneous anomaly.
Serology negative.
Bronchoscopy showed nodular images in the mucosa of the LSI.
Bronchoaspiration was performed with positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis with complex positive PCR2 (Myc Tuberculosis, Bo Africanum, bovis BCG).
BAL was also performed with Gram stain, bacteriological culture and culture for positives, Ziehl-Neelsen and Auramine stain, all of which were negative.
Bone marrow aspiration was performed and PCR2 multiplex tuberculosis was performed, which proved to be positive and cultured for positives where Mycobasterium bovis BCG grows.
It is therefore diagnosed as a disseminated infection secondary to BCG instillation for treatment of urothelial carcinoma and reactivation of latent myc tuberculosis.
Treatment was initiated with Rifampicin + Etambutol + Isoniazid and piracinamide for 2 months and then 4 months with dual antibiotic therapy with good evolution to date.
Reactivation of latent TBC and disseminated infection by mycosis bovis attenuated after BCG instillation for treatment of urothelial carcinoma have been described in the literature as rare but potentially fatal complications.
There are even more few cases in which isolation by positive culture has been achieved, and the usual management is empirical treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs based on clinical suspicion.
