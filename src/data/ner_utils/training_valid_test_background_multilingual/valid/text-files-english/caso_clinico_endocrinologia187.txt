This is a 44-year-old male with HIV-HCV co-infection, who was followed up by the Infectious Diseases Unit of our hospital.
As the only remarkable history, she was diagnosed with osteoporosis about 5 years ago.
From the consultations of this Unit it was decided to enter the plant for study of constitutional syndrome.
None of the usual battery of tests for the study of this syndrome resulted except for the detection of hormonal pattern diagnosis of primary hyperthyroidism.
After consultation with endocrinology, she was finally diagnosed with primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) as the cause of her clinical picture.
The results of the analytical determinations at the time of diagnosis were: TSH: 0.01 μUI/ml, FT4: 4.88 ng/dl and positive for antibodies to the TSH receptor.
Thyroid scintigraphy showed homogeneous and diffuse hyperuptake of the radiotracer.
Treatment with thiamazol was initiated for hyperthyroidism at an initial dose of 30 mg daily relapsed in 3 doses.
One month after discharge, the patient was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit due to diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, hypotension and nonspecific asthenia.
Analytically, hyponatremia (133 mEq/l, normal values 135 – 145 mEq/l) and hyperkalemia (5.2 mEq/l, normal range 3.5 – 5 mEq/l) stood out.
The hyperthyroidism situation was not yet controlled, persisting low levels of TSH and high levels of peripheral hormones (FT4 and FT3).
Again, the patient was seen with endocrinology, establishing the diagnosis of suspected AI.
The adrenal axis study confirmed the suspicion.
Serum cortisol levels at baseline were 1.1 μg/dl and ACTH levels were suppressed (<5 pg/ml).
The stimulation test with cosintropin showed an insufficient adrenal response (7.6 μg/dl and 10.7 μg/dl at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively).
Anti-adrenal colitis antibodies and tuberculosis were negative.
[(1.5 ng/dl; secondary adrenal insufficiency; pituitary hormone study (PRL 17.6 ng/ml -236) was completed; IGF-1 128 ng/ml [9060] age and sex 124-120;
In the absence of other causes of pituitary axis inhibition, we thought of a probable pharmacological etiology and the patient was re-interrupted in a directed way to rule out the recent use or cessation of drugs or products with corticoid effect.
The patient was prescribed about 11 years ago 240 mg/day of AM which was irregularly taken according to appetite.
During that time, he spent wide intervals without taking it, but never suffered any addict.
He resumed his intake one year before his first admission and, both at that admission and at the present time, he had continued to take it without changes in dosage or frequency of use.
At that time, breastfeeding was discontinued and the patient started hydrolytic treatment with cetirizine, with symptoms paulatinously disappearing.
During follow-up, the corticosteroid dose was progressively decreased and radioiodine was administered to control hyperthyroidism.
One year later, cortisol and ACTH levels were normal (19.8 μg/dl and 5.79 μg/ml, respectively) without the need to maintain corticosteroid therapy.
Similarly, testosterone levels returned to normal.
Table 1 shows the most relevant analytical findings.
The definitive diagnosis of the patient was secondary adrenal insufficiency by inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by AM precipitated by primary autoimmune hyperthyroidism.
