Anamnesis A 36-year-old patient with no drug allergies.
Surgical history: resection of a▁polyp in a vocal cord, laparoscopic right salpinguectomy for ectopic pregnancy in 2013.
Since the 25th week of pregnancy she consulted in the Emergency Department on several occasions for symptoms compatible with urinary tract infection (UTI), requiring change of antibiotic on four occasions to achieve symptom control.
Urocultives were positive for Escherichia coli.
I depart without incidents on August 16, 2014.
Six days later the patient presented with fever and severe abdominal pain.
Transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound was requested, observing free intraperitoneal fluid.
Purulent urine was obtained with bladder catheterization.
Given these findings, it was decided to complete the study with an urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) and hospital admission in Urology.
Physical status Patient with good general condition.
Aware and oriented.
Eupneic at rest.
Cardiac and pulmonary alterations were normal.
Abdomen: diffuse percussion▁tympanism, with generalized pain at palpation.
No signs of peritoneal irritation were observed.
Bilateral negative renal failure.
Normal gynecological position, except for bladder anterior superior wall pain.
▁Complementary tests' urine sediment: negative.
» Vaginal▁exudate: E beta-lactamase producing bacteria extended spectrum and Candida glabrata.
» Analysis: leukocytosis (27,000 leukocytes/mm3) with 93% neutrophils.
Normal rectum.
» Abdominal CT: abundant intraperitoneal fluid, mostly in the minor pelvis.
Reflex ileus.
Extensive tumor growth of the left bladder wall with contrast enhancement.
No lymphadenopathies.
I'm back without findings.
» Exploratory laparotomy: abundant free peritoneal fluid secondary to perforation in the posterior aspect of the bladder.
Closure of the wall was performed with intraoperative biopsy.
» Pathological result of the intraoperative sample: squamous cell carcinoma.
Diagnosis To reach the complete diagnosis was performed in a second time radical cystectomy with Bricker derivation and hysterectomy.
» Anatomopathological diagnosis: mixed histological pattern, with areas of conventional urothelial carcinoma (15%), areas of squamous differentiation (20%) and sarcomatoid areas (65%).
» PET-CT: two liver lesions of 11 and 18 mm with maximum SUV 3.4 and 5.7 respectively.
» The patient is diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder pT3aN0M1.
Treatment It was decided to start palliative chemotherapy on December 9, 2014 with adriamycin 75 mg/m2 day 1 + ifosfamide 3 g/m2 days 1-3 + MESNA IV days 1-3.
Febrile neutropenia grade 4 occurred after the first cycle.
After administration of the second, grade 2 febrile neutropenia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa UTI appeared, requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment for resolution.
The PET reassessment after completing three cycles showed an increase in size and metabolic activity of liver lesions (50 and 51 mm with SUVmax 4.9 and 5.8).
In addition, several adjacent peritoneal implants are detected sigma and muscles.
Due to progression, on March 2, 2015 cisplatin 80 mg/m2 day 1 + gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 was started.
He received three cycles, with side effects that forced to reduce the dose by 20% in the second cycle.
At present, a new PET-CT scan for the evaluation of response is pending.
