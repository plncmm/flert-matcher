A two-year-old boy presented immediately after eating a small piece of foit (Espetec, Tarradellas house), intense lip swelling lasting hours, and on two occasions mild urticaria after contact.
At 3 years of age, a similar episode was seen after the ingestion of a ham (manipulate with gloves used with other sausages).
Allergological study (3 years and 3 months): Prick test: Histamine: 8x6mm.
Penicillium notatum 13x8mm Prick prick: Fuet (piel) 9x6mm.
Fot (without skin) (-).
Negative provocation with foramen without skin.
Positive provocation (6 months later) by contact in labial mucosa with foramen (skin), with erythema and small wheals.
Oral provocation with positive foramen (skinned) after ingestion of 15 grams, presenting bilateral conjunctival injection, more in left eye, with tears.
The manufacturer confirms the use of the parasite in the envelope of the foramen, identifying the envelope by genetic analysis as Penicillium sp.
Median SDS-PAGE immunoblotting is detected in both Penicillium sp.
(procedure of the skin of the foramen) as in Penicillium notatum, high fixation of IgE in a band of approximately 17-18 kDa; another with lower intensity of 31/30 kDa and fixation at high molecular weight
We emphasize this case because of its precautionality.
Food and contact allergy to Penicillium in the wrapper of the foramen was demonstrated, and a molecular mass IgE-fixing band (18 kDa) similar to that observed in other published cases was detected.
The patient is recommended to avoid foods that contain the protein.
