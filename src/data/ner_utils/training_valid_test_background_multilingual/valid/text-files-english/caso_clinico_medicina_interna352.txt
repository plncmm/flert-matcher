Personal Background We report the case of a 70-year-old man with autoimmune hemolytic anemia IgG with▁steroids (the development of corticodependency, carrying out a resection performed due to feverish syndrome caused by active chronic infectionB).
Current disease was referred from another center due to fever, tachyarrhythmia, thrombopenia and impaired renal function.
She developed severe sepsis and started broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy after culture.
Physical examination initially revealed BP 107/53 mmHg, HR 84 bpm, 38.6oC, RR 16 bpm, saturation 99% (oxnea additional to 3 bpm), and no other mucocutaneous findings.
▁Complementary Tests In analytical shed light on macrocytosis, bilirubin elevation due to indirect signs and LDH normal.
Serology tests were performed, showing positivity for IgM EBV and viral load of 2700 copies, the rest anodyne.
Clinical Pathological Pathway, on the seventh day of admission, the day care center in the medical area performs evaluation due to pain when moving the lower limbs.
Examination revealed minimal bilateral paresis (probably present due to pain), without edema or erythema.
The symptoms resolved with paracetamol.
Upon reassessing him, he was tachypneic and markedly diaphoretic.
At this time, it was found important anemization, with greater thrombopenia (around 6000/μL) and deterioration of renal function.
Cranial CT (without findings) and intra-abdominal contrast CT (discrete free perihepatic fluid and rectal pouch fundus, bilateral pleural effusion and subcutaneous cellular tissue edema, without active bleeding) were requested.
She was contacted at the Hematology Department (transfusional support was indicated), and intensive care unit (not requiring advanced organ support).
After making a differential diagnosis and when there is a high suspicion of hemophagocytic syndrome triggered after active EBV infection, blood tests are requested, highlighting hyperferritinemia (post transfusion) and bone marrow hypertriglyceridemia and visual biopsy.
Five out of eight criteria for this condition and due to clinical worsening (required transfer to the ICU starting hemodialysis) treatment was started with topography (400 copies of dexamethasone and▁cyclosporine), finding clinical improvement and decrease of symptoms.
She was discharged with adequate ambulation.
He is currently following successive outpatient follow-up visits.
