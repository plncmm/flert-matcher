A 55-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department by her brother because in the last 3 weeks she had noticed a strange behavior in the patient.
Among the behavioral changes, his brother mentioned: episodes of verbal aggression, neglect of personal and home sit, temporary lapses in which he could contact without her from home for several hours.
The patient was born in Almeria, currently living in Granada for 15 years.
He had been a professional manager for three years.
His companion did not recognize himself as a personal or family history of interest.
She was taking fluoxetine daily (as prescribed by her primary care physician for depressive purposes).
In the direct anamnesis, the patient manifests itself as an emergency for weeks of suffering, both her parents, a "tumor in the head" (the reason for which she had already demanded medical attention on multiple occasions, in different occasions).
As a physical data of interest, her relatives had detected a loss of 10 kg related to decreased intake, which the patient considered necessary, since she was▁convinced that she was going to undergo a surgical procedure.
The initial physical examination revealed fever, with the exception of a slight tendency to tachycardia.
Attention was paid to a marked thinness, but no other data were found to stand out in the rest of the physical examination.
Initial complementary tests • ECG: sinus tachycardia at 118 bpm, axis at 60o, normal conduction, without acute changes in repolarization.
• Urgent analysis: fasting glucose, renal function and electrolytes unchanged.
C-reactive protein (CRP) 63.57 mg/l.
LDH 558.6 U/ml.
The hemogram showed normocytic and normochromic anemia with hemoglobin figures of 8.2 g/l.
8300 leukocytes/ mm3 with▁lymphopenia (lymphocytes 11.3%), normal platelets.
Basic coagulation with INR values 1.48 and prothrombin activity of 55.7%.
After initial assessment, it was decided to be admitted to the psychiatric ward to complete the study of psychotic symptoms of onset.
At 48h after admission, the patients were referred to the internal medicine ward for evaluation of fever and deterioration of the patient's level of consciousness.
The patient is febrile (38.5o) and with low level of consciousness, semi-comatose with little response to painful stimuli and no response to verbal stimuli, so it was decided to perform an urgent cranial CT and subsequent lumbar puncture.
Cranial CT only demonstrated diffuse cortical atrophic changes, ruling out lesions that could produce mass or bleeding effect, so a lumbar puncture was performed with a clear H2O outflow pressure of 14 cm.
The biochemical analysis showed glucose levels of 69 mg/dl (serum glucose 114 mg/dl) and proteins 40.7 g/L.
The cytology reported the presence of 0 leukocytes/ mm3 and 1 leukocytes/mm3 and absence of microorganisms in Gram stain.
Due to the severity of the clinical picture, despite the normal CSF analysis, it was decided to start treatment with Avir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/8h due to the possibility of herpetic encephalitis.
Herpesvirus PCR was requested in CSF, enterovirus PCR in CSF, MRI and complete analytical with general biochemistry, acute phase reactants, serology, ferrokinetic and autoimmunity.
Differential diagnosis All those mental disorders in which the patient loses at some point the correct judgment of reality are those traditionally recognized as psychotic disorders.
This group should include dementias, organic or symptomatic psychosis, psychotic manic-substance psychosis, and schizophrenia as well as psychosis-like illness, psychosis-like illness, and schizophrenia,
In order to make a better diagnostic classification, the ICD-10 has restricted the term, currently considering acute psychosis as the "heterogeneous group of disorders common to patients with acute onset of psychotic symptoms such as delirium, severe perception.
It is necessary for the diagnosis to have ruled out the existence of an organic cause".
Therefore, the diagnosis itself is exclusive and requires a screening of underlying organic pathology.
It should be borne in mind that acute onset seizures (such as those occurring with altered level of consciousness, memory deficit or late onset), should be considered as a possible first-time psychotic disorder secondary to a general medical condition or a mental disorder.
There is no doubt that this case could be classified as late onset: it is a 55-year-old woman with no previous psychiatric pathology data.
However, there are other data that make impasse the application of the term "psychosis" to the clinical picture, such as: the low level of consciousness with which we find the patient and the existence of fever.
It is above all this first data, the decrease in the level of consciousness, which is crucial for the ratification of the existence of a delirium or acute confusional syndrome, the most appropriate expression to the current International Classification of Diseases that we take into account
Acute confusional syndrome is often associated with psychotic symptoms and its symptoms can fluctuate in intensity, usually appearing suddenly.
It should be remembered that it is a potentially reversible disorder without forgetting that there are certain etiologies that can cause, if not solved, permanent damage to the central nervous system.
There are many causes of diverse nature capable of producing it: endocrinological, metabolic, secondary to drug and drug consumption, infectious, structural CNS involvement.
On the day following the first assessment, herpesvirus and enterovirus PCR in CSF were negative, and treatment with AHF was suspended.
After the initial results of blood biochemistry, the existence of metabolic alterations is ruled out (renal and hepatic functions were preserved and there were no hydroelectrolytic alterations or malnutrition data).
In the hormonal study, thyroid function was normal, and autoantibodies (ANA, ENA and ANCAs) were negative.
A normocytic normochromic anemia persisted in the hemogram, detected at the beginning, that was stable, presenting leukopenia (2770 leukocytes/mm3) with▁lymphopenia (430/mm3).
The patient also had a ESR >140 mm/h.
The patient was single, had several occasional sexual partners.
It was not known if they used protective measures during sexual relations.
She recognized herself as a social consumer of alcohol; her family denied having knowledge about the consumption of other substances.
Contrast-enhanced cranial MRI did not detect space-occupying lesions or vascular or myelinating alterations suggestive of structural neurological pathology.
Several days later, serological results that were positive for HIV-1 were received.
An immunovirological study was then performed, which showed a total number of CD4 cells in 30 cells/mm3 (7%) and a serum viral load of 1,062,917 copies/ml.
A viral load was performed in CSF of 11,260 copies/ml.
These complementary tests showed the existence of advanced HIV infection, with severe immunosuppression, and high viral load in both blood and CNS.
Antiretroviral therapy was started, after ruling out the existence of tuberculosis infection with IGRA test that was negative, with tenofovir, emtricitabine and co-infectionistrate/elvitegravir, with good tolerance.
During her admission, the patient continued to have behavioral changes requiring psychiatric follow-up, which initiated haloperidol treatment.
Progressively there was a cognitive-behavioral improvement, persisting at discharge one month after admission, some temporary and personal disorientation.
The patient is reviewed after discharge from the outpatient clinic, 2 months after the start of antiretroviral treatment, being asymptomatic from the neuropsychiatric point of view and with almost total recovery of weight and usual daily activity.
Final diagnosis The final diagnosis was acute confusional syndrome secondary to HIV encephalopathy in women with late-diagnosed HIV infection, with AIDS criteria (C3 stage).
