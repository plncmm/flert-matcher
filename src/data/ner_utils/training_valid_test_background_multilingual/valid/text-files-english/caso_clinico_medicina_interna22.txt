 ECG: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal axis.
No significant changes in repolarization.
· Chest X-ray · Chest CT: no filling defects were observed in the main pulmonary, lobar and segmental arteries.
Pleural effusion was bilateral, minimal on the right side and larger on the left side.
Minimal pneumothorax in anterior segment of LSI and in anterior segment of LSI.
Small bilateral apical subpleural bullae.
Bilateral apical residual changes were observed.
Atelectasis of the LII with air bronchogram suggestive of passive atelectasis due to the presence of effusion and large hiatal hernia without ruling out pneumonic condensation.
Two infracarinal lymph nodes one 15 mm and another calcified.
Left hilia adenopathy of 10 mm that imprinted in the bronchi of the sequestration.
Cholate herniated.
The patient remains hypotensive during his stay in the emergency room, requiring fluid therapy and post-ration without neurological focus.
After hemodynamic stabilization, the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine under clinical judgment of respiratory origin and CAP in LII. Antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin, A bronchodilation therapy, and Chemotherapy with lidocaine was initiated.
Twenty-four hours after▁arriving at the plant, the patient presented with increased chest pain, desaturation and hemodynamic instability. New chest X-ray findings were requested, showing a worsening of the chest X-ray with the initial diagnosis.
The CT showed a perforation of the left epiphrenic diverticulum with associated pleuroparesis and left hydrothorax secondary to the previous one. A percutaneous closure of the fistula was performed due to the placement of a pouch.
The patient had no complications in the immediate postoperative period, although he required ICU stay for 5 days and vasoactive drugs during the first 24 hours after the intervention.
Antibiotic therapy with tige and fluconazole was completed with resolution of the septic picture.
Upon discharge, the patient was thermodynamically stable, with PEG, good tolerance to fluids with little output of material through the fistula as shown in the images of GI transit.
Clinical judgement • Epiphrenic esophageal perforation diverticulum, with recurrent pleuro-confirmitis secondary to septic shock associated with the common bile duct associated with · Left hydropneumothorax secondary to the above resolved pleural surgery ·
