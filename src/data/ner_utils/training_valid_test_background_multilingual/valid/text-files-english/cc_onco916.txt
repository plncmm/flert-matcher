Anamnesis This is a 62-year-old male, without known drug allergies, ex-smoker since December 2015 with a total accumulated consumption of 80 pack-years and moderate alcohol consumption until 2012.
He had worked as a welder.
She lives at home with her wife and has 3 children who provide good family support.
As relevant family history, a deceased sister of colon neoplasia stands out.
She had a history of hypercholesterolemia in pharmacological treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with inhaled tiotropium 18 mcg/day.
Her oncological history began in June 2016, when she consulted for right costal pain and dyspnea on moderate exertion for a week of evolution.
Physical examination revealed right costal pain with pleuritic features and no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy.
Respiratory auscultation revealed hypophonesis in the right pulmonary apex.
The rest of the physical examination by equipment, anodyne.
▁Complementary tests A chest X-ray was performed in which an image of occupation in the right upper lobe (RUL) with mediastinal widening was observed.
The patient was referred to the Diagnostic Unit with a mathenic venous adenocarcinoma of the lung (RCP), performing a computed tomography (CT) that showed an 80 mm pulmonary mass occupying the entire superior adenoprimary vena cavate and
A high right paraesophageal ganglion of 9 mm and a right adrenal mass of 31 mm were also observed.
Pathological needle aspiration revealed a pulmonary mass, which was a malignant tumor with fusiform cells compatible with sarcomatoid carcinoma.
Positron emission tomography (PET) was also performed, in which the lung mass was observed in hypermetabolic LSD with duplex as well as ineffective muscle and glottal fat adjacent to the right central venous metastasis, as well as brachial vein
Diagnosis Under the diagnostic orientation of lung cancer of sarcomatoid characteristics with bone, muscle and adrenal metastases, molecular markers were requested over the initial biopsy, the genetic material being insufficient for the ALchygene lymphoma-epithelial tumor growth factor receptor (EGFR-epithelial sarcoma).
Treatment While waiting for a new biopsy, first-line treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was initiated, considering that treatment with gemcitabine could be effective in sarcomatoid tumors.
She presented regular tolerance to treatment during the first cycle, with mucositis grade 1, an episode of fever without focality and neutropenia grade 3, so the beginning of the second cycle was postponed.
This clinical condition was also associated with a scheduled surgical biopsy.
The CT scan showed apelvic enhancement after two cycles, with a decrease in the size of the mass in LSD (80 mm to 56 mm) and an increase in size of the right adrenal lesion (31 mm).
In October 2016, the Plastic Surgery Team performed a new biopsy with pyramidal muscle exeresis, without evidence of malignancy, so a CT/PET was performed to plan the biopsy with greater profitability.
Finally, a CT-guided biopsy of the right paramediastinal lesion was performed, with the diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) suggestive of adenocarcinoma (TTF1 and p63 negative), with negative molecular study for ROS.
This result was re-oriented as a probable stage IV NSCLC due to bone and adrenal involvement with total response to bone involvement, partial response of lung injury and stability of adrenal lesion after 2 cycles of cisplatin-based gemcitabine therapy.
Given the delay in obtaining the diagnosis and the need to postpone the treatment for toxicity or for performing diagnostic procedures, it was decided to terminate the first line of treatment and to carry out controls with evaluation of the disease.
The patient was admitted to the emergency department due to an increase in cough with self-limiting hemoptoic expectoration.
In addition, it explained the appearance of right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
At the reassessment CT 4 months after the end of the first line of treatment, progression of the disease to the lymph node level (appearance of laterorenal mass x right adrenal nodule of 58 mm) to the right subclavicular lymph node was observed.
Clinically, the adenoptic cervical/subclavicular mazacote was observed and displayed very distinctly, about 8 cm from the physical examination.
At this time, it was decided to start a second line of treatment with nivolumab.
PDL-1 determination was requested in the tumor biopsy, which was positive in 10 % of the tumor cells.
During the first two cycles of treatment, the patient showed good tolerance and, after the first cycle, a clear decrease in the size of the right ganglion mazakate was observed.
During the third and fourth cycle, the patient presented grade 1 diarrhea as adverse effects.
A control CT was performed after 4 cycles of treatment, which showed resolution of the right laterocervical adenopatic▁conglomerate, a decrease in the size of the paramediastinal mass of the right adrenal nodule (from 32 to 12 mm), a decrease in size of the right adrenal lesion.
Therefore, the patient had a partial response after 4 cycles of nivolumab treatment.
Currently, the patient continues to be treated with nivolumab, having received a total of 7 cycles corresponding to 3 months of treatment, and is waiting for a new reassessment of the disease.
