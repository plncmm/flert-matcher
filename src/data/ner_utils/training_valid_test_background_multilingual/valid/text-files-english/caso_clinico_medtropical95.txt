A 56-year-old male patient, born in Ayacucho, from Sihuas (Assisted tools), where he has been living in the place since he was 14 years old, and has been a welder, is located near his work center.
She hasn't traveled to other places outside Ancash for five years.
He was admitted to the Emergency Department of the National Hospital Dos de Mayo on 05/03/2013, and then to the Santo Toribio medical ward, with a time of illness of 20 days, characterized by non-pyretic discomfort that takes night blindness
Three days before admission, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting and constipation.
Due to the persistence of the picture he decides to travel directly to Lima for his attention.
She denied cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
Background: Treatment-naïve patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (20 years ago).
Family history: four children, two women and two men (all with pulmonary TB for 15 years with complete treatment).
On physical examination her vital functions were: BP 90/50 mmHg.
HR: 120 beats/min.
RR: 28 breaths/minute.
T: 38.5 °C (oral).
Patient in regular general condition, poor hydration status, regular nutritional status, oriented, painful faces (severe pain in the left shoulder) lights sweating, burning, spontaneously.
Skin: poorly hydrated, warm in sclera and skin (++/+++), tenderness (++/+++).
Linf: bilateral retrocervical adenopathies.
0.5-1 cm, mobile, blandom, non-painful, inguinal lymphadenopathy of +/- 1.5 cm in diameter similar to the previous.
Respiratory system: vesicular murmur passes well in both hemithorax, rough breathing.
Cardiovascular system: rhythmic cardiac noises, not very intense, tachycardic, not murmurs.
Abdomen: blando, depresible, pain a diffuse deep palpation, with predominance of right hypochondrium, liver 6 cm below the right costal margin, non palpable liver spam of 13 cm
Neurological system: Glasgow 15 points.
Physical examination showed no abnormalities.
On admission, the laboratory tests showed Hb: 11.8 mg/dL, group O +; glucose: 102 mg/dL; leukocytes: 3%, direct negative Coombs test.
Antibodies non-reactive hepatitis C
Nonreactive hepatitis B surface antigen
Normal coagulation profile.
Serial electrolytes within normal limits.
The chest X-ray showed right apical pleural thickening and reticular images in the right lung with predominance of the apex (probably due to a sequel of previous process); subsequently, pulmonary tuberculosis became negative in sputum smears.
In the first three days of hospitalization, progressive deterioration of the general state was observed, as well as generalised worsening of mental illness, severe mental illness and mental illness, which increased.
Table 1 shows marked and persistent drop in hemoglobin levels, reaching severe anemia (Hb: 6.7 g/dL), doubling of high leukocyte levels in only one day (left shift) C reactive protein.
The patient had fever, signs and symptoms of bacteremia in the stool culture were positive, and the differential diagnosis of Carrions disease (Ancashs disease, Giangcids disease and Giangcids disease) were positive.
Given the torpid evolution and the persistence of fever and the patient's deterioration, we investigated overaggregated infections with the following tests: positive agglutination test for all positive titres, sudden honey, repeated
With these results it was concluded that the patient had severe Carrion disease complicated with acute leptospirosis.
During the evolution, there was an improvement in both clinical and biochemical patterns, gradually normalizing the levels of urea and creatinine.
Two packs of red blood cells were transfused and specific antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin) was established according to current technical standard, and after 10 days, the patient was discharged from the service.
