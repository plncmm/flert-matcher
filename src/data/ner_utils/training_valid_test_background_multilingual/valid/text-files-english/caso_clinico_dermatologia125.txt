dermal colitis associated with central ulceration, a sample of squamous colitis with positive result for cryptum rubrum is obtained and a biopsy is performed showing a sample lacking collagen fibers
The underlying dermis areas of collagen degeneration and interstitial inflammatory aggregates with neutrophilic predominance, compatible with collagen perforating collagen, present findings consistent with this condition.
