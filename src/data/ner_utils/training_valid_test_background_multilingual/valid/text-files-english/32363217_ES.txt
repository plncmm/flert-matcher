The mother was 41 years old and underwent emergency cesarean section because of severe preeclampsia at 38+4 weeks of gestation.
Pregnancy was achieved by in vitro fertilization; the mother had a history of hypothyroidism, for which she was treated.
The newborn was a low weight for gestational age (2500 g), an Apgar score of 7 to 1 min and 9 at 5 min; child resuscitation with oropharyngeal suction was not performed.
She was admitted to the neonatal unit due to immediate respiratory distress with continuous positive mechanical ventilation (CPP) without oxygen.
Assisted respiration was removed 2 h after birth and the results of physical examination at 9 h were normal.
The problems were attributed to stress during the passage to extra-uterine life; the patient was taken with her mother.
On day 3 after admission, the mother had a low-grade fever and obstetric complications were ruled out.
Two days later, the mother showed fever peaks and respiratory symptoms; a chest X-ray revealed severe bilateral pneumonia.
The mother had no history of travel to risk areas for coronavirus or contacts with infected individuals, although her partner had presented fever associated with gastroenteritis since the day of cesarean section.
After ruling out common viral diseases, a polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was ordered for detection of coronavirus 2019; this test detects two regions of the viral genome.
The result was positive.
Then a test was done to her partner, with a positive result.
So far, the girl had been asymptomatic with her mother and had received mixed breastfeeding.
Due to the clinical condition of the mother, who required care in a special unit, she was separated from her mother's daughter.
A newborn test for COVID-19 was also performed by RT-PCR in a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate (day 6 of birth).
Despite the negative result, the child was kept in isolation in the delivery room by the hospital staff until a second sample was obtained 36 h later (nasopharyngeal swabs (8 days after birth).
The newborn was transferred to the neonatology unit without additional tests, because she remained asymptomatic.
The patient was closely monitored, and on day 9 after birth he presented hyperpnea with mild intercostal retraction and two episodes of oxygen desaturation during deep sleep and feeding, which resolved spontaneously.
A capillary sample was obtained for dL gas protein, which revealed mild transient acidosis (pH 7.27; pCO2 49 mmHg; bicarbonate 22 mEq/L; base excess -4; normal lactate); a chest x-ray detected normal opacities.
After 24 h, symptoms subsided and the patient has remained asymptomatic until now (day 13 after birth), when RT-PCR for COVID-19 was repeated and remains positive.
Your mother is in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation.
