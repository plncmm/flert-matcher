Anamnesis A 46-year-old woman with a high intellectual level and no pathological history was referred to the Emergency Department for the first time because she had two seizures with seizures.
According to her husband, seizures began with disconnection, facial gestures, subsequent generalized stiffness and▁clonic movements of the four limbs and a post-critical period of about 15 minutes in each episode.
The previous four days she had presented a self-limiting influenza episode with no fever data, asthenia and increased▁daytime sleepiness but no behavioral changes.
Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient developed a seizure with decreased consciousness and hypotension, which required orotracheal intubation and inotropic support.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where bitemporal epicondential status was confirmed in the electroencephalographic record.
▁Phenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam, midazolam, pentotal and propofol were administered without achieving the electrical control of the seizures during 8 days of barbit compound.
Empirical antibiotic and antiviral treatment was established prior to performing a lumbar puncture.
Intravenous corticosteroids and immunoglobulins were administered without response.
After the addition of lacosamide to antiepileptic treatment day 8, the electrical status was controlled and the patient was extubated, showing absence of seizures.
She's admitted to the neurology ward for study.
Physical examination Patient alert, partially person oriented (only remember his name), disoriented in time and space.
No aphasia.
Marked anxiety and emotional lability
Important alteration of▁anterograde memory
Severe alteration of explicit memory (both semantic and episodic): unable to remember names, dates, places, faces, etc., related to one's own life or historical facts.
Moderate alteration of memory implicit recognition patterns: unable to remember walking and coordinated movements such as petechiae, dressing or brushing teeth without dysmetria.
Immediate and preserved fixation mechanism.
Judgment and reasoning were unaltered.
Neurological examination was normal.
▁Complementary tests • Serial video-electroencephalograms: during the first 8 days, there was evidence of destructured and slow background activity, with frequent discharges of origin in the corresponding bilateral myoclonus-frontal region.
On the eighth day of admission, the same diffuse brain involvement was recorded, with▁epileptiform anomalies but without discharges.
On day 10 pseudoperiodic complexes began to appear in temporal regions, which disappeared progressively in control electroencephalograms.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): on the third day of status▁epilepticus showed hyperintensity on FLAIR and on diffusion and hypointensity on ADC map in both hippocampus without gadolinium reinforcement
It shows hyperintensity in diffusion.
Dissemination restriction in the bilateral hippocampus on the third day of status change.
A one-month follow-up showed a decrease in hippocampal size compared to the initial MRI, with persistent hyperintensity in FLAIR, hyperintensity in FLAIR of periventricular claustrocampal development mild restriction similar to periventricular dissemination.
The image shows the size of the hippocampus on the third day of the status.Shows the reduction in the size of the hippocampus at 3 months of the acute process.
A follow-up MRI showed only hippocampal deformity.
• Cerebrospinal fluid study: glucose 99 mg/dl, proteins 43 mg/dl, leukocytes 6 cc/mm3.
Bacterial culture, bacterial infection and viral infection were negative.
ADA negative.
PCR negative for: enterovirus, Epstein-acquired virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes virus 6, West Nile virus, Toscana virus, varicella zoster virus, Jrelia virus B
• Special analysis: lactate 1.4 IU/l, negative tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG, carcase-globulin antigen, CA 125 antigen, CA 15-3 antigen, beta-2-microprotein).
Nonspecific 1/160 positive antinuclear antibodies.
Antimitochondrial antibodies and ANCA were negative.
Serum onconeuronal antibodies negative including anti-Hu, anti-NMDa, anti-NMDAR, anti-GA _BAR, anti-AMPAR, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2
• Serology: all negative (HIV 1/2, syphilis, Brucella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, hepatitis A, B and C virus).
• Cultures: hemocultive, urocultive, cultures of tracheal and rectal▁exudate negative.
• Body computed tomography: no pathological findings.
Diagnosis • Encephalitis ambiguous secondary to refractory status.
• Secondary Korsakoff syndrome.
Accreditation therapy:
Once again, the patient presents seizures with temporary partial seizures.
The spatial-temporal disorientation persists, although the memory deficit facilitates it, although with improvement in memory recalls it in everyday family members (sometimes close to complete memory), incomplete memory recalls its correct working memory.
Antegrade memory deficit persists with inability to acquire new knowledge.
