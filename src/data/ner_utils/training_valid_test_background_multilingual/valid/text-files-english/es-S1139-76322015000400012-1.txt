An 18-month-old girl who consulted for a tick bite on her head detected 24 hours before.
The mother believes that it could happen 3-4 days before, because they made a way out to the country (April months).
Domestic animals (dogs or other pets) did not live with them.
The tick was removed manually, and was about 5 mm in diameter.
On the day of the consultation, fever began and you noticed lumps in your head.
On examination, the patient was in good general condition, although irritable and somewhat declining.
In the left parie-occipital region, a vesicular eruption with a slight erythema diameter was observed.
The skull had multiple mastoid and cervical posterior diseases of small size between 1 and 1.5 cm in diameter, slightly painful to the adenopation.
The rest of the examination was normal and there were no rashes.
At first, an analytical test was requested to study tick bite and treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was recommended, thought about a possible overinfection of the sting.
Controlled later, protein binding persisted, lymphadenopathy and fever persisted. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SV) up to 20 mm/h
Malignant evolution of the clinical picture and suspected rickettsiosis, the case was consulted with the specialists in infectious diseases of our reference hospital and treatment with oral ciprofloxacin was decided, requesting a new analytical with serology
The patient is followed up a week later, with persistent fever and good evolution of lymphadenopathies, which return slowly, only a small area of alopecia of about 2 cm in diameter persists.
A decrease in leukocytosis and▁SV was observed in the control laboratory. The second serological test ten days later showed a titer of R. connori: IgG ≤ 1:40 and IgM 1:320.
No sample could be sent for study of R. slovaca.
At two months the child was asymptomatic and serology showed titers decreasing against R. connori IgG 1:40 and IgM ≤ 1:40.
