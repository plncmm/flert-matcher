A 61-year-old patient came to our hospital emergency department with a fever of 48 hours onset.
recent dental extraction with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis.
The patient had a history of mechanical aortic and mitral prosthesis after endocarditis due to Salmonella at 35 years of age, diagnosed after ischemic stroke of the left middle cerebral artery as the first manifestation, with residual hemiparesis and dysarthria.
Physical examination is anodyne.
Blood analysis showed C-reactive protein of 8.3, with the rest of the data normal.
Initially, hemocultives were extracted, which resulted negative and antibiotic therapy was prescribed due to the high suspicion of late infectious endocarditis on prosthetic valve.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed two periprosthetic leaks mitral stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, not present in previous echocardiograms.
Given the persistence of fever and the negativity of the first two hemocultive thalasses, the possibility of microorganisms causing endocarditis with negative hemocultives was raised, being positive PCR for Coxiella Icronicis phase (/3200 IgG).
PET-CT was performed, which showed no valvular uptake or other levels.
For this reason, intravenous treatment with hydroxychloroquine and amoxicillin was initiated empirically.
After 48 hours the fever disappeared and mitral valve replacement surgery was programmed, which was successfully performed and the valve extracted was sent to the laboratory, with PCR positive for Coxiella pronetii.
