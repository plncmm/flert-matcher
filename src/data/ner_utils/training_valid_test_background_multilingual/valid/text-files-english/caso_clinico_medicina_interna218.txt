A 75-year-old woman with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic venous insufficiency, angina, severe persistent bronchial asthma with chronically colonized bronchiectasis by multiresistant P. aeruginosa with frequent episodes of exacerbation.
He was treated with Omeprazole, Buprenorphine, Furosida, Hemovas, Theophylline, Montekast, Diltiam, Rano titropium, bromisuro/ inhaled.
It is characterized by generalized abdominal pain with predominance in the right flank of one day of evolution, fever of 38oC and nausea without accompanying vomiting or other associated symptoms.
Acceptable general condition, eupneic, tachycardic and aphasia.
Cardiopulmonary arrest with biannual crepitants and roncus ̄s.
Globulous abdomen, blandom and depressible, painful to diffuse constipation and with greater intensity at the right flank level.
Extremities with signs of venous insufficiency
▁Complementary tests Analytical with Hb 13.6g/dl; leukocytosis000/mcl with neutrophil; normal platelets; hyperpigmentation 21.68ogenl; Creatinine 1mg/dl; urea7.6mg/dl.
Abdominal X-ray showed dilated loops with no evidence of obstruction.
Abdominal tomography with suggestive findings of infectious process / ascending colon / hepatic angle.
Parenteral stricture prescribed empirical antibiotic therapy Piperacillin/T.
Search was performed because of the presence of active bleeding and clots with secondary anaemia requiring transfusion of hemoconcentrates.
Pathological findings consistent with suspected ischemic colitis in the right colon were repeated and a biopsy of the lesion was performed.
Subsequently, due to good clinical evolution, a low residue diet and nutritional supplements with good tolerance is reintroduced.
Histopathological results were obtained with▁immunohistochemical confirmation of colitis due to▁Cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Serology was also obtained for CMV with IgM positive and IgG 33.
It was decided to start oral treatment with Valganvir orally administered 900mg every 12 days, following a completely asymptomatic follow-up.
Based on the clinical features, differential diagnosis was made with abdominal, inflammatory, tumoral and ischemic infectious processes.
The diagnosis was obtained by biopsy.
Treatment should be supportive and antiviral against CMV.
