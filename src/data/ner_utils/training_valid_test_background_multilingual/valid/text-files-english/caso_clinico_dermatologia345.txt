Anamnesis A 72-year-old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism and anxiety-depressive syndrome was referred to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation of painful skin lesions of five days of evolution associated with dysthermic discomfort.
Twenty-four hours before, she had started empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 2 grams every 24 hours and Clindamycin 600 milligrams every 8 hours.
Physical examination The patient was febrile, with a temperature of 37.8 oC and hemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 143/63 mmHg and heart rate of 73 beats per minute.
The patient presented an erythematous plaque, slightly pale, with vesicles and blisters with serous content on the surface, occupying the entire right auricular and external auditory canal, the mandibular arch and the right lateral cervical region.
In the trunk, upper limbs and roots of lower limbs, he had erythematous▁papules with central vesicle in number greater than 100.
On neurological examination, deviation of the labial commissure with a smile to the left and a slight inability to complete closure of the right upper eyelid were noteworthy.
▁Complementary tests The hemogram showed the absence of leukocytosis, a mild▁lymphopenia and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes.
In the basic biochemistry, a slight increase in creatinine not present in previous studies, a slight hypertransaminasemia, with an increase in AST higher than in TPG, and a slight decrease in total proteins were observed.
Microbiological examination of the gallbladder fluid revealed a positive PCR for herpes zoster.
Blood cultures were negative.
Diagnosis: Multimetameric herpes zoster, with right C2 and C3 dermatomes, and disseminated with associated peripheral facial paralysis (liver disease-related enolic disorder, chronic malnutrition syndrome).
Treatment Intravenous therapy with indinavir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/8 hours was administered and maintained for ten days. Treatment was associated with serum therapy, analgesic treatment and systemic descending corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day regimen
Daily local cures were prescribed with copper sulfate stimulation at 1/1000.
The patients condition improved clinically, with disappearance of fever and decrease in pain 24-48 hours after the start of treatment.
The lesions improved paulatinely, leaving only residual lesions after 15 days.
Mild facial paralysis persisted.
In search of possible neoplasias or other immunodepressant diseases that could have triggered the picture, a computerized tomography of the whole body was performed, where no masses or lymphadenopathies of significant size were observed.
HIV serology was negative.
