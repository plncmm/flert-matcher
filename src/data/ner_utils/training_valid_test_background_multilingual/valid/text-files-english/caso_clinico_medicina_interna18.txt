A 72-year-old woman with hypertension treated with candesart√°n, with a history of ischaemic stroke with partial motor crises secondary to treatment with ASA, atorvastatin and lamotrigine accompanied by non-radiological signs of mechanical low back pain, was admitted due to emergency.
Initially she was treated with NSAIs without improvement, reaching bedridden.
Gastrointestinal symptoms or other associated symptoms.
On physical examination, only obesity and a painful, stony mass with inflammatory signs associated with left lumbar fossa were found. Laboratory tests revealed mild anemia (Hb 10 g/dl) normocytic, leukocytosis (mild reactive protein 12600 mg).
A simple x-ray of the left lumbar spine showed posterior fixation of the soft gas in the region posterior to L2-L3 level. The mass was extended from the retroperitoneal muscle wall to the subcutaneous tissue and a cellular abscess was observed.
Adjacent to the mass, diverticular images were observed in the left colon and sigmoid with a segment of mural thickening, thinning and a fistulous tract.
Additionally, multiple images of hypodense spleen were observed, compatible with abscesses and small bilateral pleural effusion.
The diagnosis of acute perforated diverticulum with a fixed accrual was established by placement of a catheter under CT control for percutaneous drainage, purulent material was sent to microbiology.
Blood cultures were negative, whereas abscess culture was positive for aerobic and anaerobic polymicrobe flora, compatible with fecal matter.
She received broad-spectrum antibiotics with Piperacillin-Tazon for 4 weeks with good tolerance and no side effects.
In subsequent control microbiological cultures, more resistant microorganisms were isolated between polymicrobe flora, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and C. albicans, as a consequence of the antibiotic pressure phenomenon.
The clinical evolution was favorable, maintaining the aphid and asymptomatic, allowing reintroduction and progress in oral tolerance.
In the subsequent imaging control, no purulent collection was observed, although a fistulatous colo-cutaneous path persists, currently under outpatient follow-up pending surgical intervention for suppuration months after hospital discharge.
