She was delivered by emergency cesarean section at 33 weeks of gestation due to maternal complications.
The child was born in poor health.
She was intubated, underwent tensiotherapy and ventilation for 72 hours.
Then he was extubated and transferred to a high flow rate consolidation until the 5th day of life.
On day 9 of life, her condition worsened, with poor tolerance to food and respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation.
A chest X-ray showed patchy consolidations of the right middle zone and perihilar region, suggestive of infection.
Blood test results revealed a slight increase in C-reactive protein to 14 mg/L (normal value < 10 mg/L) and an increase in the number of thrombocytes.
Due to this clinical deterioration and the results obtained, treatment with IV antibiotics was started.
Respiratory secretions were negative for influenza, respiratory nonspecific virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and paragripal virus, but a RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive.
Parents had not presented signs of disease indicative of COVID-19 during the previous 14 days and reported no contact with other people suffering from suicidal thoughts of COVID-19.
The newborn was isolated and protected with the recommended personal protective equipment, until later tests of IDWCO from smears were negative on day 12.
A five-day regimen of IV antibiotics was established.
Parents were asked to stay confined for 14 days; they remained in good health during this time.
