Personal history A 38-year-old male, born in Peru and living in Spain for five years.
Habitual smoker and occasional drinker also occasionally consumed other toxics by inhaled route.
The patient had an HIV infection diagnosed in his country in 2002, category C3.
He had been followed up at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal up to a year before, when he became infected with Sevilla and abandoned follow-up.
Until then, he had been treated with emtricitabine, tenofovir and lopinavir/ritonavir, with irregular compliance, and in the last review he had a figure of 124 CD4+ and CV lower than 50 copies/mL.
He had been diagnosed with facial and dorsal Kaposi's sarcoma in 2007 and had had several genital herpes sprouts.
In 2002 (although in Peru) he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, being treated for 6-9 months, unaware of the regimen used.
In 2007 she had a relapse, and at this time she was treated with disseminated multi-resistant tuberculosis with abdominal location (localization of the bile and peritoneum), mediastinal and joint (right clavicular joint).
He was treated with prothionamide, PAS and levofloxacin for one year.
The patient was treated conservatively with cotrimoxazole.
Current illness progressed five months after Sevilla's arrival due to persistent and progressive subacute headache, without fever, with occasional episodes of disconnection with the environment, with immediate recovery.
Physical examination The patient was in good general condition, well nourished and had no significant palpable lymph nodes.
There were no changes in cardiopulmonary auscultation or abdominal examination.
Hypopigmented lesions in the left hemisphere and dorsal region stood out, which were interpreted as residual lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma.
There was no focal deficit in the neurological examination and the upper functions were preserved.
▁Complementary laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, 6,000 leukocytes/μL, 78% neutrophils, 920 total lymphocytes/μL, 76 CD4+/μL.
Biochemistry showed urea 53 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, potassium 5.2 mEq/L, LDH 536 U/L, total cholesterol 205 mg/dL.
The rest of the biochemical parameters were normal.
Chest X-ray showed no significant changes.
HIV viral load was less than 50 copies; antitoxoplasma IgG serology 1.5 U/L, cryptococcal antigen negative in CSF and all hemocultives were negative.
The CT and MRI showed a single hypodense lesion in the left parietal region of 3x2 cm, which after intravenous contrast injection.
showed peripheral enhancement and significant mass effect.
Diagnostic test A stereotactic biopsy of the mass was performed.
In the samples obtained in this biopsy, multiple acid-alcohol resistant bacilli were observed, which was later confirmed in the culture that was Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resistant to all first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.
Clinical case Abscess brain due to multiresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Sepsis was initiated with empirical treatment consisting of measuring tape and pyramidal toxoplasmosis, with no response.
After obtaining the result of the biopsy, treatment with prothionamide, PAS and levofloxacin was restarted, which the patient had abandoned months ago.
Despite this, the patient's condition deteriorated, with continuous transgress in treatment by the patient, requiring multiple admissions due to repeated seizures, dying epicardial effusion in a situation of status.
