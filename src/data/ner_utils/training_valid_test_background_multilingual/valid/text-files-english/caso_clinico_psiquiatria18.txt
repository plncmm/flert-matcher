Current disease initiates cannabis use in adolescence, mainly at weekends, in order to maintain daily consumption in adulthood at a ratio of 2-3 pigs/day, usually at night, in order to "relate".

The patient clearly related cannabis withdrawal, and went back to the Emergency Department.
During the following weeks, anxiety appears regarding the possibility of repeating the crises, with concern for their consequences, their inability to reduce consumption without presenting, and their difficulty to focus on the study.

This epigraph covers disorders in which cannabis use can be identified as directly responsible for the clinical picture that contributes to this situation, but in those who do not find sufficient guidelines to be included in any of the previous disorders.
We can make the differential diagnosis with "panic disorder (episodic paroxysmal anxiety) F41.0".
Its essential feature is the presence of recurrent severe anxiety crises (panic) not limited to any particular situation or set of circumstances.
They are therefore unpredictable.
As in other anxiety disorders, the predominant symptoms are as follows:
▁Almost always lose secondary care to die, control, or freak.
Each seizure usually lasts only a few minutes, but may also last longer.
Both the frequency and course of the disorder, which▁predominates in women, are quite variable.
Often fear and vegetative symptoms of the attack grow so that those who suffer from them end up leaving, to whom they find themselves.
A panic attack is often followed by a persistent fear of having another panic attack.
However, we should not perform this diagnosis per se, since they are not unpredictable, but appear secondary to abstinence from the substance.
Treatment Clonazepam 2.5 mg/day was administered in three doses and sertraline up to 200 mg/day in two doses.
A psychotherapeutic program was included, with detailed information on false beliefs when misinterpreting moderate body sensations as indicative of a panic crisis, real information about them, and controlled relaxation techniques were included.
After improving her baseline level of anxiety, she did not present panic crisis when she abandoned cannabis and restarted her job tasks, the patient abandoned treatment after 2 months.
A year later, the family reports that it has occasionally returned to consuming cannabis with its new partner.
He has not had any new crises at present.
