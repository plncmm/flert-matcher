Anamnesis A 41-year-old male with no history of interest, or previous headache, who consulted for acute headache of five days duration.
The patient described a bitemporal, intense, pulsatile, non-explosive predominance associated with neck pain, which appeared fundamentally when standing up, adding symptoms with clear decubitus and vomiting.
The previous days, the patient had presented with a catarrhal condition, and the only possible triggering factor for headache was having been performing forced nasal cleaning maneuvers moments before the onset of the clinical picture.
Physical examination revealed features consistent with facial palsy and an anodyne, except for mild▁rigidity of the final neck, with no other signs of meningeal irritation.
Neurological examination showed no relevant findings.
The patient's intolerance to sitting and standing was observed, so that a few minutes after leaving the decubitus position a feeling of dizziness was triggered with intense vasovagal symptoms described accompanying the headache.
▁Complementary tests • Basic laboratory tests and an electrocardiogram were requested in the emergency department, as well as a cranial computed tomography (CT) that showed no abnormalities.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and angio-MRI performed during admission showed signs of sinusitis only, but also signs of left maxillary sinusitis.
• Given the clear relationship between the clinical picture and orthostatism, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypotension syndrome was diagnosed, performing a lumbar puncture that showed severe hypotension.
• At the same time, the study was completed with an isotopic cisternography, which finally confirmed the presence of several fistulous tracts of paraspinal cerebrospinal fluid, leading to a marked progression of multiple oral fistulae low
Treatment and evolution diagnosis of severe liquoral hypotension syndrome, symptomatic measures consisting of absolute bed rest and analgesic therapy were adopted.
Serotherapy was initiated with hyperosmolar solutions and caffeine diet was prescribed as treatment for liquor hypotension.
The patient had a very good clinical evolution, progressively▁tolerating sitting and standing, with a paulatine disappearance of headache and vegetative episodes, reason why it was decided to continue with conservative measures at home.
Diagnosis Severe cerebrospinal fluid hypotension syndrome secondary to spontaneous cervical-dorsal dural fistula triggered by Valsalva maneuver.
