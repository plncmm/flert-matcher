A 50-year-old male, without known drug allergies, ex-smoker for 7 years, with an accumulated consumption of 30 pack-years and without other accompanying toxic habits.
His personal history included highly poorly controlled insulin diabetes mellitus with target organ involvement (diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; amputation of several lower limb phalanges (LLL)).
A previous admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in 2010 with clinical judgment at discharge of pneumonia and diabetic ketoacidosis complicated with secondary septic shock stood out.
The usual treatment consists of insulin glargine 30 IU/day, insulin aspart according to daily needs and▁acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day.
The patient was sent to the hospital when he was found by unconscious relatives at home.
He had not taken the insulin for three days on his own account.
For 48 hours, the patient had been feeling thirsty, nausea and vomiting.
Physical examination revealed poor general condition with a severe decrease in the level of consciousness (Glasgow 9/15 points) as well as dryness and mucocutaneous stiffness.
The patient was eupneic at rest, with 98% oxygen saturation with nasal accelerators, accompaniment 2 with nasal accelerators, TA 74/47 mmHg, tapering 48 bpm
Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal.
No significant lymphadenopathies were detected.
There were no edemas or signs of peripheral venous thrombosis in the lower limbs or skin lesions.
The following complementary tests were performed: electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 50 bpm, with no changes in QRS or repolarization.
The blood count showed 12,300 leukocytes per microliter and 88% neutrophils; the rest of the series were normal.
In the biochemical analysis, the following were noteworthy: blood glucose 1083 mg/dl with glycated hemoglobin 9.3%; acute renal failure with creatinine at 4 mg/dl (GFR 16 mL/min/1.732 mEq/ml), normal creatinine
The coagulation study was normal.
HIV serology was negative.
Urine samples showed ketonuria and glycosuria marked with positive sentinel bodies (50mg/ dl).
Urine toxicology was negative.
Venous gas showed metabolic acidosis with pH <6.8, pCO2 32 mmHg, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L and lactic acidosis in 15.2 mmol/L.
Chest X-ray revealed a well-defined alveolar infiltrate in the right base, with blurring of the cardiac limit.
In the right upper lobe there is another less dense and more diffuse infiltrate.
There was no associated pleural effusion.
No significant alterations were observed in conventional cranial computed tomography (CT).
The patient was admitted with mechanical ventilation in the ICU with the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and suspicion of pneumonia.
She was treated with fluid therapy, insulin infusion, and intravenous infusions of 1g/24 hours (iv).
A BAS was performed by flexible▁bronchoscopy (FB) and a new chest X-ray was performed, which revealed a new nodular alveolar infiltrate in the left upper lobe.
Subsequently, a random CT scan was requested, showing multiple pulmonary nodules, some cavitated, up to 18-20 mm, in both lung fields, predominantly in the upper lobes and most significantly in the periphery of them, local.
In addition, small bilateral pleural effusion, minimal in left hemithorax.
Abdominal examination was unremarkable.
Differential diagnosis For the differential diagnosis we must assess the diseases that cause cavitated lesions in the lung.
Some of them would be: 1. Neoplasms: Primary lung tumors are usually single cavitated lesions, spiculated, with thick and irregular walls.
They are frequently associated with soft tissue involvement or other findings such as lymphadenopathy, mediastinal invasion or non-disordered chest wall.
They are usually chronic (> 12 weeks).
The acute appearance of our clinical picture, as well as the multiple affectation does not make us consider this option as a first possibility.
Neither is the choice of metastasis, since there is no evidence of primary tumor in CT-abdominal as well as its presentation is chronic.
Some types of lymphomas may also present with cavitated lesions, but our patient does not present b symptoms or adenopathies, findings very suggestive of this entity.
Another possibility would be Kaposi's Sarcoma, but it is typical of patients with HIV infection and in the presence of skin lesions, both characteristics absent in this case, and therefore we do not consider this option.
2. Autoimmune disease: It▁encompasses a group of diseases that can cause, although rarely, pulmonary lesions similar to our case.
Granulomatosis must be ruled out with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) which is a necrotizing systemic vasculitis affecting the upper, lower and renal respiratory tracts.
The form of presentation is usually chronic and progressive, therefore, the sudden onset of symptoms in our patient with decreased level of consciousness diverts us from this entity.
Sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis because when pulmonary nodules appear, they can cavitate.
The most common presentation is usually by hiliar lymphadenopathy that does not exist in our patient, in the same way that it does not present a clinical, analytical alteration (hypercalcemia, ACE) or radiological involvement (interstitial sarcoidosis).
3. Pulmonary embolism: Pulmonary embolism of vascular origin cavitary exceptionally in 7% of cases, so it is unlikely that it is the cause of our clinical case.
There are also pulmonary cavitations in cases of septic pulmonary embolisms.
They could be a possibility to consider because they present acutely as multiple small nodules, peripheral and subpleural location, as in our patient.
However, the absence of fever and murmurs in cardiac auscultation, as well as the absence of the etiology of this entity (endothelial bacterial meningitis), patients with suspected pulmonary fibrosis, septic shock or septic shock are suggestive of thrombosis.
4. Infectious pathology: Most cavitated lung lesions appear as a complication of aspiration pneumonia caused by anaerobic germs in patients with some predisposing factor such as low level of consciousness.
This was our main initial suspicion, but the lack of response to empirical treatment with sildenafil and tadalafil 1g/24 hours iv ruled out this option.
other cavitary bacteria can cause pulmonary cavitations, but they do so less frequently and also respond to treatment with indinavir and penicillin usually cause: Klebsiella pneumoniae, severe necrotizing pneumonia that usually coalesce in a large cavity and produce Staphylococcus aureus.
Therefore, infections secondary to antibiotic-resistant bacterial organisms had to be considered.
The infection secondary to Actinomyces sp is associated with poor oral hygiene and is more frequently located in the face and neck skin.
Non-immunosuppressed immunity affects mainly immunosuppressed patients with cell deficiency.
These reasons led us to rule out these infections in our patient.
In more than 90% of cases, mycobacterial infection corresponds to the reactivation of a latent infection, with a chronic onset, not as in our patient that appears acutely.
In addition, clinical (absence of lymphadenopathy and hemoptysis) and epidemiology do not guide us to this diagnosis as a first possibility.
The lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy in a poorly controlled diabetic patient with cavitation leads us to suspect secondary pulmonary infections (aspergillosis and mucormycosis) as the first possibility.
▁Pneumonia secondary to Aspergillus sp manifests in neutropenic patients who have received multiple cycles of antibiotics or in patients with chronic corticosteroid therapy, findings not present in our patient.
Mucor sp. infection, however, manifests in patients similar to our case, with diabetes mellitus and poor metabolic control that course with diabetic ketosis.
Although its most common involvement is rhino-orbital-cerebral, it can also cause pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement in others.
Pulmonary mucormycosis presents as a nodular lung disease very severe and rapidly progressive, with a high probability of cavitation.
This is consistent with our clinical case and therefore with our differential diagnosis.
Chest wall thickness was measured as a result of chest CT scan to treat liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day iv.
After bronchoaspiration (BAS), Mucor sp was isolated and unseptated wide hyphae with irregular branches were cultured, so liposomal amphotericin B was maintained.
Brain and otorhinolaryngological involvement by Mucor was ruled out by CT.
During admission to the ICU, the patient required intubation for 9 days and developed tracheal intubation during the first 72 hours after administration of noradrenaline.
On the twelfth day, the patient was stable with normalization of renal function, without acidosis and blood glucose 203 mg/dl, so he was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit.
None of the patients presented clinical signs of pulmonary involvement.
During hospitalization, the clinical and laboratory evolution was favorable with liposomal amphotericin B for a total of 40 days (normalization of blood glucose and pH values).
The radiological evolution was slower, with a slight decrease in pulmonary lesions.
At discharge, treatment with oral posaconazole (300 mg/day) was followed by the persistence, to a lesser extent, of the pulmonary lesions. The patient continued to follow up visits to the pulmonary infiltrate clinic with complete resolution of the pulmonary infiltrate.
Final diagnosis Pulmonary mucormycosis in diabetic patient controlled with severe hyperglycemia and diabetic ketosis.
