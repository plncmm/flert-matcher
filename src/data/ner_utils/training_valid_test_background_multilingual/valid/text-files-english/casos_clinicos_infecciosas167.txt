A 58-year-old male with no relevant past medical history who had been diagnosed with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) type I with positive anti-glomerular basal▁gangrene antibodies two months prior to hospital admission.
The clinical picture presented as fever of non-infectious origin and acute renal failure.
She received induction treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis, and continued maintenance treatment with prednisone (60 mg daily) and prophylactic cotrimoxazole (160/800 mg every other day).
Despite this, renal function had not improved and was undergoing regular hemodialysis through a tunneled right jugular central venous catheter (CVC).
She was admitted to the Nephrology Department due to an intermittent fever of up to 39oC of about three weeks of evolution, for which she had been treated with cefazolin without improvement.
In the three days prior to admission, the patient presented with diarrhea without pathological products, abdominal colic pain and nausea.
The physical examination showed good general condition despite fever and was normohydrated and normotensive.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal, abdomen was blushing, with no signs of peritoneal irritation and CVC showed no signs of infection of the orifice or tunnel.
There were no skin lesions, lymphadenopathies or neurological focality.
Urgent blood tests were requested, highlighting normocytic normochromic anemia (10.7 g/dl of hemoglobin), leucopenia (2.420 leukocytes/μl) with predominance of neutrophils (89/000 platelets/μl).
There was an increase in acute phase reactants with C-reactive protein (CRP) of 85.1 mg/l.
Ferritin was 235 ng/ml and transaminases bilirubin and pancreatic enzymes were normal.
Hemocultivation by peripheral vein and CVC were negative, as well as by coprocultive, with Clostridium difficile toxin positive in▁faeces.
Treatment with metronidazole was started with clinical improvement and diarrhea disappeared.
Fever persisted in spite of this, and fever persisted, with a decrease in the three series: 770 leukocytes/μL with 450 neutrophils/μL, 69,000 platelets/9.5 mgL and haemoglobin
Polymerase chain reaction in plasma of cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6, 7 and 8, Epstein-style virus and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were requested.
CMV viral load was positive, with 9.39x106 IU/ml being detected, with negative results for the rest of the analyzed viruses. Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir was initiated with doses adjusted to renal function.
Endoscopy showed gastric and duodenal ulcers, which were sampled for pathological anatomy and for study by polymerase chain reaction CMV, the latter being positive (754,000 IU/ml).
At this time, the patient met criteria for hemophagoc syndrome (HPS), since he had fibrinogen, cits, quinine elevated ferritin 2ml/ hormone 1), elevated triglycerides (dl-interferon) and low U-dL.
Aspiration and bone marrow biopsy were performed, without evidence of neoplasia or hemophagocytosis in the biopsy, although there were few signs of the latter in the extensions of the mycobacteria pending for a culture of peripheral blood.
FAS was considered secondary to CMV infection and, after 14 days of treatment with hypersensitivity hemoglobin, fever improved in the patient's general condition, although the neutrophils persisted at 10μg/μg: 400μg
platelet count, severe bacteraemia, colony stimulating factor 9 and immunoglobulin treatment was decided upon, with a mixed approach to toxicity due to ganvir and neutrophils/μg/dl, with improvement in platelet count and white blood cell count.
After this, the fever reappeared, this time with associated respiratory symptoms (all without expectoration), observing in the chest X-ray a nodular image in the right upper lobe (RUL) that did not exist previously CT.
CT described the presence of a 21 x 16.7 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the anterior segment of the LSD, with irregular borders, as well as micronodules in a "bolus" pattern.
Differential diagnosis For the differential diagnosis, we will discuss below those pathologies that course with the appearance of pulmonary nodules, especially those that may present with a "in-bud" pattern associated1-3.
Broncholoalveolar carcinoma or metastases may present with this pattern, although the rapid onset and the infectious clinical manifestations make this diagnosis unlikely.
We could also think of a pulmonary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that may manifest with pulmonary nodules and course with fever, but again, the appearance and growth of nodules in a short time makes us think about inflammatory or infectious etiologies.
Some autoimmune diseases may present with this pattern, such as sarcoidosis, drug hypersensitivity pneumonitis (the 2 cm pulmonary nodule does not support this diagnosis), pneumoconiosis (the patient had no history of granulomatous vasculitis or other Weurus).
What our patient is undergoing treatment for their underlying nephropathy goes against an autoimmune origin.
Several bacterial infections by microorganisms such as Legionella, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia psittaci or Mycoplasma can cause this type of infiltrate and fever.
However, these are usually a cause of community-acquired pneumonia and are not expected after prolonged hospitalization.
Again, the presence of a well-defined nodule would go against these etiologies.
The baseline clinical status of the patient (thyroid immunosuppression) and CMV infection (immunodepressant infectious agent predisposed the patient to infections with other slowly growing viruses, corticosteroids, or constipation.
It could be thought that CMV was also affecting the lung, since it can cause pulmonary nodules and the patient had had high viremia with intestinal involvement, but the improvement after treatment with unlikely tapering was made.
Opportunistic fungal infection seemed to be a more than reasonable option.
Histoplasma, Blastomyces and Coccidiodes were discarded because they were not endemic in our country.
Aspergillus, cystis patient jirovecii and Cryptococcus are more common in our environment and cause pneumonia in the immunosuppressed that usually courses as subacute as in ours.
In favor of an Aspergillus infection, we had the patient who was immunosuppressed by corticosteroids, neutropenia and previous CMV infection, without the lack of cavitation of the detected nodule being able to rule out the etiology of this infection.
Although nodular forms are described in P. jirovecii infection, prophylactic treatment with cotrimoxazole and the absence of interstitial infiltrates contradict this diagnosis.
Cryptococcus can present with pulmonary nodules, although the central nervous system involvement in the form of meningitis is the most common in immunocompromised patients.
Not recognized is a microorganism to be considered in immunosuppressed patients.
Prolonged fever, glucocorticoid treatment, and neutropenia are favorable for diagnosis.
However, the most common presentation is cavitated nodules and, in addition, the patient had received prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, which is usually effective against this bacterium.
Tuberculosis deserves special mention since it can occur in multiple forms and we should take it into account in almost any differential diagnosis.
Lung nodules and the tree-in-bud pattern may coexist in this condition, which would have been evident after immunosuppression.
Sepsis was performed in a fibrobronchoscopy in which samples were taken for culture of bacteria, mycobacteria for determinations and negative immunofluorescence for P. jvcii, determination except for bacterial culture slope and direct smear microscopy.
Because of this, we request puncture and aspiration with needle (PAAF) and CT-guided core needle biopsy (BAG).
While waiting for the results, the patient worsened due to dyspnea on minimal exertion.
Analytical analysis revealed a new severe neutrophil/μl with 66,000/μl and hemoglobin of 1 g/dl, and the appearance of data on colostrum (918 thrombocytopenia, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, respectively).
A new chest CT scan showed the persistence of the nodule in LSD without changes in size and an increase in the number of millimetric nodules, with a change in the radiological pattern to a miliary pattern with extensive involvement of all lung segments.
At these times we received the results of the pending microbiological tests.
Blood culture for mycobacteria and cultures for these microorganisms from FNAB of the pulmonary nodule and bone marrow aspirate were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The patient continued to lower the dose of steroid to 20 mg/ day, starting treatment with tuberculous agents (isicide, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and etambuco).
Suddenly, the patient suffered a clinical picture of melenic depositions with hemodynamic repercussion, so an urgent digestive endoscopy was performed, finding perforated bleeding ulcer at the level of the second portion of the duodenal shock.
Final diagnosis▁Cytomegalovirus disease in immunosuppressed patient with high viremia, gastroduodenal ulcers and secondary hemophagocytic syndrome.
Disseminated with bacteremia, pulmonary and bone marrow involvement and probably hepatic cholestasis (disordered tuberculosis).
Hypovolemic shock secondary to duodenal ulcer perforation.
