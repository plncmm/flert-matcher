Female patient, 60 years old, resident in Mexico City.
He was admitted to the Hospital de la Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social Mexican Institute of Social Security in Mexico City, in February 2017, referred from another hospital with a diagnosis of probable cardiology.
The patient had fever of unknown origin, intermittent, up to 39.7 °C, accompanied by diaphoresis and chills of 24 months duration, as well as vegetations on the aortic valve demonstrated by echocardiography.
According to Duke's criteria, it was concluded that the etiology of the condition was unknown.
The patient had a smoking history of 1.5 packs/year, occasional alcoholism without reaching the mouth and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in 2012, treated with 2.5 mg/24 hours of prednisone 150 mg/24 hours, and▁cyclosporine 100 mg/24 hours.
In the Hospital de Cardiologia, the following studies were performed: transthoracic echocardiography (ECOTT) and transesophageal echocardiography (ECOTE), corroborating the existence of two vegetations in the aortic valve demonstrated the presence of hepatomegaly gamma probe.
Laboratory tests that included blood biometry, blood chemistry, coagulation times, blood group, immunology and hemocultives showed the following results: normocytic normochromic anemia that ranged from 122 x thrombocytopenia, IgG 118.73/ 8.2 and IgG + 3
The rest of the studies were within normal reference ranges.
Three hemocultives were performed, all of them stained with BacT/ALERT® 3D system, which showed no microbiological growth.
Although cefcardiac concussions caused by the prescribed method were negative, the patient was diagnosed with amikacin according to the criteria for treatment of intracardiac vegetations (<10 mm), and vancomycin was administered according to the clinical and imaging criteria.
In the control echocardiogram performed at the end of February, it was observed that the vegetations had increased their diameter: one average 14 x 8 mm and the other 4 x 5 mm, so in March 2017 aortic valve implantation was performed.
The patient was discharged from the Hospital de Cardiologia in April 2017, with treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, in addition, acetyl salicylic acid and metoprolol.
During their hospital stay, as part of a research protocol, a manual blood test was performed using the lysis-centrifugation method, which, according to previous publications, increases the isolation of collagen.
From the sediment obtained with this technique, a white, philamentous and cotton-like colony was developed, whose direct examination with cotton blue showed septate hyaline philations, with vesicular cells in the same chain.
The absence of morphological structures that guided their identification, resorted to molecular biology procedures.
DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (ExgeneTM Plant SV, Gene All, Biotechnology CO, Korea), following the manufacturer's instructions.
The ITS-D1D2 region was amplified by PCR, with ITS1 (5"-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3") and ITS4 (5"-TCCTCCGCTTATTG) primers.
PCR was performed with 100 ng DNA, 96 °C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 30 seconds.
The amplification product was 620 base pairs (bp), which was purified and sequenced.
The sequence received was compared in the Genebank database, yielding 100% identity with Histoplasma capsulatum (Sequence ID: KX646015.1).
It is important to mention that the fungal development of the hemocultive with the lysis-centrifugation technique occurred after the patient had been informed.
The histopathological study of the vegetations, with PAS and Gtados stainings and diameter approximately performed by the Department of Pathological Anatomy of the Hospital de Cardiologia, showed the presence of two types of mycotic structures row length of 5 μm.
The patient was treated with itraconazole, 300 mg/day.
To date, no alterations suggestive of persistent infection have been observed in quarterly reviews.
