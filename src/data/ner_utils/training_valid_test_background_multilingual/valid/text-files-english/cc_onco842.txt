Anamnesis An 81-year-old diabetic patient, with a history of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and active smoker, who began with pain and edema of the left lower limb, was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis Rivaroxa Pushler.
A few days later, he came to the clinic again due to dyspnea of several days of evolution, associated with cough without expectoration and without chest pain.
CT angiography was performed in the emergency room due to suspicion, confirming a defect in repletion of the lingular artery compatible with colitis.
In addition, CT shows significant axillary/left-sided retropia (18 and 20 mm), with significant inferior to prevascular malignancy as well as lymph node enlargement 10 mm, short segment adenoLM).
Due to these results, she was admitted to Internal Medicine for further study.
During admission, the evolution is favorable, asymptomatic from the respiratory point of view.
A battery of complementary tests was performed to determine the presence of CT anomalies. Among these, general laboratory tests with markers were performed, without observing significant tumoral adenopathy (EPV11, hyper-pulmonary focus), which coincided with left adeno-thorax (TCS), 14
Small hypermetabolic focus (SUVmax▁3.9) of the left retroparotid artery that could correspond to another subcentimetric adenopathy.
Because of these PET/CT results, it was decided to consult with General Surgery for axillary lymph node biopsy.
The anatomopathological results of axillary biopsy correspond to lymph node metastasis of poorly differentiated carcinoma with comdonecrosis.
The▁immunohistochemical study of tumor cells shows negativity for CK20, TTF1, PSA, GATA3, S100 and p40, and cannot establish the origin of the primary tumor.
These findings are due to the fact that they are not valued.
Painless, Patient with a performance status (PS) of 1, with normal cardiorespiratory auscultation, rhythmic tone without audible murmurs, vesicular murmur conserved without buccoyant abdomen.
No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy was found.
On inspection, signs of DVT were observed in the left lower limb.
▁Complementary tests Tumor markers performed: alpha-fetoprotein, CA 15.3, CA 19.9, CA 72.4, neuronal specific enolase and PSA.
All of them showed no relevant alterations except CEA, which showed a clear decrease since diagnosis.
» CEA: 327,5 (performed on 5/06/2017) >> 132,8 (performed on 7/08/2017) >> 59,7 (performed on 19 August/2018).
PET-CT performed during follow-up.
» Initial PET-CT, performed in June 2017, already described in the anamnesis.
» PET-CT in November/2017: stable lymph node metastases except cytoreduction in the left axilla.
No other foci are identified.
» PET-CT in February/2018: lymph nodes suggestive of lymph node metastasis in remission.
No new foci of tumor activity are identified.
Infectious immunodiagnosis » Serology performed in August/2017: hepatitis virus negative except IgG and IgM for hepatitis A virus positive.
» Serology performed in February/2018: hepatitis virus negative except IgG and IgM for hepatitis A and E virus positive.
Diagnosis Lymph node metastases (left rhinolaryngoid, mediastinal and left axillary) of poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown origin.
Treatment of these outcomes offers the patient the possibility of initiating chemotherapy treatment with the chemotherapy scheme paclitaxel, the first line of tumors of unknown origin, but the patient refuses treatment and wishes only follow-up.
During follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic.
Denies changes in your lifestyle or diet.
The complementary tests showed a clear spontaneous regression of the tumor.
This fact is observed in PET-CT images and in the marked decrease in tumor markers.
As an incidental finding, seroconversion of hepatitis A and E virus is observed, without clinical repercussions (there is no febrile syndrome or associated symptoms), or analytical (without increase in acute phase reactants, or elevation of transaminase).
Due to the results of the tests and the clinical status of the patient, it is proposed to continue monitoring.
A two-month visit was established with laboratory tests and tumor markers.
