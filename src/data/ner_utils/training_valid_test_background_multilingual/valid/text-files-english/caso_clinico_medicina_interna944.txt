A 38-year-old man, Bulgarian, with risky sex.
She was admitted due to progressive dyspnea, cough and constitutional picture of two months of evolution.
On arrival, there was a bilateral interstitial infiltrate in X-ray, without leukocytosis, positive serology for HIV with CD4 15 (1.7%) and viral load 5.77 log, Mantoux <5mm, negative IFN gamma.
Sputum▁eosinophils were performed with positive immunofluorescence for cystis jirovecii and AFB was not observed.
Viremia of 650IU/ml of CMV in plasma was detected.
suspected CMV infection bycystis and viremia due to CMV, was treated for 21 days with intravenous cotrimoxazole, ganciclovir and corticotherapy, with resolution of the respiratory symptoms and radiological normalization.
On day 14 of initiating cotrimoxazole, the patient began suffering from Triumeq®.
Twenty-four hours after oral prophylactic co-trimoxazole was sequenced, the patient was still on HAART and developed high fever and desaturation.
A new massive interstitial infiltrate was observed on X-ray, with no analytical elevation of acute phase reactants.
A differential diagnosis is made between inflammatory immune reconstitution syndrome and recurrence of pneumonia by cystis, and lung involvement by CMV, and other etiologies.
Bronchoscopy was performed with negative study for tuberculosis.
In BAS, positive immunofluorescence for cystis and CMV PCR were detected: 4860UI/ml.
Ganvir iv continued and a new 21-day cycle of cotrimoxazole IV and corticotherapy was performed, with resolution of the condition and hospital discharge.
Follow-up in consultations with progressive improvement of their immunovirological status with ̄.
At month +7: CD4 126 (7.9%), undetectable viral load.
Eleven months after the initial admission, the patient presented dysthermic sensation and pleuritic pain of three days onset, significant left pleural effusion.
Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated.
PPD ninth: 36mm.
A CT scan of the effusion was performed, including those requiring▁bronchoscopy, in which a thorough study of TB was negative.
Pleural biopsy was finally performed by videothoracoscopy, with negative cultures but with caseifying granulons in the pathology suggestive of tuberculous pleuritis and positive PCR in this sample.
The patient was treated with RHPZx2+RHx4 months, with resolution.
