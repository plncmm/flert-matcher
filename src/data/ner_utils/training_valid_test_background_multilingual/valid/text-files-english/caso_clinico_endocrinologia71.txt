A 53-year-old male patient presented with self-palpation of the left breast mass.
The patient begins cross-hormonal treatment with intramuscular testosterone at increasing doses at 36 years of age.
Two years later, bilateral mastectomy with nipple reimplantation was performed, followed by hysterectomy with double adnexectomy along with sex resignation surgery. She had no history of interest except for a maternal aunt with breast cancer.
Physical examination revealed a firm mass of less than 2 cm, which was not painful.
Mammography and spiculated nodule of 18 mm with polymorphic calcifications in the upper quadrant of the left breast were performed, confirming the diagnosis of malignancy.
Breast ultrasound: Spiculated contour nodule with polymorphic calcifications in SCU of MI; 18 mm diameter.
Mammography: Bilateral fibroglandular tissue.
Post-treatment changes in both breasts.
Spiculated contour nodule with polymorphous calcifications in SCU of MI;18 mm diameter.
To complete the study, a chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were performed, which were compatible with normality.
Left tumerectomy and biopsy of the centineal ganglion were performed. Histopathological examination of the estrogen receptor showed a non-endocrine carcinoma of the human‚ñÅepidermal receptor (PR) 50% and real receptor (PR1) 100% gamma.
After presenting the case in an oncology committee, it was decided to complete treatment with chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant therapy, and it was recommended that the patient discontinue testosterone therapy.
Currently, the patient is being treated with tamoxifen after 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel.
During the treatment, the patient decided not to discontinue testosterone treatment due to fear of disappearance of secondary male characters despite the presence of androgen receptors in the tumor.
