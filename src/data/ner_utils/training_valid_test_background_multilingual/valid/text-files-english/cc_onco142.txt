Anamnesis A 71-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department in February 2014 with progressive dyspnea on rest, together with cough without expectoration.
She had no other symptoms.
The patient had a history of well-controlled hypertension and subclinical hypothyroidism.
In April 2007, after being diagnosed incidentally of a left renal mass in an abdominal ultrasound, a left radical nephrectomy was performed, whose anatomopathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma G2-3 Fuhrman capsule respected renal vein (Fuhrman capsule).
The patient continues to be followed until December 2008 after a disease-free interval of 20 months, there was a recurrence in the mediastinal and subcarinal▁ganglia, which was confirmed after puncture of an adenopathy guided by echoendoscopic findings.
As this is a patient with a good prognosis according to the MSKCC criteria, treatment was initiated in January 2009 with sunitinib 50 mg daily according to scheme 4/2, with a total of 33 cycles of partial adenopathy.
From cycle 13, the patient needs a reduction of one dose level for grade III neutropenia.
In June 2013, after a progression-free interval of 54 months, the patient was admitted for unstable condition, identifying a single brain lesion in the occipital region of▁2.9 cm surgery, which is▁resected with free margins, compatible with renal origin.
A new treatment line is started with a 10 mg/day regimen with the Signs and Symptoms Symptoms.
Three months later, the patient required urgent assessment for partial respiratory failure.
A steroid treatment was started, a high resolution CT was performed, which was compatible with pneumonitis and imaging. Microbiological cultures were requested, which were negative.
After clinical improvement, the patient reintroduces a new bladder at a dose of 5 mg/24 h, a treatment maintained until admission in February 2014 with suspicion of interstitial pneumonitis grade III.
Radiologically, the patient presents stability of the tumoral disease, but with persistence of an extensive interstitial alveolar infiltrate.
Physical examination revealed tachypnea of 20▁rpm and basal oxygen saturation 85%, and nasal spectacles at 4 bpm 92%.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed basal dry crackles.
Rest of the anodyne exploration.
▁Complementary tests » Analytically stands out anemia with a hemoglobin level of 1 g/dl, not leukocytosis left.
» Chest X-ray: bilateral interstitial alveolar infiltrate.
» Thoracic CT angiography: no signs of acute pulmonary thromboembolism.
Mediastinal adenopathies.
There was extensive interstitial lung involvement, slightly increased compared to the previous study.
» the CT findings as well as the torpid clinical evolution of the patient, it is decided to perform a fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy to rule out other associated infectious or inflammatory processes and confirm the pneumonitis.
It is performed the same, which macroscopically identifies chronic inflammatory signs, and the samples obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage are sent for microbiology and transbronchial biopsy for pathological anatomy.
» Microbiology.
Sputum culture: habitual bacterial flora, negative culture and negative culture of non-heart-negative, Zhiel-auramine: antigen, Aspergillus: negative, C. pneumoniae: negative, CMV PCR and respiratory virus:culuria,
» Pathological anatomy: malignant epithelial cell emboli are observed in capillary vessels under the bronchial mucosa.
The cells have a wide clear cytoplasm and prominent central nucleus.
Immunohistochemical study was performed with positivity for CD10 and negativity TTF1, so the result is compatible with carcinomatous lymphangitis of renal origin.
Diagnosis After ruling out an infectious origin, and with the histological confirmation that the bilateral pulmonary alveolar infiltrate presented by the patient was not related to the oncological treatment, but rather due to a regular clinical steroid treatment explained the regular antibiotic progression,
Treatment The patient evolved favorably, although dyspnea persisted with moderate efforts, although she was discharged home with corticoid therapy and chemotherapy.
Given the progression of the disease demonstrated by transbronchial biopsy, a third line of treatment with sorafenib 400 mg every 12 hours was initiated in April 2014.
Since then, the patient has shown significant clinical improvement, with permanent discontinuation of steroid treatment and home therapy.
In the studies, the patient presents improvement of carcinomatous lymphangitis, fulfilling stability criteria of the oncological disease.
