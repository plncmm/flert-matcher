A 65-year-old Malaysian man came to the emergency department with acute lethargy during the last week, which initially attributed to Ramadan fasting.
During the last two days, she had nausea and vomited small amounts of non-bilious and non-hemorrhagic gastric contents twice a day during fasting, but did not report diarrhea or abdominal pain.
She reported no fever or respiratory symptoms.
Your family doctor found leucocyte in your blood tests and sent it to the emergency department.
Before the onset of symptoms, the patient was in good health and worked full time.
Its only medication was allopurinol 100 mg daily orally to prevent gout.
However, she had no relevant medical or family history.
He didn't take supplements, he was abstemio and had never smoked.
On physical examination, she was afflicted and hemodynamically stable, without the need for oxygen, but her oral mucosa was dry.
Neurological, respiratory and abdominal examination were normal and the patient was clinically euthyroid.
Analytical tests revealed severe hyponatremia (sodium concentration mmol/L), increased markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, 2 mg/L) and leukocyte (total leukocyte count, 115x10).
Serum creatinine, urea, potassium and bicarbonate concentrations were anodyne, and the patient was not anemic or thrombocytopenic.
The high value of C-reactive protein and leucocyte tended to search for the source of some infection and, consequently, a chest X-ray revealed patchy alveolar opacities in the right, middle and community-acquired pneumonia.
Due to the COPCRID-19 sprout in Singapore, it was isolated in the pulmonology plant and nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for a SARS-CoV-2 test by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
However, PCR for atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Bordetella was negative.
As the patient had no cough, we could not collect sputum for testing.
Additional tests were performed to determine the cause of severe hyponatremia.
A thyroid functional test revealed a low concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone, with 0.221 mIU/L, normal free T4 value, with 12.86 pmol/L and an undetectable T3 value (< 2.0 mcg/dL).
A rapid tetracosactrin test (Synacthen) performed at 08:00 showed an adequate adrenal response (299 nmol/L at 0 min; 630 nmol/L at 30 min; 834 nmol/L).
Blood and urine analyses did not indicate inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIHAD, serum osmolarity 256 mOsm/kg; urine osmolarity < 20 mOsuriam/kg).
The patient was seen by an endocrinologist who diagnosed severe hypovolemic hyponatremia and euthyroid patient syndrome.
Upon diagnosis of mild pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the patient was admitted to the isolation plant of COVID-19.
The patient received a provisional oral amoxicillin (875 mg) treatment with clavulanate (125 mg, Augmentine) twice daily and amoxicillin (100 mg) twice daily for seven days.
To treat severe hypovolemic hyponatremia, the patient was hydrated with an isotonic saline infusion IV.
and serum sodium concentration increased from 115 to 127 mmol/L in one day and then to 132 mmol/L in four days.
Subsequently, lethargy, vomiting and nausea disappeared.
As the patient continued to suffer from distress and remained hemodynamically stable without the need for oxygen, she was not treated with antiviral drugs.
On the eighth day after admission, the patient was discharged and transferred to a quarantine center.
