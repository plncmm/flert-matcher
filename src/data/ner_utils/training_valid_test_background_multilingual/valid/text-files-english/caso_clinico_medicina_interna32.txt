A 33-year-old male patient with no relevant medical and surgical history was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with fever of up to 39oC and headache of approximately one week duration.
He had followed empirical outpatient treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid without improvement.
The temperature was 37.5oC and the physical examination revealed non-painful hepatomegaly.
No heart murmurs were heard.
Laboratory tests showed mild elevated pancytopenia [LOTH alteration b 11.8 mg/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, MCV 9 la coagulation disorder 202 IU/M 30.3 g/dL, 4110 leukocytes/mm3 (77% MPAG2,
The patient was admitted to our service for study.
Urine analysis, chest X-ray and CSF biochemistry were normal.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a notable hepatomegaly, an image of probable abscess versus necrotic area in the lower splenic pole of approximately 41x26 mm and a high retroperitoneal adenopathy.
The imaging study was completed with a toco-abdominal CT scan which showed an athletic-atelectasis of the left lower lobe of the liver and normal condensation of the same parenchyma suggestive of splenic ischemic lesion.
A transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out endocarditis.
Both hemocultives and coprocultives and detection of bacterial antigens and adenovirus and rotavirus in‚ñÅfaeces were negative.
Serology was negative for E. burnstein, cytooxymegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis A, B and C virus, Leishmania, Brucella, Entamoeba histophyerophyas).
However, we obtained weakly positive results in IgM of Parvovirus B19 with negative IgG, four times more IgM values in a control analytical performed one week later.
A thrombophilia study was carried out in which the positivity for lupus anticoagulant, protein S activity of 40% and anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibody values above 150 (laboratory detection limitis) were highlighted.
The rest of the autoimmune study was negative.
The subsequent evolution of the complete blood count, as well as the decrease in CRP and transaminases was discharged after 20 days of admission, asymptomatic, internal aphthous ulcers and outpatient consultations with infectious disease showed progressive normalization of symptoms.
