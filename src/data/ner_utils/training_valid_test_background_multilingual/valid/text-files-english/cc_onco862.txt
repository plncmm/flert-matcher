Anamnesis A 45-year-old male, with no personal or family history of interest, born in Dominican Republic, diagnosed in August 2016 in his country of origin, with rectal adenocarcinoma, locally advanced constipation, from rectal pain.
She came to our center where a pelvic MRI was performed in September 2016, showing a 9 cm mucinous tumor that affects the superior and middle rectum, 6 cm from the anal margin with extensive inguinal invasion.
In the CT extension study, retroperitoneal lymph node involvement was evident, corresponding therefore to stage IV (cT3dN2M1).
After presenting the case in the multidisciplinary committee of digestive tumors, and due to the poor symptomatic control (pain, refractory pain, obstruction and rectal bleeding), an▁incipient treatment with QT-RT is proposed, with initial discharge intent.
During surgery, a biopsy of an implant in mesosigma was performed, with histological result compatible with carcinoma with cells with cytoplasmatic vacuum-assisted in signet ring, with normal▁immunohistochemical staining of mutated BR2 phenotype consistent with intestinal origin.
Ascitic fluid was positive for malignant epithelial cells.
Pelvic radiation therapy began in October 2016 with concurrent intention (10x300 cGy) and capecitabine 825 mg/m2/c12 h.
As complications he presented exanthematous systemic infection by parvovirus B19 with associated coagulopathy that required admission.
A CT scan showed a clear tumor progression with pleural effusion, peritoneal dissemination with mild ascites and increased retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
In November 2016, a first-line treatment with FOLFOX-6 + cetuximab 500 mg/m2/c14 d regimen was initiated with a baseline CEA of 627ng/ml.
After the fourth cycle, in January 2017, radiological stability of the disease was observed, with doubtful new bone lesions, but with biochemical response (CEA 92ng/ml).
In February 2017, a bone scintigraphy was performed, which showed a diffuse increase in uptake throughout the skeleton.
However, when reviewing the images of previous CT scans, these lesions were already present, and currently they also associated response data.
It was therefore decided to continue with the same chemotherapy scheme▁combining zoledronic acid from the 6th cycle.
In March 2017 she completed 8 cycles, presenting as the most striking toxicities acneiform rash grade 2, and neutropenia grade 2.
At the reevaluation CT, most of the lesions were stable, with exclusively bone progression, and with a slight increase in ascites, but lower peritoneal uptake.
Tumor markers continued to decrease (ECA 52.3 ng/ml).
After the last cycle or infectious fever with worsening of acneiform rash, the patient came to the hospital complaining of several cutaneous nodules, which had been progressively established during the last two weeks, without pain or pruritic pain.
Due to suspicion of secondary involvement, the patient was referred to the Department of Rheumatology for evaluation and skin biopsy.
Location: Nodules without▁epidermal component in number 10-15, 1-3 cm in diameter, overlying, without phlogistic component, hard not adhered to deep subcutaneous layers.
They are not painful to move or pressure.
No fistulization.
No digital pressure.
Absence of peeling.
Distribution in facial, thoracic, dorsal, abdominal and upper limbs.
▁Complementary tests Nodules without▁epidermal component in number 10-15, 1-3 in diameter, raised, without phlogistic component, hard adhered to subcutaneous planes and not deep subcutaneous adhesion to the wound.
They are not painful to move or pressure.
No fistulization.
No digital pressure.
Absence of peeling.
Distribution in facial, thoracic, dorsal, abdominal and upper limbs.
On March 2017 CT, the pleural effusion was stable, with nonspecific punctiform pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes unchanged.
Ascitic fluid with slight increase.
Multiple progressive bone lesions compared to previous CT.
The anatomopathological results of the skin biopsy confirmed the occupation of the reticular dermis by multiple nests with glandular morphology or loose cells with signet ring cell morphology.
They were diffusely distributed in the dermis or dissecting collagen bundles.
The cells were pleomorphic with clear and wide cytoplasm.
Immunohistochemical techniques revealed cytokeratin AE1-AE3, cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.
Diagnosis Cutaneous metastases from adenocarcinoma of intestinal origin with signet ring cells.
Treatment of tumour progression at the cutaneous level, the initiation of a second-line treatment is proposed, according to the scheme FOLFIRI + betaizumab.
Previously to the beginning of the second line, Ev presented a rapid clinical deterioration with an increase in skin lesions, being admitted in April 2017 for a condition of intestinal subocclusion.
A new CT scan showed a clear progression of the pleural effusion and peritoneal and adenopathic involvement.
Because of the risk of perforation, treatment with FOLFIRI without antiangiogenic drugs was initiated, with no response, worsening of the pleural effusion and associated respiratory failure.
The patient died on April 29, 17, 8 months after the initial diagnosis.
