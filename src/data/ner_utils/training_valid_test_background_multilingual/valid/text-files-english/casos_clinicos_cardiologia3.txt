ANATECE OF AREAS, AREAS FOURTH DISEASE AND EXPLORTS The present case is focused on a 72-year-old male admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) from November 2016 to
The personal history of this patient is: Independent for basic activities of daily living (BADL).
Smoker.
Hypercholesterolaemia (HTA), dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, treated with oral antidiabetics (OAD).
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3A.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Bladder neoplasia in 2011 treated with surgery (cystoprostatectomy + Bricker ileostomy) and subsequently CT.
Cardiac history: stable chronic ischemic heart disease (AMI) in 1999 and followed up by a primary care physician.
As previously noted, the patient was admitted to a psychiatric ward.
To stop the arrhythmic problem at the acute time, the patient required five cardioversions and continuous intravenous infusion of procainamide.
Due to the persistence of ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) similar in morphology to the one described above, it was overestimated by means of femoral electrocatheter, solving the arrhythmogenic activity.
During admission, coronary angiography showed diffuse ischemic heart disease, with 3-vessel disease, without acute lesions, and cardiac surgery was discouraged due to the high surgical risk of the patient.
The patient was referred for electrophysiological study (EFS) and ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) which, as a complication, presented complete atrial-ventricular block (e. g. phenobarbital, n = 12) with implantable
The patient remains asymptomatic for angina and ventricular arrhythmias for 8 months, until July 2017 when he is admitted to internal medicine due to febrile syndrome under study.
ANALYTICAL COMPLEMENTARY PRUEBAS at admission (23 July 2017): creatinine 1.95 mg/dl (33.9 ml/mi/1.73 m2), urea 52 mg/dl, potassium 137 mEq/dl
METHODS: 23/07: positive for Staphylococcus aureus oxacilin sensitive.
06/08: negative.
09/08: negative.
Staphylococcus epidermis (contamination is considered) grows in a bottle.
14/08: negative.
16/08: negative.
21/08: negative.
24/08: negative.
28/08: negative.
TORAX RADIOGRAPHY: slightly rotated plaque with cardiothoracic index (CTI) within normal limits, mild signs of vascular malformation.
Electrodes of the right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV) were normal and had no signs of fracture.
PET-CT: Focal collection at the level of the left笆《ubclavian vein located in the left笆《ubclavian vein due to the infectious process cause of bacteremia and probable lower outflow fever corresponds to the mildest and worst-sided uptake of the same etiology.
Mild bilateral pleural effusion.
Changes after radical prostatectomy with Bricker shunt.
There were no other hypermetabolic locations in the rest of the study.
TEE: non-dilated left ventricle (LV), with severe depression of myocardial function and akinesia of all segments of the anterior and lateral face.
RV with ICD cable, in which at the level of the tricuspid valve a sessile, beating image was observed, compatible with a 3 x 5 mm device cable-dependent vegetation.
笆，LINICAL EVOLUTION The patient remains asymptomatic for 8 months, until July 2017 when he enters internal medicine for febrile syndrome to study.
Staphylococcus aureus grows in hemocultives (2 x 2 serials).
A transesophageal echocardiogram was requested, which showed vegetation on the device.
PET-CT was requested to constant infection of the ICD cable.
Initially, the antibiotic was switched to cloxacillin with the result of the antibiogram.
After confirming ICD catheter infection, daptomycin adjusted for glomerular filtration and rifampicin is reintroduced.
Gentamicin was not added due to deterioration of renal function.
Energy was fixed to cardiac surgery at the referral center for explanting the device, performing extraction with sources of energy.
Subsequently, the patient was readmitted to the CCU with an escape rhythm at 36-38 bpm with good tolerance.
Antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin was continued during admission.
The patient has episodes of NSVT and, despite bradycardia, amiodarone is reintroduced.
The patient笆》olerates sitting and walking without low cardiac output clinic.
After negative culture and control echocardiogram with no evidence of vegetation, it was decided to implant a new device.
The possibility of epicardial approach is discussed, but finally transvenous ICD-DDD implantation is performed.
After discharge, the patient has followed controls by the infectious disease service of our center, clinically stable until now.
DIAGNOSIS Endocrinitis caused by Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus on the native tricuspid valve associated with the device.
Complete post-ablation AV block.
Antecedents of fantasy to harm caused ICD implantation.
Chronic ischemic heart disease.
Mild ventricular dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension severe COPD.
Chronic kidney disease stage 3A.
Functional monorene.
Bricker cystoprostatectomy and cystoileostomy for bladder neoplasia in 2011 and adenocarcinoma prosecutive.
Hypertrichosis
Diabetes mellitus.
Dyslipidemia
