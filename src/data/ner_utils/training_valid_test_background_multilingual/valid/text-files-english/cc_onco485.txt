Anamnesis A 55-year-old male with a personal history of interest in active smoking (pack-year index: 52), multinodular goiter and proximal radius fracture.
As a family history of cancer, her mother died of breast cancer at age 67 and a maternal uncle of leukemia at age 50.
Do not take any treatment on a regular basis.
The patient began in early 2016 with an increase in cough with bilateral costal pain of pleuritic characteristics, associated with dyspnea on moderate exertion.
Asthenia and weight loss about 12 kg
She came to the emergency department with a chest X-ray showing a large mass in the LSD, and therefore began studying internal medicine.
Physical status The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (EC) of 1.
Good general condition, eupneic.
No relevant findings during physical examination.
▁Complementary tests Chest and abdominal computed tomography: large mass (75 x 70 mm) located in the apical segment of the LSD, with a wide central necrotic component.
The tumor is in wide contact with mediastinal.
Multiple lymphadenopathies of significant size in the right hilium and▁mediastinum: right paratracheal region (short axis 35 mm adenopatic▁conglomerate), right subcarinal region, paraesophageal window.
Endoscopic ultrasound showed subcarinal and paratracheal lymph nodes.
Samples for pathological anatomy were taken, obtaining in the right paratracheal adenopathy material corresponding to metastasis poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, negative EGFR and non-translocated ALK.
PET-CT: LSD mass measuring approximately 8.2 x 7.7 x 8.0cm (AP, L, CC) with SUVmax 26.8.
High and low-sized right paratracheal mediastinal adenopathies and pathological uptake.
▁Right hiliar caption SUVmax 4.9 under malignancy.
Diagnosis Adenocarcinoma of LSD cT4 pN2 cM0, stage IIIB, non-mutated EGFR, non-translocated ALK.
Treatment On April 2, 2016 chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intention was initiated according to the cisplatin regimen (day 1): vinorelbine (days 1 and 8).
Ev. Transferred the second cycle of treatment, requires change to a plateau-vinorelbina due to poor tolerance, but still presents deterioration of the general state.
It was decided to suspend neoadjuvant treatment and it was presented in the Committee of Tumors. Surgical treatment (due to functional deterioration) was ruled out and radical treatment with radiotherapy was completed.
A reassessment PET scan prior to the initiation of radiotherapy revealed progression of the lung mass.
Radiation therapy was performed between August 23, 2016 and October 14, 2016 with irradiation of the tumor mass LSD and lymph node areas affected, reaching a total dose of 66 Gy.
A partial response was observed on December 2016 re-evaluation CT, which showed a new bilateral and mediastinal pulmonary progression in April 2017.
Treatment with immunotherapy (anti-PD-1) was started, with the first cycle on June 27, 2015.
On July 6/2017 patients were admitted to hospital due to diarrhoea G3 (8 out of every day) with negative microbiological isolates.
It begins in the first instance antibiotic therapy, without clinical improvement, so corticoid therapy is initiated when it is suspected that toxicity secondary to immunotherapy with progressive clinical improvement.
One week later, the patient was discharged with a descending pattern of corticosteroids.
Treatment was restarted, establishing a second cycle on August 31, 2015.
Clostridium difficile is admitted again due to diarrhea on the 15/9/2017. Initially, in the presence of possible colitis related to immunotherapy, intravenous corticotherapy and absolute diet are initiated. Diagnostic tests are also requested to rule out concomitant processes with anti-microbial diphtheria.
The patient has a good initial evolution, and oral tolerance can be restarted and corticoid therapy can be discontinued. However, in a second time the patient presents exacerbation of the condition, so an infectious role of drug toxicity added to the treatment is not completely ruled out.
Corticosteroid therapy was reintroduced and antibiotic treatment was modified with subsequent progressive improvement.
The patient was discharged but continued with grade 2 diarrhea, so he required a longer corticosteroid therapy, with a decline in cycle 3, on October 24, 2016.
From the oncological point of view, a reassessment is carried out with the objective of verifying the response of the disease and ground glass opacities of bilateral inflammatory aspect of right predominance that suggest pneumonitis.
These images showed no clinical correlation, and the patient was asymptomatic from the respiratory point of view.
Treatment was suspended due to digestive toxicity, presenting several exacerbations with decreased doses of corticoids.
In January 2018, in the context of a decrease in corticoid doses, CT showed a slight increase in the consolidation images in LSD of an indeterminate nature, and the possibility of progression cannot be ruled out.
Bronchoscopy was performed and the examination was normal. The pathological anatomy of bronchial biopsies revealed nonspecific chronic fibrosing and inflammatory changes, with no signs of malignancy.
A new prolonged descending pattern was performed until June 2018, when replacement with hydroalteone was performed.
She remains untreated, with close follow-up every 2 months, maintaining response, with no evidence of measurable disease last CT May 2019.
