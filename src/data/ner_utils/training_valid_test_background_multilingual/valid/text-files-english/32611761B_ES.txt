A 49-year-old man, otherwise healthy, with fever, myalgia and dry cough of 1 week duration.
Few hours after admission, the patient presented difficulties in establishing objects, spatiotemporal disorientation, confusion and restlessness.
A chest CT scan showed bilateral peripheral opacities suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Cranial CT and MRI obtained two days later were irrelevant.
CSF showed‚ñÅlymphocytic pleocytosis and proteinorrhachia.
Empirical treatment was initiated with a virologic agent, ampicillin and ceftriaxone, which became interchangeable as cultures and PCR of CSF yielded negative results.
PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in nasopharyngeal swabs but negative in CSF.
Three days later, the patient had recovered normal, except for amnesia of the previous days.
