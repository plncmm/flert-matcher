A 46-year-old woman with a history of migraine presented to the emergency department with right glue pain, fever and general▁malaise, with no apparent infectious focus.
Location of the right upper limb that had previously been treated for headache with two intramuscular injections (dexketoprofen im + metamizole im) administered for two consecutive days in the primary care centre
In the emergency department, the patient presented TA 106/69 mm Hg; Fc 109 bpm; T 38oC; conscious and oriented; Sat O2 94%, with no other findings on physical examination.
Antipyretics are prescribed.
The patient continued to have fever, coughing, although without focality.
A cranial CAT scan was requested, which was normal, and a lumbar puncture was also performed.
Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and dexamethasone was initiated when CNS infection was suspected, which after complementary tests was ruled out.
Subsequently, the patient presented TA 50/26 mmHg, and treatment with vasoactive drugs was initiated, increasing antibiotic coverage.
Physical re-exploration, during his stay under observation, highlights a nodulated and hot zone in the right glue supero-externe quadrant, painful to ̄s appearance.
A CT scan of soft tissues was performed to rule out abscess, where an undefined increase in density was observed at the level of fat in the right glue region with contact and increased size of the greater glue muscle compatible with extensive phlegm.
After 24 hours, the patient developed respiratory distress with bilateral infiltrate on chest X-ray and hemodynamic deterioration.
Due to the poor evolution of the disease, the decision was made to perform surgery despite the absence of visualisation in abdominal CAT scans.
The right glottis area was debrided and necrotic areas were removed for culture (increasing community MRSA) and for PA: necrotizing fasciitis.
Since admission to the ICU, she continued treatment with daptomycin plus clindamycin, and immunoglobulins were added to treat toxic shock that were suspended for thrombopenia despite daily transfusions.
Anasarca.
First phase, a characterization by IRA.
Twelve hours later, the patient started ARDS with good response to mechanical ventilation.
After extubation, the patient presents desaturations that do not allow oxygen to be withdrawn within a few days and starts spontaneous polyuria.
The final diagnosis was toxic shock secondary to necrotizing fasciitis caused by community MRSA in a nasal carrier of Staphylococcus aureus with multiple organ failure.
