Personal history A 25-year-old male, Swedish student and resident in Spain for two months, with no relevant pathological history.
Current illness in the Emergency Department due to fever of 39oC with arthralgias and its prof. de ̄ 48 hours evolution.
Eighteen days before he had returned from Morocco after a stay at the Atlas Mountain, referring to an episode of self-limiting diarrhea during his journey.
One week after his return, he developed diarrhoea, without pathological products, and fever for five days, yielding the clinic after ciprofloxacin treatment.
Physical examination: conscious and oriented, with acceptable general condition, normal color and well perfused, with a temperature of 39oC.
The patient had blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, and arterial oxygen saturation of 99% (FiO2 0.21).
There were no lymphadenopathies related to consolidation, neck▁rigidity or meningeal signs.
Upon cardiac auscultation, the patient was rhythmic, tachycardic, with a systolic murmur pan-type I/VI.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed preserved vesicular murmur in both hemithorax without other sounds.
As for the abdomen, hepatomegaly was observed in about 2 cases, being depressible, non-painful and presenting normal air-fluid sounds.
No signs of peritoneal irritation were observed.
Lower limbs showed no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis, with full and symmetrical pulses.
▁Complementary laboratory tests showed hemoglobin levels of 11 g/dL, MCV 85, 1520 leukocytes/μL and 38,000 platelets.
The results of blood biochemistry highlighted were total bilirubin 3.11 mg/dL to the presence of indirect fraction, AST 43 IU/L, LDH 713 IU/L and CRP 9 mg/dL as abnormal data
The determination of normal antinuclear antibodies.
Chest X-ray and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly.
Blood cultures and serologies for Salmonella, Brucella, Rixosia and Coxiella, Borrelia, Leishmania, Parvovirus B19,▁Cytomegalovirus, herpes simpleplasma virus were negative.
Diagnostic test: thick silver and peripheral blood extension: Giemsa staining where intraerythrocytic forms of infection by Plasmodium vivax were observed.
Clinical judgement Paludism for P. vivax.
The antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed with absence of malaria cases recently described in Morocco where she had travelled was prescribed. The patient was referred to a trip prior to Indonesia two years earlier with correct compliance with chloroquine.
Treatment was initiated with quinine (10 mg/kg) and fever (100 mg/day, 12 hours later) for seven days, followed by radical cure with primaquine (0.25 mg/kg blood count for 14 days) after ruling out glucose-6 deficiency.
Two weeks later, the patient consulted due to fever and sweating, which was interpreted as a recrudescence of the infection due to probable tolerance to primaquine (described in Indonesia).
Treatment with quinine and primaquine was started again, this time at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (30 mg/day) for 14 days, with complete resolution.
