A 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension treated and treated with a hypersensitivity reaction at 25 years of age presented with epigastric pain, melena and asthenia for 15 days.
He did not report dysphagia, heartburn or altered bowel habits.
Physical examination was normal, but no evidence of hyponutrition was found. No masses or visceromegaly were found in the abdomen.
Laboratory tests revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia with Hgb of 10 gr/dl and Hto of 33%.
Chest and abdominal X-rays showed no changes of interest.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a normal esophagus, a gastric cavity without remnants hebacter cyst not as a normal mucosa and erosions on an edematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. A gastritis was detected taking biopsies in the antrum.
Abdominal ultrasound showed the liver, gallbladder and pancreas to be normal.
With the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to erosive duodenitis and anemia secondary to digestive loss, the patient was discharged for outpatient treatment with antisecretory drugs.
The patient was readmitted three weeks later due to a new episode of melena. A new upper endoscopy was performed, looking at an esophagus, gastric cavity and bulb, with the rest of the duodenum, appreciable ulceration of the tumor and not isolated at the duodenal mucosa.
A short intestinal transit procedure was performed, which showed a proximal stricture that allowed passage of contrast.
An abdominal CAT scan showed the presence of a mass in proximal extension and alterations without finding regional or retroperitoneal lymph nodes of significant size. No focal lesions were observed.
With the diagnosis of low-grade leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine and after ruling out distant tumor extension or local invasion in imaging studies, surgical treatment was decided with tumor resection and subsequent duodenojejunal anastomosis.
The evolution of the patient was satisfactory without requiring adjuvant treatment.
