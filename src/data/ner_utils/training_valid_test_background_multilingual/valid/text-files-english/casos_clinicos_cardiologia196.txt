A 42-year-old male from China with no relevant past medical history came to the emergency room for a syncope episode along with general▁malaise and dysthermia.
She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of possible respiratory septic shock with necrotizing bilateral pneumonia.
Imaging tests showed abscesses in the lung, kidney and liver, as well as a thrombus in the inferior vena cava and cavo-auricular junction.
An echocardiogram showed a large multilobulated mass with apparent origin in the Eustachian valve.
Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in the first blood cultures and bronchial aspirate.
Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermis resistant to mucus was isolated in subsequent hemocultives.
Subsequently, no new microorganisms were isolated and the rest of the cultures were sterile.
The main diagnostic possibilities were myxoma, vegetation and thrombus.
Despite antibiotic and anticoagulant treatment, new abscesses and lung lesions continued to appear and echocardiography showed no changes in the mass, so, in the presence of suspicion of vegetation with/without associated thrombus, surgical resection was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass.
To perform the intervention with the greatest possible safety for venous drainage, percutaneous cannulation of the femoral vein (progressing the cannula into the inferior vena cava) and cannulation of the superior vena cava were chosen.
A right longitudinal atriotomy and temporary release of the inferior vena cava tourniquet were performed for resection of the implant base.
The▁resected mass showed an insertion of the Eustachian valve and was approximately 35 × 10 mm in size.
Since the Eustachian valve was a large prominent structure, resection was performed.
No new abscesses or lung lesions appeared after surgery.
The microbiological study was sterile, and the histopathological study of the mass was compatible with fibrin sealant material, so anticoagulant treatment was maintained.
At the end of the cycle of intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient was discharged without sequelae and undergoing rehabilitation.
At 4 months of follow-up, the patient was in functional class i. No new intracardiac masses were found in the control echocardiogram. Imaging tests showed resolution of pulmonary lesions without the appearance of new abscesses.
