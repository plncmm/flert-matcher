Anamnesis We report the case of a 61-year-old man with no known personal history of interest, ex-smoker with an accumulated pack-year index of 30, without other toxic habits.
She has no family history of interest.
She was seen in the emergency room in March 2018 due to general▁malaise and progressive asthenia of 4 months of evolution, without having come for this reason previously, and on her arrival she was unable to walk along with marked dyspnea at rest.
He also complained of weight loss and coughing.
Physical examination revealed a neglected physical appearance and mucocutaneous lesions, with oral cutaneous manifestations of glandular vesicles, which were raised in several areas of the body (neck, mucous back and mucosa fundamentally).
The vesicular lesions were located in the right hemifield but without neurological focus.
▁Complementary tests She was admitted to Internal Medicine to start the study, requesting a complete blood test with serology, highlighting in the results Western-Blot HIV-1 positive, HIV-1 viral load: 30 ml0.00
5.48),▁lymphopenia with CD4 5.02%, CD8 77.38%.
Hepatotropic virus and other negative serology except Entamoeba histolytica.
In the general analysis, moderate renal failure (creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and protein-calorie malnutrition (albumin 2.1 g/dl) stood out.
Diagnosis After testing, the patient was diagnosed with advanced HIV infection, stage C3 (AIDS).
Treatment by Infectious Internal Medicine, antiretroviral treatment with triple therapy was initiated as well as antibiotic prophylaxis for opportunistic diseases.
A chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion and effusion at admission. The study was completed with a complete right CT scan where numerous supra- and infradiaphragmatic pleural adenopathies were described.
Sequencing was performed, diagnostic and therapeutic, ruling out infectious involvement, with negative mycobacteria and with positive anatomopathological diagnosis for malignant tumor cells, with morphological and▁immunohistochemical findings consistent with positive primary herpes virus cavity
Biopsy was also performed on one of the cutaneous lesions and a laterocervical adenopathy, both with histological diagnosis compatible with Kaposi's sarcoma, associated with VHHH-8, which also showed esophageal and gastric mucosa evidenced by endoscopy.
The patient presented initial clinical and analytical improvement thanks to the antiretroviral treatment and support treatment during the first weeks. Due to the recovery, it was decided to admit the patient to the physician's office in order to assess the tumor treatment.
However, three weeks after starting treatment, clinical deterioration, fever and laboratory worsening again appeared, without microbiological findings suggestive of hemophilia or malignancy, which could explain this worsening, probably related to other syndromes.
Despite treatment, even with vasoactive drugs, the patient continued with sustained hypotension and progressive liver failure, which resulted in severe non-reversible hepatic encephalopathy, dying a few days later.
A clinical autopsy was requested, confined exclusively to the liver, with the final result of acute submassive cholestatic hepatitis with nonspecific centrilobular predominance, which may be due to both HIV and hepatotropic virus toxicity or filiation.
