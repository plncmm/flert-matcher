A 21-year-old woman came to our hospital with fever, cough, expectoration, diarrhea and dyspnea during coronavirus (COVID-19) in Daegu (South Korea).
Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19.
Troponin I value was 1.26 ng/mL (< 0.3 ng/mL) and N-terminal prohormone value of brain natriuretic peptide was 1929 pg/mL (< 125 pg/mL).
The chest X-ray revealed multifocal consolidation in both lung fields and cardiomegaly.
The electrocardiogram showed a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay and several premature ventricular complexes.
Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.
A chest CT scan revealed multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, in the lower lobe and with peripheral dominant distribution.
On cardiac CT, the coronary arteries were normal and the myocardium showed hypertrophy due to edema with perfusion anomaly combined in the lateral left ventricle.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high signal intensity (diffuse signal in the myocardium of LV assessed in the myocardial infarction quotient (myocardial infarction ratio regarding myocardial wall thickness), myocardial wall thickness (MIS = 2.2) and a
In the image sequence, the native T1 (mean size 1431 ms; lateral wall 1453 ms; âˆ¼1150 ms) reference value and extracellular volume (mean diffuse size 61%;25 diffuse reference value 29.7%; lateral wall).
An extensive transparietal late enhancement detection with gadolinium was performed.
Myasthenia gravis combined with COVID-19 was confirmed by multimodal imaging.
