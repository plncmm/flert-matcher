A 26-year-old male was admitted to Internal Medicine due to acute renal failure and impaired liver function tests.
She works in a workshop and has no medical or surgical history of interest.
He attends the gymnasium assiduously and recognizes the use of protein supplements and beta-blockers, which he suspended the week prior to admission.
She denied toxic consumption.
Four days prior to admission, the patient began with generalized myalgias and intermittent fever of up to 39oC, associating choleric urine and nausea.
On the day of admission she presented with diffuse abdominal pain, which is why she went to the emergency department.
It is hemodynamically stable, being the anodyne physical examination, highlighting only mild pain to generalized abdominal pain.
The first laboratory analysis showed significant elevation of transaminase levels (AST 4064 U/L, ALT 4064 U/L) and acute renal failure (urea 93 mg/dL, creatinine 4, 1905 mg/dL).
With these results and the clinic presented by the patient, a rapid test is requested for detection of the influenza virus, being positive for Influenza A virus, as well as CK and CKMB, with figures of 127,530 U/L and 1,680 respectively.
Renal replacement was performed without admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and monitoring, with good evolution with abundant hydration, urinary alkalinization and oseltamivir, with progressive improvement of renal function CKMB and hepatic decrease
Upon discharge, the patient is asymptomatic and with normal laboratory results.
Rhabdolysis associated with the Influenza A virus is poorly described in the literature.
This virus infects muscle cells, causing their destruction and consequently the elevation of muscle enzymes, causing acute tubular necrosis responsible for renal damage.
Exceptionally, as in our case, there may be hypertransaminasemia, and this elevation should not be confused with acute liver injury.
Although our patient did not require renal replacement therapy, sometimes it is necessary to apply it temporarily until the resolution of renal failure.
