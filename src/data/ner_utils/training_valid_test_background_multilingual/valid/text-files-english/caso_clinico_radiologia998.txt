An 80-year-old male with fever, cough, hemoptysis and weight loss.
This radiograph shows infiltrate in both upper lobes with cavities suggestive of active pulmonary TB.
In general, thin-spared cavities (<5mm) tend to be infectious and when the wall is thick (>10mm) squamous cell carcinoma enters the differential diagnosis.
TBC usually affects the upper lobes and the apical segment of the lower lobes.
However, within the upper lobe, involvement of the anterior segment is rare.
The diagnosis is confirmed by staining a sputum sample with Ziel Nielssen stain and culture in Lowenstein medium.
The cavitary disease of the upper lobe has a good correlation with a very positive sputum and for this reason highly cavitary.
Other differential dx of cavitary disease include infection by: Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, anaerobic bacteria and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, pulmonary infarction, Wegener's granulomatosis and rheumatoid nodules.
