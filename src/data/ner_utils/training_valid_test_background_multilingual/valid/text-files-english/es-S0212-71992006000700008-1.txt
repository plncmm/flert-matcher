A 62-year-old male, former smoker with no other relevant background, was admitted to the ICU of our center for seizure status.
According to his family, in the last weeks he was irritable and with child behavior, and also complained of heaviness and numbness in his right limbs in the last days.
Crises are controlled with i.v. phenytoin.
There were no remarkable findings in the emergency tests (analytical, ECG, brain CT), except for right basal atelectasis in the chest X-ray.
A lumbar puncture was performed, which showed acellular CSF but with hyperproteinorrhachia (72 mg/dl protein) and EEG with left temporal irritative activity.
A brain MRI study showed a hyperintense lesion on the left temporal lobe (FLAIR sequences and diffusion), which did not change after administration of paramagnetic contrast in hemorrhage, nor did it present foci of hemorrhage.
Treatment with phenytoin was prescribed, consisting of antiretroviral therapy (awaiting PCR for herpes simplex), and antibiotics (pneumonia) with Tazocel and Teicoplanin.
She did not present seizures again and remained afflicted with seizures.
On admission, there are no remarkable findings in the physical examination and neurological examination is conscious, with nominal dysphasia, ill-defined mood, attention deficit and tendency to fabular and mild right hemiparesis.
In the following days, paresis and language became normalized; however, there was persistence of muria and Korsakoff syndrome.
C-reactive protein (CRP) was completed on day 6 and antibiotherapy was negative for ESR.
Analytical studies were irrelevant except for mild elevation of CEA (3.9 ng/ml).
Anti-Hu antibodies, antithyroid drugs, serology (lues, HIV, neurotropic virus) were negative.
A screening of occult neoplasia was initiated, starting with TAC (mm. except for atelectasis/pneumonia LDI), urologic bone marrow examination with bronchoalveolar lavage (negative), upper endoscopy and intestinal biopsy, intestinal transit,
Given the normality of these studies, and with the diagnosis of PLE, a whole body anomaly was requested, which showed the presence of hypercaptation of fluoroglucose at the pharyngolaryngeal satellite level, as well as small adenoids.
The finding of neck TAC was confirmed, as well as the pathological study of the lesion that was diagnosed as epidermoid carcinoma of the pyriform sinus.
