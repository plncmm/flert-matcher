A 12-year-old boy, with no relevant history, consulted because five minutes after the evening washout on his back, presented generalized wheals and skin itching, chemosis and conjunctival itching.
He was treated in the Health Center (Avila) with intravenous methylprednisolone and dexchlorpheniramine, and the condition was resolved after five minutes.
He had previously received six common avispa splints without incidents.
Frequently, he contacts hives (absolute a situation) in Avila.
Results: Allergological study: determination of specific IgE (immunoCAP, Thermofisher) against complete extract and recombinant hymenoptera extract (KU/L)30 negative Ves dsp5: 12.
Skin tests were positive in intradermal reaction with 0.01 mcg/ml vespula spp. and negative with polistes (Pharmalgen® Hymenoptera venom ALK Abelló).
With the diagnosis of allergy to vespa velutina venom, specific immunotherapy treatment was initiated 100% vespula spp, in a 4-week group regimen.
According to the recommendations of the Hymenoptera Committee of the SEAIC, this is indicated due to the high cross-reactivity between Vespula, Dolichovespula and Vespa species.
