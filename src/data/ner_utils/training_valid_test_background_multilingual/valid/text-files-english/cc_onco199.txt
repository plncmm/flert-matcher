Anamnesis A 63-year-old male patient, former smoker for 14 years of 60 packs/year, hypertensive on treatment with hydrochlorothiazide/telmisartan once daily.
▁Oncological history: operated on in August 2012 for left renal neoplasia, she underwent radical nephrectomy without surgical complications.
Pathological anatomy (PA) reported a nodular lesion of 2.7 cm of well-defined diameter. Immunohistochemical study (IHC) showed strong positive expression for CK7 and CKhr papillary cell carcinoma 5.2, all of which was consistent with extensive multifocal necrosis
Clinical stage I (T1N0M0).
Because it is an indolent tumor, it was decided to follow six-monthly controls in charge of Urology, with no evidence of recurrence until December 2013 (abdominal CT).
The current disease begins in March 2014, when the patient comes to the emergency room for cough with limited hemoptoic expectoration of one week of evolution and constitutional syndrome of one month.
Establishment plan 1.
Good general condition, mucocutaneous, eupneic at rest.
Hemodynamically stable. Pulmonary auscultation was conserved, with no sounds overwhelmed; in the abdomen a scar of left lumbotomy was observed, extremities without edema.
Normal rectum.
▁Complementary tests The patient was admitted to the▁Pneumology Department to complete the study: » Analytical: hemoglobin 7.7 g/dl, leukocytes 6300 (lymphocytes 1,000), rest without alterations.
» Chest CT: a solid mass with lobulated contours of 70 x 70 mm in the posterior▁mediastinum, centered in the subcarinal region, which is introduced in the right bronchus; in addition, stenoses and obliterates the intermediate bronchus.
▁Right hiliar adenomegaly up to 14 mm.
» PET-CT: a 7 cm subcarinal bilobulated irregular hypermetabolic mass with right hiliar compatible with bronchial mass, which could not distinguish whether it was an adenopatic▁conglomerate or primary lesion.
» Two bronchofibroscopies are performed: cytologies are indicative of carcinoma, but biopsies are not diagnostic.
» The case is presented in the session of the Multidisciplinary Management Committee for Thoracic Tumors and it was decided to perform diagnostic mediastinoscopy, in view of the dilemma of being the mass a second primary tumor or metachronous metastasis.
Mediastinoscopy with biopsy of subcarinal adenopathy was performed.
PA reports: metastasis of carcinoma, IHC positive for vimentin, CD 10 and PAX 8, suggesting renal origin.
Diagnosis Mediastinal metastasis of primary renal carcinoma.
Treatment In June 2013, chemotherapy was initiated in a clinical trial, receiving pazopanib 800 mg/day, with monthly evaluations.
Eprimazole in August 2013 was hospitalized due to a non-condensing respiratory infection, with positive sputum cultures for Stenotropho-infection associated with clacivulaphilia, and amoxicillin-specific antibiotic treatment (amese
During admission, a CT (according to a clinical trial protocol) was performed, which described a decrease in the size of the infracarinal mediastinal mass, with the presence of bubbles inside the left iliac and common enlargement of the external iliac artery.
The persistence of respiratory symptoms and the patient mentions having to comply each time he eats food, with cough crisis later, a▁thorax radiography is performed, right basal condensation (not visualized previously).
Suspected esophageal fistula, an upper endoscopy is requested, which reports that a 5 cm long ulcerated compression is identified in the middle third of the esophagus. Therefore, an esophageal stent is placed in the same act.
After progressive improvement of symptoms, the patient was discharged.
Peaceopanib was restarted and received for another 2 months; however, despite the good radiological response, the patient presented a progressive deterioration of his general condition (November 4), and for this reason it was decided to suspend treatment.
Finally, the patient died in December 2014, 7 months after the diagnosis of recurrence.
