A 38-year-old male, heterosexual and immunocompetent, who came to our hospital six months after being diagnosed in another center of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion in his left eye (LE).
He would have received a triamcinolone transeptal with a significant improvement in his macular edema, which he received a short injection.
She had a visual acuity (VA) of 0.4 and cystic macular edema (QME) in the left eye.
The examination of the right eye was normal.
The study of thromboembolic risk factors and hypercoagulability performed was normal, except for the lupus anticoagulant, which was in limit values.
Intravitreal treatment was proposed with a tapered fixation and, after a loading dose (three monthly injections), no functional or anatomical improvement was obtained.
The patient abandoned treatment, but returned one year later due to worsening of vision.
The VA was 0.1 in the OI and greater thickening.
The rest of the examination was normal.
Given the previous failure of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), intravitreal dexamethasone implant was performed.
Six weeks after implantation, the patient presents a VA of 0.5 in the left eye and normalization of the thickening with normal ocular tensions.
Ten weeks after implantation, the patient came to the emergency department because of redness and pain in the left eye.
She reported nasal catarrh for a week.
The patient presented hand movement, an important inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber (cells and flare 3+), started pupillary synechiae, turbidity and whitish plaques in the peripheric area with low vision.
The examination of the RE was normal.
The patient was admitted to the hospital and an aqueous humor puncture was performed to analyze the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the herpes family and culture.
Serology was requested for herpes simplex, herpes zoster, Epstein-HIV, toxoplasmosis and loos.
A differential diagnosis of acute necrosis was established, which was maintained against endophthalmitis. Intravenous treatment with viral dermatitis began, which lasted seven days.
The aqueous humor sample was negative for herpes virus and negative culture (reported as contaminated by Streptococcus mitis).
Blood serology for you was positive (VDRL+ [Venereal Disease Research Laboratory], treponemic tests: IgG and IgM +).
The rest of the serologies were negative.
Lumbar puncture was performed: cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal and VDRL serology was negative.
The▁dermatological study found a lesion in the erythematous and glossy groin of three weeks of evolution: two primary chancro.
On the third day of admission, intravenous treatment with crystalline penicillin G was started, with a daily dose of 21 million intravenous units at a frequency of 3.5 million units every 4 hours for 14 days, although there was no progressive healing of the AV areas.
Multiple opacities and malformations were developed, and it was decided to approach via percutaneous coronary intervention.
Dexamethasone implant was visible in the lower periphery.
Performing open cholecystectomy took ten days due to the appearance of phlebitis in the left arm secondary to intravenous penicillin infusion.
During the resection, the superior retina of the face is seen as rigid.
The vitreous culture was negative.
Despite surgical closure with silicone injection, complete retinal reapplication was not achieved and the final VA was light perception.
The patient has been followed for one year and is stable.
