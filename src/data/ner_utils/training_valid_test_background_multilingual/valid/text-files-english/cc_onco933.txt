Peritonitis Pyometra is a rare condition defined as the presence of purulent material in the uterine cavity secondary to a difficulty in draining the uterus, which would lead to an increase in the volume of the purulent material leaving the uterus.
We report the case of a 58-year-old patient with no relevant medical history, independent for basic activities of daily living, who came to the emergency department on several occasions in March 2016 with symptoms of hypogastric pain and dysuria.
The patient was treated with antibiotics and urinary catheter for urinary retention on both occasions, on an outpatient basis.
When there was no improvement, the patient came to the emergency room a third time for the same clinic that reappeared upon removal of the bladder catheter.

EC
Malnourished, normohydrated, normocolored, conscious and oriented in time, space and person.
Eupneic.
« AC: rites, sem soplos.
» AP: conserved breath sounds, with no added sounds.
» Abdomen: painful during hypogastric tenderness, responsive to it.
No masses or enlargements.
» Lower limbs: no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Neurological: Glasgow 15/15.
Cholesterols and normoreactive.
Cranial preserved pairs.
There are no signs of neurological focality.
There is no nuchal▁rigidity.
Pathological assessment by endoscopy is also requested.
» Tactus bimanual: cervix effaced in forced anteversion, right free parametrium, left side seems thickened.
▁Complementary tests in the Emergency Room: » Basic blood count and biochemistry without alterations, except elevated reagents.
» Non-pathological urine sediment.
» Abdominal X-ray: apparent pelvic mass with normal rest of the study.
Abdominal ultrasound was requested.
» Abdominal ultrasound complements with nonpelvic vascularisation CT: free fluid in the abdominal cavity together with a heterogeneous mass that seems to correspond to uterine growth with thickening of the walls and cystic/necrotic center 12 mm thick/necrotic
It has a size of 100 x 100 x 90 and displaces adjacent structures, with bladder in anterolateral location.
They value as first option endometrial neoformative lesion given the patient's age and the presence of ascitic fluid, but other entities cannot be ruled out, and should complete the study with gynecological ultrasound and MRI.
» Gynecologic ultrasound: a 10 cm uterus with mixed ecorrefringence intrahepatic image, about 45 mm in endometrial thickness.
Homogeneous myometrium, atrophic adnexa, free fluid.
The patient is classified as having previously described malignancy findings. Pelvic MRI is requested: a 35 mm neoplasm located in the fundus, where there is a clear relationship between the sagittal plane endometrial tumor and the fundus.
The cervix looks normal.
It also presents a discontentment of the endometrial cavity due to the presence of fluid that could be called helium.
Probably carcinomatous ascites.
Uterine biopsy was performed by hysteroscopy, and the result of the pathological anatomy was an endocervical type epithelium with presence of CIN-3 type intraepithelial lesion, with intraglandular extension.
Intense and diffuse expression of p16 that suggests cervical origin, being therefore the diagnosis, cervical carcinoma.
The patient presents turtles during hospitalization, requiring a request for CT showing new loculated liquids and loculated intra-peritoneal puncture ultrasound with inflammatory/infectious infectious disease guided by abdominal pathology evaluation, guided by biophysical examination.
Abdominal fluid culture revealed the presence of Triporon jirovecii.
Diagnosis A uterine perforation secondary to pyometra is diagnosed, due to a cervical carcinoma minimum FIGO stage IIB, CT2B CN0 CMX, with peritonitis secondary to the evacuation of the abdominal cavity.
abdominal fluid collection and fluid collection compatible with infection, exploratory laparotomy was performed with drains and drainage, showing improvement of acute phase reactants in the following days, and treatment with empirical antibiotic therapy
Once the infectious process has been resolved, the patient is referred to the Medical Ongoing Service.
Treatment with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy (weekly cystplatin 40 mg/m2) followed by gynecologic brachytherapy is proposed and accepted.
The patients evolution was satisfactory, with no significant toxicity.
The evaluation of tumor response by CT showed complete tumor remission and persistence of tumor dismissal of the abdominal cavity with hypodense content inside, in relation to a known secondary tumor.
To avoid possible future complications in the gynecologic tumor committee it was decided to perform total hysterectomy + double adnexectomy + incisional hernia repair, which was performed without immediate incidents.
Three weeks after surgery, the patient came to the Emergency Department complaining of intestinal butterfly and occasional pain episodes along with vaginal bleeding.
At the control CT, the patient presented a hydro-aerial collection suggestive of postoperative pelvic abscess, together with significant small bowel dilatation with delayed transit suggesting intestinal occlusion.
She required several interventions for adherence syndrome and is currently admitted for adherent syndrome.
