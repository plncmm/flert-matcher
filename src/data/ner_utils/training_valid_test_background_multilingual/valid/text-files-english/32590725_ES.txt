A 27-year-old woman, G2P1, 33 weeks gestation with short intergenic period, was admitted with COVID-19 in a local hospital of 166 beds.
She was admitted to the dilation and delivery room for continuous fetal monitoring; internal medicine service was consulted for joint care.
The state of the mother progressively worsened and she was admitted to the ICU where she was hospitalized.
The patient presented worsening with anemia and underwent a transfusion with 1 unit of packed red blood cells, and prophylactic treatment with low dose heparin was initiated.
On day 5 of hospitalization, the need for ventilation had to be increased.
The ICU team considered placing the patient in the prone position or position toward another center for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complicated by pregnancy.
It was decided to proceed with the delivery to improve the mother's coping.
The empty room adjacent to the patient in the ICU was used for vaginal delivery equipment and equipment for a cesarean delivery.
Thus, in case of maternal or fetal signs of emergency delivery, this could be performed in the same ICU.
The patient received prophylactic anticoagulants with a low dose of subcutaneous heparin, which was withdrawn during labor induction.
Heparin was considered to have a minimal effect on bleeding, which could be reversed if necessary.
Corticosteroids were not administered for fetal lung maturity.
With viral pneumonia, the medical team considered that the risks to the mother outweighed the benefits to the fetus at 33 5/7 weeks of gestation.
Tests at that time for this case indicated that‚ñÅsteroids are not recommended for gestational age above 32 weeks.
Although the patient's condition continued to worsen, it was considered an acceptable candidate for labor induction.
The decision was made based on the identification of a patient with vaginal delivery at term without complications 11 months before, and on the fact that she had contracted and relaxed 0 to 3 cm.
On the morning of induction, an ultrasound confirmed the presence of a ceftazidime and 25 micrograms of misoprostaxis were administered intravaginally.
5 hours later, dinoprostone was administered because the patient had tachysystole with misoprostaxis without changes in the cervix.
The ability to withdraw dinoprostone in case of recurrent tachysystole or fetal intolerance to childbirth was considered an advantage.
During the latent phase of labor, fetal tachycardia occurred, with variable decelerations for 11 minutes.
Fetal heart sounds returned to normal with accelerations with repositioning.
During delivery, the patient was deeply sedated with propofol, midazolam and fentanyl and did not require additional sedation.
Seven hours after the administration of dinoprostone, an amniotomy was performed when the patient presented a 5 cm dilatation and the effacement was 80%.
An internal pressure catheter was placed.
It was not necessary to place any electrodes on the fetal scalp because the fetus could be easily monitored.
The patient progressed without the need for oxytocin; 3.5 hours later she presented 9 cm of dilation, 90% effacement and station 0, with variable fetal decelerations.
The fetus had another variable, with a minimum of 60 l.p.m.
and return to baseline after 90 seconds.
With the following contraction, the variables per capita had a minimum of 70 p.m.
A cervical examination revealed that the cervix was completely dilated and erased, with the occipital between +1 and +2.
Fetal pulse showed variable decelerations.
The patient was placed in a frog position.
A wedge pillow was available in the delivery room, but it was considered that there was enough room for maneuvers due to maternal position.
Before placing the forceps, the patient received a bolus of fentanyl.
The fetus was in the anterior occipital region and a 12-inch Simpson forceps could be easily applied.
The child was born easily with a single push and the perineum intact.
The neonatologist and intensive care staff who attended the delivery indicated that the patient responded to a vacuum-assisted birth, lifting her hand and opening her eyes briefly.
During delivery, a narrow umbilical cord was observed.
The newborn was assigned to the neonatology team waiting.
The Apgar scores were 3 at 1 minute, 5 at 5 minutes and 5 at 10 and 15 minutes; the weight of the newborn was 2,430 grams.
Venous gas could only be obtained from the cord, with a pH of 7.39.
The total time between induction and delivery was 14.5 hours.
The patient's husband was not allowed to attend the delivery in the ICU due to COVID-19 hospital restrictions.
The newborn was intubated after birth for about 24 hours.
No tapering was performed.
Neonatal tests for acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were negative at 24 and 48 hours of life.
The results of a chest X-ray were normal.
Amniotic fluid, placental surface and breast milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
The patient's husband could visit the neonatal ICU after both the patient and the newborn were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Our institution required the mother to give a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 in successive tests separated 24 hours before she could be in contact with the newborn in the neonatal ICU.
This occurred 22 days after the initial positive test.
The newborn was discharged at 36 2/7 weeks of postmenstrual age.
It should be noted that the patient's assisted breathing was stable during dilation and delivery, with values between 45% and 50% of FIO2.
The condition improved within one hour after delivery, with an FIO2 of 35%.
The patient was four more days on assisted breathing for a total of 9 days on mechanical ventilation.
She was discharged on day 16 of hospitalization with enoxaparin prophylaxis for 4 weeks.
