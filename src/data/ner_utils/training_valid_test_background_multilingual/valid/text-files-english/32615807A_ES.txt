A 50-year-old woman, with no known history of disease or drug use, was hospitalized in our center for fever, chills and dry cough.
Upon admission, blood pressure was 130 mmHg, pulse 80 l.p.m., temperature 2 Â°C, and oxygen saturation (in room air) 95%.
Initial examination revealed no abnormalities.
The initial ECG did not show results outside normal.
Due to the pulmonary involvement evidenced in thoracic CT, the patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and heparin as prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis at standard doses.
No electrolyte disturbances were observed during hospitalization.
On the fifth day of hospitalization, the physician decided to discharge the patient and treat him at home.
During discharge, the patient suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and died after ineffective resuscitation.
