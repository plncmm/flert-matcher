Anamnesis A 60-year-old man, a 25-year-old ex-smoker, for approximately 20 years (ICAT 40 paq-year), with no other relevant personal history, who came to the emergency room in July 2014, complaining of constipation.
6cm thickened abdominal examination showed hypogastric swelling and significant pain in the left iliac fossa▁Complementary tests. Abdominal CT scan was performed in the emergency department with iv contrast showing a parietal thickening of the colon
-Through the results, an outpatient chest CT is requested, as well as a complete laboratory analysis and a preferential appointment in the Digestive Department.
-The patient is placed underneath the preferential treatment for an anal margin of 18 cm, with a friable mass occupying almost all the circumference of a small lumen which bleeds at the base of the
Biopsies of the area were taken.
-No diagnostic metastases were observed in the chest CT. The pathological result was adenomatous lesion with high-grade dysplasia.
Treatment Given the results of complementary tests, the patient is referred to surgery and days waiting for intervention, August 4th, refers to the emergency department with abdominal distension, nausea and constipation, and absence of flatulence 3
An abdominal X-ray showed dilation of the entire colonic frame from a sigmoid of up to 8 cm in cecum with fecal-aeroanterior content with competent ileocecal valve, so it was placed in a surgical rectivite.
Finally, the next day a sigmoidectomy was performed with T-T anastomosis and phantom ileostomy.
The anatomopathological result was: Stenosing rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma (with endoprosthesis), moderately differentiated with signet ring cell superimposed on the wall (pT4).
Perineural and vascular lymph involvement was observed in 24 isolated lymph nodes (pN1).
Free-to-operate.
After the results, the patient was referred to the outpatient clinic of On, with clinical judgment : colon adenocarcinoma pT4pN1, stage III, so adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy FOLFOX scheme x 12 cycles was prescribed.
A new extension study was requested, with negative CEA and negative Ca19.9 tumour markers, in order to confirm the diagnosis.
Adjuvant Folfox was started in September 2014 with excellent tolerance.
feverish feverish fever without any association.In the last FOLFOX cycle, the patient came to the emergency room after sudden onset of dyspnea at rest, with persistent dry cough and severe respiratory failure
On examination, the patient had tachypnea at rest at 26 bpm with satO2 88-90% with a 2 bpm contribution.
Respiratory auscultation revealed marked hypophonesis in both hemithorax with dry crackles in both bases and right midfield defective lateral plane.
AngioCT was performed on admission after obtaining a high degree D. In this case, the patient discards and after reviewing the images, there was a predominance of bilateral bronchoalveolar obstruction with diffuse ground glass with effluent areas,
Other signs of moderate PH.
Blood cultures, sputum cultures, antigenuria of Neumococo and Legionella, PCR of respiratory viruses and serology with negative results were obtained during admission.
The patient, despite empirical antibiotic therapy, corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy with VM 31% presented tachypnea 30 rpm and sat 89%, without fever or acute mucocupurulent expectoration or increase in phase reactants.
Finally, the patient is admitted to the▁Pneumology Department with clinical judgment: `severe acute respiratory failure secondary to acute chemotherapy pneumonitis (chymic pneumonitis)', because these drugs can be associated with salts
In addition, in comparison with previous radiological studies, he highlights that the July 2014 thoracic CT scan was strictly normal without pleuropulmonary alterations or mediastinal adenopathies.
During admission, the patient was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, bronchodilators and acetylcysteine 600/8hours, progressing slowly but favorably, despite poor tolerance to minimal efforts (cam se).
Finally, discharge with basal arterial gas is decided 63, requiring home therapy. The patient goes to reviews both in the▁Pneumology Department and in the Outpatient Clinic.
After more than one year in revisions, the patient is slowly improving, without requiring physiotherapy during the 24 hours of the day, and with 10 mg of prednisone every 24 hours,▁tolerating any exercise.
The next review in▁Pneumology will assess withdrawal of medicated therapy.
As for reviews by On, the last May 2016 revised the patient with normal abdominal CAT scans and lower limbs showed no evidence of analytical abnormalities with tumor markers, highlighting persistence of neuroIItoxicity.
