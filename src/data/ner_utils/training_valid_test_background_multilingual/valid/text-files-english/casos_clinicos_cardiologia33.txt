A 59-year-old man came to the emergency department with a history of discomfort in the last month and confusion in the last 3 days.
She reported no fever or localized ailments.
The patient had a history of poorly controlled diabetes, dyslipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder.
He was agitated, his temperature was 38.3oC, cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal and he had mild edema in his ankles.
The most significant laboratory data were 18,700 leukocytes/mm3, 10.4 g/dL hemoglobin, plasma glucose 750 mg/dL and C-reactive protein 12.6 mg/dL.
A hemocultive was extracted, admitted with the presumptive diagnosis of non-obstructive hyperosmolar syndrome secondary to acute infection, and treated with intravenous fluids, insulin and cefuroxime.
There was improvement.
On the third day, the clinical microbiology laboratory detected growth of small gram-negative bacilli in both hemocultive forms.
One day later, they grew in blood agar and chocolate agar plates, but not in the MacConkey agar plate, tyrosic, elevated, non-hemolytic, multisized colonies.
Colonies tested oxidase positively and negative for lacatalase, indole and urease.
The isolate was identified using the API 20E (bioMérieux) and RapIDNF Plus (Remel) systems as Pasteurella haemolytica and was reported to be sensitive to cefuroxime.
The patient was re-questioned and he told that he had a cat at home that had bitten him several times in the last month.
During the rest of his hospitalization, the patient suffered a fever but had several episodes of pulmonary congestion.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation.
When the patient was admitted, he was transferred to a rehabilitation unit where he completed a 10-day course of cefuroxime.
One week later, he was admitted again due to increased dyspnea and peripheral edema.
She was treated with diuretics with minimal improvement.
The TTE was repeated, which this time showed significant aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Due to the persistence of pulmonary congestion, the patient was referred for surgery to replace his aortic and mitral valves.
During surgery, small vegetations were observed in the aortic valve.
The criteria of hemocultives require the isolation of a microorganism of the type of Streptococcus viridans group, Streptococcus bovis, HACEKcomiken group with Staphylococcus hocorrans or isolated in Haemophilus, Actinum
Therefore, the extraction of more than one blood culture before starting antibiotic treatment and the correct identification of blood isolates are of paramount value for diagnosis of colitis.
Valve vegetation was cultured, but no growth was obtained; there was no growth in the additional hemocultives that were extracted in the second admission.
Negative culture infective endocarditis can result from the use of inadequate microbiological techniques, infection by very demanding pathogens (such as Bartonella, Brucella or Chlamydia species), or antimicrobials prior to blood culture.
In the present case, the 16S rRNA amplicon sequence of the valve tissue had a >99% agreement with that of Haemophilus aphrophilus.
Subsequently, the blood isolate previously identified as Pasteurella haemolytica was identified as H. aphrophilus.
In the present case, the «error site» began with an insufficient inoculum to the tubes with oxidation/ferment medium, which resulted in the▁erroneous identification of the isolate as «negative identification of non-specific bacteria» in case.
Another possible cause of confusion for clinical microbiologists is that H. aphrophilus is one of the only two Haemophilus species (the other is Haemophilus ducreyi) that does not require growth in blood agar (factor V).
Haemophilus and Pasteurella genera belong to the same family (Pasteurelleae) and misidentification of H. aphrophilus as Pasteurella is well known using commercial identification equipment.
In the present case, it is possible that the correct identification and information of the isolate would have alerted the clinician of the possibility of having the infection and having led to appropriate treatment in the first hospitalization.
Therefore, it could have prevented the progression of valve destruction and the need for valve replacement.
