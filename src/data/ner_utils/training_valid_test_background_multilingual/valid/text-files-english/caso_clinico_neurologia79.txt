She was brought to the Emergency Department by her daughter, who reported that for 3-4 weeks she had behavioral changes (irritability, depressive mood, emotional lability, as well as decreased her habitual activity of speaking), hypoxia,
In addition, disorientation over time, predominantly in the evening, and difficulty in recognizing family members.
He had also started with intentional tremor in the right hand, with a flexion posture of the elbow and of that hand, initially intermittent, later fixed, and with arrhythmic▁clonic movements.
In addition, gait instability with a tendency to latero and retrofit, short steps, frequent blockades and trunk▁rigidity that had progressed until that same morning was completely blocked while going to the bathroom.
In the last 48 hours he had presented three episodes of urinary incontinence.
The family related the onset of symptoms after the news of an important illness of a brother.
No family member had presented a similar picture.

Regular general condition
Eupneic.
Colourless and normoperfused.
Well hydrated and nourished.
There were no alterations in the general examination.
Neurological alteration: conscious, inattentive in form, intense distractability, partially collaborating.
Unsuitable behavior: unmotivated.
Less than enough language and coherent content most of the time.
Language blocks, moderate dysnomia, repeats adequately,▁obeys partially simple orders, does not▁obey complex orders.
Oriented in person, disoriented in time and space.
Anterograde memory and impaired learning ability.
Regrettably fixed.
Palmomentonian foot or grasping not present
Cranial pairs: normal except for mandibular myoclonus .
Motor: myoclonus triggered by movement and tactile stimulation in upper and lower limbs predominantly in the upper limbs, arrhysters stimulation.
Increased tone in the MSD without clear paresis in the extremities, doubtful wheelchair full.
RLL in dystonic position with dorsal flexion and foot inversion.
Orotracheal intubation was symmetrical ++/+++, bilateral flexor CPR.
Feasibility: no gross alterations.
Cerebellum: severe ataxia.
Gait: base increase of support, inability to walk independently with tendency to retrofit.
▁Complementary tests • Biochemistry, blood count without relevant changes except CRP 15 mg/dl without leukocytosis and VSG 120 mm.
Thyroid hormones, vitamin B12, homocysteine and folic acid were normal.
• Tumor markers: PSA 7.83 ng/ml (free PSA 1.76), Ca19.9, CEA, Ca 125 and enolase normal.
• CSF: opening pressure 17 cm H2O.
Leukocytes and proteins equal 0 c.
Sterile culture, gram and VDRL and negative cytology.
14.3.3: positive.
• Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
• ECG: sinus at 90 bpm.
• CT: small vessel disease and age-dependent involutive changes.
• Cranial MRI: in diffusion there is cortical restriction of the left hemisphere, of pre-existing occipital, insular and upper frontal; and right frontal cortical and putamen in the head of the tail and anterior portion.
Signaling in T1 and T2.
Small vessel chronic ischemic disease II.
Global▁atrophy of supratentorial predominance.
• EEG: diffuse slowing of activity, although modifiable with stimulation, and intercalated, acute waves of triphasic morphology and generalized distribution, without clear periodicity.
Diagnosis sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Treatment Non-contrast enhanced myoclonus with clonazepam.
Opening vs. 48 hours, exploration was substantially modified, with marked sleepiness, which responds to the call with the eye, but does not respond to simple or complex orders.
Very scarce language, impoverished and restrictive, emitting only monosyllables.
No changes in the rest.
The EEG was then repeated, showing base slowing and the appearance of generalized periodic triphasic activity.
In the following 3 weeks, the patient progressively deteriorated, fever that did not respond to antibiotic treatment, together with deterioration of renal function and various laboratory abnormalities.
His family decided to limit the therapeutic effort, given the prognosis of the patient, and he died 3 months after the onset of the disease.
