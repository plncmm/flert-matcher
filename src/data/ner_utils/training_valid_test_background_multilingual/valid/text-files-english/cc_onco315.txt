Anamnesis A 68-year-old man, born in Extremadura but living in Mallorca, married and with a daughter.
The only pathological antecedent of interest was type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) since 2010 treated with metformin, with good glycemic control and no complications.
Diagnosed in March 2014 of stage IV sic cancer cT3N1bM1 (hepatic metastases and doubtful peritoneal implants) with laparoscopic subsigmoidectomy segment III is performed by goals that in April 2014 .
The pathological study showed a low-grade pT3N2b (7/20) M1 sigma adenocarcinoma (bilobar liver disease), free surgical margins and no peritoneal disease.
Molecular study: KRAS WT, PI3K WT, BRAF WT, NRAS WT.
In June 2014 he was included in the VISNU-1 clinical trial and randomized to the FOLFOX-6+BVZ branch with good tolerance to it presenting in September 2014 a partial radiological response of liver metastases.
Portal embolization was performed in October 2014 and right hepatectomy was performed in second time (November 2014).
As a complication, edematous ascites and deterioration of the general condition led to the non-continuation of treatment with supplementary chemotherapy.
He left the clinical trial and started controls.
In April 2015 she presented liver and probable pulmonary progression 5 months after surgery and 6 months after the end of chemotherapy, so having recovered her general condition (performance status 1) she started again with good clinical tolerance according to FOL scheme.
In August 2015 she presented paradoxical response, with bone progression (left iliac palatal lesion) with soft tissue mass but partial response of liver disease, which was added to cetuximab treatment.
She also underwent analgesic radiotherapy (20Gy, 5f between 7 and 11 September).
The last chemotherapy was administered on October 7, 2015.
After 2 cycles of treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital in Octubre in 2015 for a rapidly progressive cutaneous necrotic ulcer in the right anterior tibial region despite local and systemic treatment with levofloxacin for 7 days (laucoma).
The patient reported no fever or other symptoms, and had not presented trauma or insect bite.
Physical examination revealed a necrotic cutaneous ulcer in the right anterior tibial region that initially presented erythematous margins and fundus with cellular detritus and fibrin but without signs of overinfection.
Physical examination revealed no other visible skin lesions.
▁Complementary tests Blood analysis showed no elevation of acute phase reactants and glycated hemoglobin was requested to rule out complications arising from their DM, the same being normal (6.5%).
An ultrasound showed infectious colitis, probably myositis/inflammatory.
Arterial Doppler ultrasound was also performed, which was normal.
During the evolution of the clinical picture, a control ultrasound was requested, which showed nonspecific arthritis with myositis and superficial and deep fasciitis.
Different biopsies were performed resulting from acute nonspecific inflammation with abscessed microorganisms (on one occasion with a fungal structure PAS + without clinical impact) with positive culture for multiple microorganisms oriented as contaminants.
To complete the study, a computerized axial tomography (CAT) was requested, describing a previous non-left iliac metastasis with restaging, which showed the appearance of a pulmonary nodule in the LSI and stability of the other two effusions.
Diagnosis Pyoderma▁gangrenosum as paraneoplastic syndrome of colorectal carcinoma.
Hepatic and bone progression of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Treatment Given the complexity of the clinical picture multidisciplinary assessment (Derma, Sepsis Unit, Microbiology, Pathological Anatomy, General Surgery, Traumatology and Ontology) required.
Treatment was initiated with antibiotics and prednisone at a dose of 1mg/kg/day, and surgical debridement was performed to avoid overinfection.
With these measures, the maximum response was achieved, with stabilization of the disease.
Given the stability of the clinical picture and the suspicion of pyoderma ureterorenous associated with the progression of carcinoma, it was decided to start▁cyclosporine A at a dose of 5mg/kg/day of colorectal function, with excellent cutaneous reactivity after secondary hypertension.
The residual disease despite progressive improvement of necrotic skin ulcer, the patient presented deterioration of the general state with performance status of 3 that made unspecific treatment for the cause of the paraneoplasic syndrome to be rejected.
