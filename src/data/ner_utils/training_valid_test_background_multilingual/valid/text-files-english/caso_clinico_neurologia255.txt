Anamnesis A 58-year-old patient with a history of bacterial endocarditis complicated with bacterial meningoencephalitis, discitis at the level of D12-L1 and left parietal ischemic stroke in 2006, with no sequelae, ex-smoker.
In September 2011, the patient presented with lumbar pain radiating to the anterior aspect of the right thigh, with poor response to analgesic treatment, often motivating the emergency department.
Since January 2012, it associated progressive weakness in the right ear, requiring support with gestures for ambulation, and sensation of ipsilateral numbness, especially with standing.
In the last month, the patient also reported feeling of numbness and weakness in the left side with walking, which improved after rest.
She did not report sphincter or other symptoms.
The patient provided an electromyographic (EMG) study, in which it was evident the presence of a radicular suffering of intense degree L4-L5 with data of active denervation, and a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the dorsolumbar spine in T2 sequence without contrast, in which a small discal protrusion D12-L1 is observed, without causing alteration of the spinal cord signal.
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Department to complete the study.
Physical examination normal vital signs.
Normal head and neck, adenopathies were not observed.
Heart attack, mental illness, mental illness.
Cholestasis of the lung: conserved mucus
Abdomen: blade, depressible, without masses or enlargements; inguinal lymphadenopathy was not observed.
neurological damage: a level of the right thigh.
Global weakness in the right lower extremity, predominantly distal, with a fallen foot.
Weakness for left foot dorsiflexion
Abolited muscle bundles in the right lower limb and hyponatremia in the left lower limb.
Cutaneous-plantar bilateral flexor contracture.
Normal walls and walls.
Bilateral Lasègue sign at 45°. Mark very difi▁cult, bilateral stenosis, with right predominance.
▁Complementary tests • Blood tests with blood count, biochemistry, HbA1, thyroid hormones: normal.
• Coagulation: fibrinogen 541 mg/dl.
• Globular sedimentation rate: 49 mm.
• Vitamin B12: 4.789 pg/ml.
Folic acid: 1.9 ng/ml.
• Ankylosing agents specifically target: negative.
• Immunological study: antinuclear antibodies 1/160, the rest negative.
• Serology retrovirus, loes, Borrelia, Brucella: negative.
Serology herpes simplex virus: IgM negative, IgG positive.
• Cerebrospinal fluid study: leukocytes 165 c.
• Cerebrospinal fluid cytology:▁lymphomonocytic pleocytosis.
There was no evidence of tapering cells.
• Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm.
• Chest X-ray: no data on pleuropulmonary pathology.
• Radiography of the spine: disc disease data D12-L1.
• Electroneuromyogram (ENMG): data of active denervation in almost all muscles explored in the lower limbs except at the level of left L4, in part of the muscles voluntary contraction of the right lower limbs with voluntary C8UM muscles
• Meagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical-dorsal-lumbar spine with and without contrast: focal spinal cord injury at the height of the L1 vertebral body of approximately 2 cm, length and 8 mm anterior.
After contrast administration, peripheral enhancement and central hypouptake were observed.
It was associated with centromedullary edema, which extended from D11 to the medullary cone and slight medullary expansion, although there seemed to be depression of the pial surface in the central zone of the lesion.
Dual intraspinal nodular lesion adjacent to the right S1 root.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the dorsolumbar spine, T2 sequence without contrast with a spinal cord injury at the level of the vertebral body L1, affecting the anterior and central portion of the conus medullaris.
After contrast administration, peripheral enhancement and central hypouptake were associated with spinal cord edema.
• Laminectomy with lumbosacral root biopsy: metastasis of carcinoma.
Immunohistochemical study showed immunopositivity for cytokeratin 7 and TTF1, suggesting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma as the first possibility.
• Toco-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT): subcarinal necrotic lymphadenopathies and right hiliar were observed.
Chronic bilateral basal pleural thickening.
No masses were found in the lung parenchyma.
Small bilateral renal cortical cysts.
Perirenal lipomatosis.
Diagnosis of Lumbosacral roots in metastatic carcinoma.
Carmatosis meningeal
Treatment and evolution With the diagnostic suspicion of lumbosacral plexus disease, the patient was admitted to complete the diagnostic study, initially requiring analgesic treatment.
A battery of complementary tests was performed, among which the spinal MRI study highlighted, which demonstrated the presence of spinal cord injury associated with perilesional edema and heterogeneous contrast uptake, which was consistent with dexamethasone treatment associated with the lesion.
The patient underwent surgery for biopsy and excision of the lesion.
During the intervention, a thickened lumbar root, with a color ̈, thickened and granulous aspect was observed, which was thinning at L1 level and bifurcated at D12, so that only a histological study could be performed.
With the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of origin (probable lung adenocarcinoma), the case was discussed with the Department of Unknown On evaluating radiotherapy treatment.
A few days later, without having started oncological treatment, the patient developed a confusional state with significant deterioration of the general condition, and died shortly afterwards.
