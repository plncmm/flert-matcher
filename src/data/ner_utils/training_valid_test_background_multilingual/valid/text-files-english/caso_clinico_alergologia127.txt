A 12-year-old girl who, in the context of a dog bite, received amoxicillin which was replaced at 72 hours by amoxicillin-ác.
Clavulanic acid (1 dose), with generalised urticaria, peak fever and odynophagia within 4 hours.
No mucosal involvement, no arthralgia or organic clinical symptoms.
It is classified as pharyngitis and it is decided to change to cefuroxime for 3 days. Because it worsens rash, it is replaced by a gradual disappearance of symptoms in 2 days.
During the betalactamic allergy study, prick test was initially performed, which was negative for minor determinants (MDM, PPL) and antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-ác.
Clavulanic acid) was tested intradermally with amoxicillin-ác.
Clavulanic acid showed a negative immediate response, but delayed positive response at 6 hours for amoxicillin ac.
Clavulanic with 2.5 x 2 cm erythema.
Subsequently, CAP is performed for antibiotics that are negative (<0.1 kU/L) and intradermal for minor determinants and penicillin that are negative, and late reading to amoxicillin that is newly positive, with erythematous reaction of 3.5 x 2.5 cm.
