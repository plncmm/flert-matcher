A 43-year-old female smoker with a smoking habit of 10 years/pack without personal or family history of interest, who, in September 2018, was admitted to another hospital due to progressive loss of muscle weight and weakness.
On admission, she was diagnosed with metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
At discharge she was still unable to stand, so she was supported by UHD and was under treatment with dexamethasone at high doses (8-4-8 mg) and third-level analgesics plus right upper limb incontinence plus a second seizure.
In recent days, a confusional syndrome with delusions of injury had also been added.
The patient had a PS of 4 and was oriented in person and partially oriented in time and space; the physical examination showed a significant cachexia, with left quadriceps conditioning, interosseous and eminent.
Generalized weakness stood out in the motor balance, with scores of 3 out of 5 on the ASIA scale in distal extremities and 4 out of 5 in proximal limbs.
Sensitivity was normal and there was no alteration in cranial nerves.
The rest of the physical examination was anodyne.
Among the complementary examinations performed in the other center, the following stood out: - brain MRI and cervical spines (18/09/2018): Cerebral and cerebellar metastases with hemorrhagic component, cerebellar ventricular hypertension, intracranial compression
Bone metastases in the first 3 dorsal levels.
- CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (18/09/2018): Multiple lesions with metastatic appearance in both lungs predominantly in the upper palatal fields, retroperitoneal liver arch, right adrenal gland
There, an ultrasound guided biopsy of one of the liver metastases (24/9/18) had been performed on 24/9/18. At the same time, a morphological and▁immunohistochemical study showed a metastasis of a highly symptomatic ALGFRul 1 + dexamethasone lung adenocarcinoma.
After ruling out spinal cord involvement with MRI of the raquis, holocrane radiation was started (10 lesions located x 3 Gy, ending on November 5, 18).
On October 31, 18, the patient received EGFR results, presenting a deletion on exon 19, so treatment with Erlotinib 150mg/24h was initiated (after informed consent).
At the same time, rehabilitation/physiotherapy treatment was initiated due to prolonged bedding syndrome and muscle weakness attributable to immobility and to taking Dexamethasone.
With these measures, the patient started a slow but evident improvement in her general and functional status, with good pain control and progressive recovery of mobility and personal autonomy, which allowed the progressive decrease in corticotherapy.
On November 18/18, with a dose of 2mg/day of dexamethasone, the patient presented a fever peak without accompanying symptoms, highlighting the sub-crypitant chest examination with respiratory therapy and complementary X-ray findings (empirical examination, urine, virus).
Despite the widening of the antibiotic spectrum to piperacillin-talocal recommendations, persistent fever episodes occur in 22/11/18 cases, with a clear clinical deterioration, and poor reactivity, drowsiness, desaturation up to 60%.
A chest X-ray was repeated, which showed an extensive nodular pattern in both hemithorax of new onset. Given the suspicion of pneumonia and ganazol-associated pneumonia, levofloxacin therapy was administered.
Despite the high administration rate FiO2 50%, the patient developed dysneic sensation and severe tachypnea, and was referred to intensive care unit for placement of a nasogastric tube.
With this maximum support on the floor, the patient stabilized.
The compromised respiratory situation prevented the performance of▁bronchoscopy for sampling and microbiological filiation in the acute moment, but a chest CT was performed on 11/20/18, which showed extensive bilateral involvement patchy and confluent increase of CSF showing a mild elevation.
From an initial need for physiotherapy with an FiO2 of 80%, a slow but progressive improvement in the nasal cavity was achieved at the level of repeated fever peaks, allowing passageway 13/12/18, and spectacles 4/12/18.
Microbiological analyses of both CMV infection (eraphylaxis, viral load) collected in the febrile peaks and sputum, Aspergillus DNA, cotrimoxa isolation, progressively removing the patient (11 showed a prophylactic situation).
A control toco-abdominal CT scan was performed on December 18, 18, 18, which showed resolution of the areas in ground glass and improvement of the metastatic nodules with partial response criteria. The patient was discharged with no symptoms at home on December 21, 18
