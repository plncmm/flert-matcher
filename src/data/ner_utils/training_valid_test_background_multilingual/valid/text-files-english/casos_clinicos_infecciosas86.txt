A 17-year-old male with no known drug allergies and no family, personal or epidemiological history of interest came to the emergency department twice due to coughing together with herrumbrous expectoration and fever of up to 40oC.
After a first clinical evaluation, with complementary tests (complete antibiotic susceptibility test, biochemical tests with renal function and C-reactive protein, anti-smoking coagulation tests, and 24-hour treatment), the patient was discharged with 750/8 hours of clinical
After 48 hours, the patient consulted due to persistent solid fluids and this time odynophagia appeared, together with the presence of lesions in the oral cavity that prevented her from eating.
In addition, he reported the presence of lesions in the genital mucosa and distal region of upper and lower limbs.
At this point he was admitted to the hospital due to infectious diseases.
On physical examination, the patient was in a regular general condition, affected by▁dermatological lesions, with stable consciousness (non-blood clot 105/70), heart rate 90 beats per minute, and good cough.
Eupneic at rest despite a baseline oxygen saturation of 89% (with nasal spectacles fixed at 2 minute) increased to 96%.
At the laterocervical level, the patient presented small bilateral lymphadenopathies smaller than 1 cm, not adhered to deep planes and slightly painful to the neck fixation.
He did not present neck stiffness or other meningeal signs.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic tones at 90 bpm without murmurs and vesicular murmur preserved with sibilants tapering of both lung fields.
A bilateral conjunctival injection and tear were observed.
In the otorhinolaryngological examination we observed in the oral cavity pseudomedullary lesions with▁greyish appearance and fibrinous▁exudates and vesicular lesions in different stages of evolution that prevented the opening of the oral cavity
In the genital region we observed pruritic vesicular lesions, without inguinal lymphadenopathy and without urethral▁exudate.
In the upper and lower extremities he presented cutaneous lesions in the form of erythematous maculae that did not affect palms or plants.
Additional tests were requested again: laboratory tests with autoimmunity study and chest X-ray, hemocultives, sputum culture, pneumococcal antigenuria and Leg prescriptionella spp.
The hemogram showed neutrophilia 7810 cells/uL with monocytosis 1860/uL, without leukocytosis and without alterations in red or platelet series.
Coagulation showed no alterations.
Blood biochemistry only showed an increase in CRP, reaching values of 48.38 mg/dl.
In the chest X-ray, an increase in density (which was not observed on the previous X-ray) was observed in the right parahilar region and was suggestive of interstitial alveolar infiltrate.
Empirical treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone IV 1 g/24 h and with a 100 mg/12 h intravenous antibiotic.
Differential diagnosis We will establish the differential diagnosis of a patient with pulmonary involvement and skin lesions.
• Adverse drug reactions: Toxicodermy or drug-related skin reactions (CADRs) are a group of skin lesions resulting from the administration of systemic drugs and their most severe form of presentation Stevens-J syndrome varies from erythema to mood.
It should be considered in the case of our patient, given the history of ingestion of levofloxacin prior to the appearance of lesions.
Epilepsy - secondary to pneumonia caused by atypical microorganisms (especially M. pneumoniae) - Skin manifestations such as erythema multiforme major, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)
In favor of this possible diagnosis we have both the clinical and radiological image suggestive of pneumonia.
• SJ necrolysis epidermis (epidermal▁polyposis) is characterized by severe mucocutaneous lesions characterized by extensive necrosis and damage to the epidermis.
They are usually related to taking drugs or infectious agents.
• Tuberculosis: Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon disease, whose manifestations are common and common: external inoculation (tuberculosis verzinis) tuberculis, dissemination by contiguity (scrofuloderma, abscess).
In any case, they are usually chronic lesions and, in the case of acute chest lesions caused by infection, in the context of miliary tuberculosis, they would be accompanied by marked immunosuppression and miliary pattern present in the x-ray.
• Sweet's syndrome: More common in young women.
There are often prodromes such as upper respiratory tract symptoms.
After a few days, sudden onset of high fever,▁malaise and skin lesions (erythematous▁papules and plaques, irregular edges, pseudovesiculose neck, well-defined shape) appear.
Analytical analysis showed neutrophilia and increased ESR.
Pulmonary lesions, however, are very rare, and neutrophilic alveolitis, pleural effusion or airflow obstruction may occur.
• Staphylococcal staphylococcal skin syndrome: Caused by S. aureus of the phage II group, type 71 and 55, which produces▁epidermal toxin.
It is a typical condition in childhood, in which after a localized infection staphylococci (ORL, airways), the cutaneous scalding appears with positive Nikolski sign.
• Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: In this entity we can find pulmonary involvement, specifically pneumonitis lepica, which usually appears at the beginning of the disease, dyspnea manifesting as the most frequent alveolar infiltrates parahilar.
It can be associated with cough, hemoptysis and fever, with cutaneous involvement appearing as photosensitivity, mouth sores, malar rash and discoid skin lesions.
Initially it would be diagnostic, however, cutaneous lesions are slightly different from those typical of lupus.
It is more common in women.
• Sarcoidosis: Pulmonary involvement occurs in 90% of cases.
Fifty percent are asymptomatic at the beginning, with bilateral hiliar lymphadenopathies, mediastinal lymph nodes and/or parenchymal infiltrates in the upper lobes, with a chronic and non-acute evolution as in our case.
Among the cutaneous manifestations, lupus pernio is the most characteristic, such as symmetrical, chronic and progressive plaque induration.
Other specific lesions are▁papular eruptions, plaques, nodules (erythema nodosum) and alopecia, lesions that have nothing to do with the case in question.
• Positive ANCA vasculitis: We include Wegener's disease, which usually presents with multiple cavitated pulmonary nodules, lesions in the otorhinolaryngological area and renal involvement Straopia and cavitary vasculitis associated with
In these cases, the cutaneous involvement is usually palpable purpura, and the pulmonary manifestations differ from those described in our case.
Once regulated in plant, we received the following results: • Analytical analysis with autoimmunity study (ANAS, ANCAS, FR), thyroid function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: normal
• Serial blood cultures: negative.
• Sputum culture: negative.
•▁Pneumococcal antigenuria and Legionella spp.
 Serologies cytomegalovirus, Ep reststeine virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, Coxiella burn positive to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Parvovirus, and HIV negative.
• Interconsultation with pathology and ophthalmology.
As for the▁dermatological picture, the diagnostic suspicion (joint between Infectious Diseases Service and▁Pneumology) was a syndrome of SJS, which can be presented as a complication in the context of M infection.
Topical treatment with▁steroids and symptomatic lesions were initiated.
The treatment of this entity is that of the underlying disease and fluid therapy, because the large injured areas can cause massive loss of fluids, proteins and electrolyte imbalance.
During admission she required supportive care during the first days and antibiotic treatment was ruled out after the arrival of positive serology for M. pneumoniae, maintaining monotherapy as monotherapy for 10 days.
The diagnosis of suspected M. pneumoniae pneumonia was confirmed, with probable secondary SJS.
The patient presented a favorable clinical evolution with improvement of both respiratory symptoms and▁dermatological picture, with resolution at discharge of lesions in oral and genital mucosa, leaving only minimal residual lesions at the level of upper and lower limbs.
Control laboratory tests showed a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants, and in the chest X-ray at discharge, there was resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate at the level of the right middle lobe.
▁Definitive diagnosis Community-acquired pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (CURB65 0) with Stevens-Jonhson syndrome associated.
