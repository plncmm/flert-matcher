A 16-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department at Lombardy, complaining of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm, which had begun one hour earlier.
The day before, she had had a fever of 38.3 °C, with fever of 100 mg nimesulide.
He did not report other symptoms, had no history and had no contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19.
His vital signs were normal, except for his temperature, which was 38.5 °C.
On chest auscultation, the heart sounds were normal, there was no pericardial friction and no▁anomalous respiratory signs.
No lymphadenopathy, rashes or areas of chest wall pain associated with anaphylaxis were found.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed inferolateral ST-segment elevation and transthoracic echocardiography showed hypokinesia of the inferior and lateral segments of the left ventricle, with a fraction observed pericardial effusion infer 52%.
Analyses showed an increase in cardiac troponin I ultrasensitive (9449 ng/L), creatine phosphokinase (671.0 U/L), C-reactive protein (32.5 mg/L) and lactate (276.0 mg/L).
Leukocytes were 12.75 × 109 per L, neutrophils 10.04 × 109 per L and lymphocytes 0.78 × 109 per L. Acute aspirin was administered for diagnosis of myo pain and coronary ICU with stenosis.
The pain gradually subsided, and after 2 h, it had become complete.
However, during the first night, the patient complained of chest pain; the ECG was repeated, but no relevant changes were observed.
Ibuprofen treatment was started.
600 mg three times daily and both symptoms and fever resolved.
Autoantibody and cardiotropic virus tests were negative.
On day 3, a nasopharyngeal swab test for acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, so treatment with hydroxychloroquine and antivirals was started.
Repeated measurements of the patient's troponin concentration showed a gradual reduction from a maximum of 16,862 ng/L on day 1 to 39 ng/L on day 8.
Inflammation markers also returned to normal values and ST-segment elevation was detected on ECG.
On day 11, after two nasopharyngeal swabs obtained on consecutive days were negative, the T2-weighted MRI T2-weighted STIR sequence showed consistent changes with the diagnosis of acute myopathic colitis.
On day 12, the patient was in good condition and asymptomatic and was discharged.
