A 70-year-old woman, independent for basic activities of daily living.
Usual smoker, pack-year index 65.
Personal history of advanced COPD with bronchial hyperactivity and recurrent respiratory infections since childhood.
She has been treated frequently with▁steroids, which is why she has steroid diabetes mellitus and secondary osteoporosis.
Five months before the current clinical picture, she required hospitalization in▁Pneumology due to exacerbation of her COPD.
Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated in sputum.
After applying the Bulpa criteria, it was considered a probable Aspergillosis invasive pulmonary (API) and treated with itraconazole.
During hospitalization, a deficit of IgG 1 and total IgG was observed.
At discharge, she required home care with prednisone 24 mg/24 h. At three months, she was hospitalized again in Neurology due to tetraparesis, from CMV diagnosed colitis to CMV diagnosed as infectious colitis.
After receiving treatment with Ganvir and Inmnoglobulin IV, she was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic hospital with a favorable evolution.
He was referred from this hospital after presenting with sudden dysarthria, syncope, left hemiparesis and deviation of the oral commissure to the right.
In the days prior to the current admission, he had presented headache with organic characteristics and cough with green sputum.
No fever thermometered.
Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient developed a fever, hypotension (AT 92/63 mmHg), tachypnea (HR 110 bpm), and tachypnea (FR 24 bpm).
Physical examination revealed dysarthria, left facial paralysis of central origin, hemiparesis and left hemihypoesthesia.
cutaneous-plantar extensor and indifferent right.
Generalized hypophonesis with roncus ̄s on pulmonary auscultation.
The patient also had lesions compatible with oropharyngeal candidiasis and ulcerated skin lesions in the lower limbs.
Rest of the examination showed no findings of interest.
Urgent blood tests were requested, highlighting leukocytosis (14,600/mm3) with neutrophilia (85"5% PMN), and a complete blood count within normal limits.
Arterial hypertension with chronic global respiratory failure.
Lactate 3"5 mmol/l.
PCR 44"7 mg/l.
Renal function and transaminases, stasis without abnormalities.
A chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral hiliar enhancement (right hiliar enhancement).
Described neurological parieity was observed on CT scan with intravenous contrast of the skull. Four hypooccipital lesions were observed on the right side and two hypodense halo (peri-lesional oedema): nuclei of the right base (23x19mm), paraventricular area).
She was admitted with the diagnosis of brain lesions to study thinking of infectious etiology, immunosuppression presented by the patient and the two previous admissions described above.
Treatment was initiated with pyrrim + antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical therapy was added with Linezolid 600 mg/12h and ceftriaxone 2 gr/12h to cover the most common pyogenic etiology.
Differential diagnosis The most common intracranial lesion in adults is metastasis (up to 50%), usually presents as a single lesion, the most common origin being non-small cell lung carcinoma (20% of the times preceding the finding of the primary tumor).
Primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), vascular pathology, and inflammatory and granulomatous diseases are other potential causes of brain masses.
Brain abscess is a rare cause in the general population (incidence 0"3 to 1"3 cases/100,000 inhabitants), but its incidence increases considerably in immunosuppressed patients.
Up to 86 % of the cases it is possible to establish a predisposing condition, being the most frequent infectious pathology of the otological and naso-sinus area, followed by congenital heart disease or endocarditis (13%), previous lung disease (89%), meningitis (
Three mechanisms can be distinguished in its ethiopathogeny: A) by contiguity from the otorhinolaryngological area (50-60%), they present as single lesions; B) as a secondary haematogenous territory or as a multiple septic focus (20%).
In the general population, the most frequently isolated microorganisms are Streptococcus spp.
(3 and Enterococcus spp.
(14%) in the context of sinonasal and otogenic infections; and Staphylococcus spp.
(18%), by direct inoculation after neurosurgery or trauma, septic embolisms of endocarditis or congenital heart communications.
Fungi, fungal infections and mycobacteria constitute less than 2 % of the cases.
The results differ when referring to the immunocompromised population.
In these cases, the presence of opportunistic infections increases and the reactivation of latent infections become more important.
The etiology will depend on the epidemiological characteristics, as well as the type and severity of immunosuppression.
A multiple immunocompromised patient with multiple lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery should raise the possibility of multiple abscesses in the context of dissemination or reactivation of opportunistic microorganisms.
In our case, it was accompanied by a respiratory infectious disease and a bilateral pleural effusion, probably related to CNS findings.
In the presence of multiple brain abscesses with ring-enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT, it is essential to suspect toxoplasmosis.
It is a zoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii.
Reactivation of these agents results in severe infections in certain situations of cellular immunosuppression (usually HIV with CD4 count <100/mm3).
Pulmonary involvement is uncommon, and if it occurs, it usually produces a reticulum-nodular pattern.
Among the bacterial causes we must consider Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculosis spp.
Tuberculosis of the central nervous system includes three clinical forms: meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma and arachnoiditis.
In low prevalence countries, the most common clinical form is meningitis in the context of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection.
The presence of masses (tuberculomas) presents ring-enhancement in more evolved stages, resulting almost exclusively from endemic areas.
In cases of CNS involvement, pulmonary involvement was found in 50 % of the cases, the most common being apical lesions and presence of dernas as a result of reactivation of latent infection.
Non-species
CNS involvement can occur either alone (9 % of cases) or in the context of disseminated Nocardiosis (32 % of cases).
In these cases, the most common primary and concomitant pulmonary involvement.
Only 2% of cases are accompanied by cutaneous involvement.
This dissemination occurs mainly in the presence of certain factors: solid organ transplantation and hematopoietic progenitors, chronic glucocorticoid treatment, HIV CD4<100/ul, active neoplasia and diabetes mellitus.
Among the bacterial causes, pulmonary meningitis is affected in the context of encephalitis, and can produce cerebral abscesses in certain risk groups (elderly, neonates and immunosuppressed); however.
As for fungal etiologies, disseminated aspergillosis should be highlighted.
It causes CNS involvement in 10-20 %.
In the absence of adequate local pulmonary immune control (where neutrophils play an important role), it is possible to develop angioinvasion by mature hyphae, dissemination and distant seeding.
It affects almost exclusively patients with severe neutropenia (<500/mm3 neutrophils) caused by the underlying cause or after chemotherapy.
There are other fungal infections that can cause concomitant involvement of the lungs and CNS.
Both because of its low incidence, the epidemiological context and the type of immunosuppression are unlikely in the current clinical context.
After admission, a contrast-enhanced MRI with gadolinium was performed (pT1, pT2, FLAIR, DWI, Spectroscopy sequences).
Masses with ring uptake and diffusion restriction,▁surrounded by vasogenic edema, two in the right occipital lobe (24x23x26mm and 21x17x20mm), a very temporo-parietal abscess (27x21mm) suggestive of frontal pyogenic
Contrast uptake in the cortex and deep area of the cerebral hemisphere suggestive of subacute or microabscesse infarctions.
In order to rule out cerebral toxoplasmosis urgently requested serology for Toxoplasma (IgG and IgM negative), HIV serology, also negative; as well as normal lymphocyte subpopulations within normal limits.
The presentation of cerebral toxoplasmosis with CD4>100 is exceptional.
This, together with negative serology, allows us to rule out this etiological possibility because it suspends the pyrimony plus mental disorder.
Although the "tuberculomas" are almost exclusively found in endemic areas, we requested negative "interferon gamma release assays" (IGRA).
A complete blood count showed a normal neutrophil count (>1500/mm3).
This, together with the absence of other factors, makes the development of invasive aspergillosis unlikely.
Transthoracic echocardiography was requested and reported as normal. A CT scan of the chest with intravenous contrast confirmed the presence of multiple bilateral loculated pleural effusions.
It was decided to perform diagnostic sentinel node biopsy due to its greater accessibility and lower risk than CNS for biochemical study, cell count and microbiological.
The pleural fluid obtained has a moderate glucose consumption, predominance of mononuclear cells and meets Light criteria for▁exudate.
The sample was sent for Gram stain, culture in common media and mycobacteria, as well as PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection, which were negative.
Gram stain of pleural fluid showed a gram positive philate suggestive of non-branching.
Subsequently, growth occurs in culture of N. asteroides.
Cefipemogram showing pulmonary involvement, central nervous system and probably starting intravenous antibiotic therapy with imprim-methoprim is confirmed with 0.5enthoxazole (TMP/6-SMX), linezolid 600 mg/12h
Although initially it improves, then it progresses slowly from a neurological point of view, also presenting severe hyponatremia in the context of SIADH secondary to CNS involvement.
The patient remains unconscious until death occurs in the context of multiple organ failure.
Final diagnosis Disseminated Nocardiosis with pulmonary involvement, central nervous system and probably cutaneous.
