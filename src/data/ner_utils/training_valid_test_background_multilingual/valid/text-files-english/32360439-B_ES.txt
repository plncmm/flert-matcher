An 83-year-old woman with a history of frequent urinary tract infections, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and neuropathy came to the emergency department with fever, facial paralysis, babbling and reduced oral intake.
The initial vital signs were significant with regard to temperature (38.6 °C), pulse (94 l.p.m.
), blood pressure (172/64 mmHg) and ambient air saturation (9 .
Physical examination revealed left facial paralysis and babbling, without other neurological deficits.
A value of 2 was calculated on the NIHSS scale.
Blood tests showed leukocyte and▁lymphocytic colitis.
Urine analysis yielded results within normal limits; chest X-ray showed bilateral peripheral opacities.
Cranial CT did not reveal any acute alteration.
A craniomaxillofacial angiotomography did not show large vascular occlusions, with moderate focal stenosis of the MCA, as well as bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lung vertices.
Taking into account the fever and the outcomes, the diagnosis was established according to COVID-19.
A PCR test detected the presence of the virus.
No evidence was found of dementia or other inflammation markers.
The chest X-ray progressively worsened with bilateral infiltrates.
Hemocultive and urocultive showed no growth.
No arrhythmias were observed during hospitalization.
On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient had left hemiparesis and worsening of left facial paralysis with left hemiparesis.
Speech was normal.
A value of 16 was calculated on the NIHSS scale.
A new head CT scan showed a new moderate hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggestive of acute infarction.
The patient was considered to be too at risk for thrombolysis or neurosurgical intervention.
CT angiography was planned before starting treatment with Integrilin; however, her respiratory status worsened and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Shortly after, the family decided to end the treatment.
