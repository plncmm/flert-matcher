A 56-year-old male, born and raised in Rioja, who had been suffering from nodular and ulcerated lesions on the back of his left wrist for 18 months, with no painful or pruritic volume, associated with increased volume.
In the following ten days the lesions extended to the left shoulder.
For this reason, he came to a local medical center where he underwent biopsy of the lesions. The result was compatible with granulomas. He received anti-tuberculous treatment and extended right arm with scheme 1 for 6 months.H
Later, there were▁papular lesions in the trunk that did not produce pruritus or pain.
One month before admission he noticed acutely a pendulum fall of his right hand.
Due to these symptoms he came to our hospital indicating his hospitalization.
In her biological functions she reported having decreased by nearly 10 kg of weight in the last two months, and increased sweating associated with a feeling of thermal rise.
The patient was diabetic and poorly controlled hypertensive for 6 years, on irregular treatment with metformin and loartan.
She had poliomyelitis when she was a child with sequel paraparesis carrying wheels.
She presented a fracture in the distal area of the left radius 5 years before, after a wheelchair fall.
The patient installed the creation of pets, did not have sick relatives and denied contact with tuberculosis patients.
It worked in the production of macerated roots liquors.
On physical examination, blood pressure was 160/100 and the rest of vital functions were normal.
He was in regular general condition, edematous and overweight.
On the skin he had a 3 mm erythematous▁papule on his face, with crusted surface.
The chest and abdomen showed similar lesions but also some▁papules with a moisturized center (molluscoid▁papules).
Erythematous▁papules scattered in the anterior chest, some present superficial crusting and other central umbilication.
The latter are known as molluscoid▁papules.
The dorsal region of the trunk had the same▁papules, and also a verrucous plaque with erythematous edge at the right scapular level.
Erythematous▁papules scattered on the back at the right scapular level show a crusted verrucous plaque with erythematous edges, this being the only lesion of this type.
On the right hand, he had an ulcer with irregular edges, crusted surface, on an erythematous base at the back as well as on the fourth and fifth fingers.
In the forearm and arm on the same side, he showed some erythematous nodules and ulcers of similar characteristics but of smaller size that followed a▁lymphocutaneous pattern.
He also had significant edema of the entire arm.
In the left upper limb, the test was similar.
Ulcers on the back of both hands and an ulcerated erythematous nodule on the left wrist.
These lesions are accompanied by ulcers and nodules with similar characteristics in the upper limbs, suggesting a▁lymphocutaneous pattern.
In the articular system there was a decrease in the articular range in both wrists, mainly due to the presence of dermal lesions and edema.
The neurological examination was awake, oriented in time, space and person.
He had hypotrophy and hypotonia of both lower limbs and had a pendulum right hand.
The rest of the physical examination was normal.
Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin in 13 g/dl and leukocyte and platelet counts within normal limits.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm/h.
Serum creatinine, electrolytes and calcium were normal; glucose 228 mg/dl and HbA1C 10.4%.
The liver profile showed TGO 24 U/l, TGP 26 U/l, serial alkaline sputum 175 IU/l, gammaK and HTLV 6 samples for hepatitis/gp and albumin (GGTP) 247 IU/dl, proteins
Chest X-ray showed some calcifications predominantly parahilar, so a chest tomography was requested.
In the pulmonary window were found some bullae dependent on the second right lung segment, as well as an interstitial pattern in "emerged glass" with bilateral basal predominance.
Anteroposterior chest X-ray shows some calcified nodules for the hips.
Contrast-enhanced chest tomography confirmed the presence of these nodules, as well as an interstitial pattern in "meriled glass" in both bases.
Calcifications were evident in the mediastinal window.
In the hand radiography, in the right hand, a hypodense zone dependent on the distal epiphysis was evidenced, associated with a disruption of the cortical bone, at the level of the first speaknge of the fifth.
The fifth metatarsal showed a hyperdense aspect of the cortical bone.
Bilateral hand radiography, right hand shows signs of osteomyelitis at the level of the first digit of the fifth finger and fifth metatarsal.
An old impacted fracture was evident at the radio level in the left wrist.
In the left wrist, an old fracture impacted on the radius was observed in relation to the patient's history.
There was no joint involvement of the wrist on ultrasound.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a liver parenchyma with irregular edges and enlarged spleen.
Abdominal tomography confirmed this finding.
The patient underwent fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy, but no significant alterations were observed.
A random transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed and sent for mycobacterial cultures.
Electromyography showed findings compatible with multiple mononeuropathy.
A skin biopsy of one hand lesion was performed.
At this time, a clinical discussion was conducted with the specialties of internal medicine,▁dermatology and infectious diseases.
We are in front of a patient from the Peruvian jungle with▁lymphocutaneous syndrome, nodular lymphangitis or sporotrichoid infection, that is, a primary papular lesion with an ulcerated or nodular▁lymphoid tract in a certain patient.
This patient was treated as▁lymphoid TBC with antituberculosis therapy that partially improves but reappears, progresses and extends to the contralateral limb.
This is an interesting case because when the patient has a polio, he would not be displacing himself in the mountain, where he could have direct contact for inoculation or aspiration of some of the antecedents in the area.
However, the clinical history indicates as first possibility the infectious cause of fungal origin.
The head in our environment would be infection by Sporothrix schenckii.
This fungal disease may have cutaneous and▁lymphocutaneous involvement, and systemic involvement if the patient has some degree of immunosuppression, as in this case.
This disease is mainly acquired by direct trauma, skin wounds, and less frequently by inhalation of conidia of this inoculation.
Some authors report other routes of inoculation such as mosquito bites, cat scratch, reptile bites.
Other animals related to sporotrichosis are▁rodents (including rats, mice, squirrels), and armadillo.
The pathology of this easily infected infection appears to be rapid, usually a mixed granulomatous and pyogenic pattern, which could have been initially confused with TBC. Sporotrichosis should be differentiated in our environment from Leishmania infection.
Other diagnoses to consider would be: cutaneous tuberculosis, infection by other mycobacteria (Mycosis marinum), some forms of mycetoma, tuberculoid leprosy and more distant in our country, and▁chromoblastomycosis.
Among the mycobacteria, which was initially thought, one should consider mainly Mycobacterium marinum infection, which is usually confined to the skin, and is acquired after contact with fish contaminated with granuloma or granulomatous fish.
Non-tuberculosis infections (NSSI) can occur in the lungs, systemic organs, or skin.
It is the most common cutaneous manifestation of No. brasiiiensis.
Since there are many diseases that manifest this pattern, a biopsy of the lesions and culture of the same ones will finally help us to determine the origin of the▁lymphocutaneous syndrome of the patient.
Most of the time the patient has some occupational risk factor or lives in an endemic area for the acquisition of the causal agent.
The most common microbiological agents involved are Sporothrix schenckii, the most common agent of chronic▁lymphocytic involvement, a cutaneous manifestation of universal distribution and Peru reported in some regions.
Due to the origin of the patient, disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis should also be suspected, although identification of the abscess by direct testing is relatively easy and ulcerative lesions are predominant.
Cutaneous tuberculosis is uncommon with this presentation, being the most common▁lymphocutaneous lesion in other types of mycobacteria such as M. marinum, which is almost always associated with minor injuries in fishers (trabasins exposed to).
Another cause to consider in▁lymphocutaneous lesions is infection by Francisella tularencis, although this condition is related to hunting habits or contact with▁rodents such as hares or rabbits and has not been reported either by the patient.
Finally disseminated and endemic, chronic form is frequent paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis can also compromise the skin and have pleomorphic lesions; however, in progressive forms of histoplasmosis mucose and pulmonary involvement are also frequent.
EVOLUTION▁Cytodiagnosis of the crusted▁papules of the patient was performed, which was quickly reported as a suppurative granulomatous pattern.
This pattern oriented towards infectious etiologies. Two samples were sent for histopathology, a nasangeal biopsy of the verrucous plaque and a "affected" of the molluscoid trunk▁papules.
Histopathology of the skin of the first fragment shows a lower increase than below a scape-costra. There is evidence of▁epidermal hyperplasia and a dense inflammatory infiltrate that includes the papillary and reticular dermis.
It contains some areas of eosinophilic appearance located just below the epidermis, which, the greater the increase, present the formation of Langhans type multinucleated giant cells▁surrounded by a tuberculous granulomatous cuff.
In the second fragment, the smallest increase was observed in the epidermis with tendency to flatten and below it a dense inflammatory infiltrate covering the entire dermis and is associated with red blood cell extravasation.
The greater the increase, the formation of granulomas is observed under the epidermis; furthermore, some neutrophils surrounding these granulomas are observed.
These findings are described as a neutrophilic granulomatous pattern, consistent with the findings in cytodiagnosis. Special stains were performed, Ziehl-Neelsen staining was negative for acid-resistant bacilli.
With PAS stain, it was possible to observe asteroid bodies, which is a suggestive finding of yeast Sporothrix schenckii.
The skin biopsy culture was negative for mycobacteria and positive for Sporothrix schenckii.
It is worth noting that the culture grew on the sixth day after installation.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures were negative for both mycobacteria and fungi.
FINAL EVOLUTION The patient received amphotericin B 50 mg/d for three weeks, accumulating a dose of 1 100 mg, on the fifth day of treatment a remarkable flattening of the skin lesions could be evidenced.
Subsequently, the patient received itraconazole 400 mg/d, showing a favorable evolution.
Itraconazole is currently completing the second month of treatment, with favorable evolution of skin lesions on the back, anterior chest and extremities.
A new chest contrast will soon be requested to assess the evolution of pulmonary involvement, which cannot be ruled out despite negative cultures in the samples obtained by fibrobronchoscopy.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS Disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis with bone involvement and probable interstitial lung involvement and multiple mononeuropathy.
