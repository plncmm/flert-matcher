A 9-year-old girl with fever and headache was hospitalized for two days.
She was being followed up for a small congenital VSD (3 mm diameter).
She had no history of dental or surgical procedures.
Physical examination revealed body temperature: 38.5 °C, respiratory rate: 20/min, pulse: 110/min, blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg.
An intense holosystolic murmur on the left lower border of the sternum and signs of neck stiffness and positive Kig's stiffness were also observed.
The girl did not present other relevant characteristics.
There was no subungual haemorrhage, obvious protein/ skeletal enlargement; no focal neurological deficit. Laboratory data were as follows: leukocyte count 17 000/mm3; neutrophils 93 %; lymphocyte count 5dl; thrombocytes 225 gSG sediment
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) count was 22 neutrophils/mm3, 66 lymphocytes/mm3, protein content of 26 mg/dl and glucose 61 mg/dl.
Magnetic resonance imaging did not present any particular features.
Ceftriaxone was started due to suspicion of meningitis after lumbar puncture.
Towards day 3 of hospitalization, symptoms had completely resolved.
Since Gram staining of CSF yielded negative results, the PCR panel for bacterial/viral meningitis, the hemocultive panel and the urocultive panel were discharged on day 7. Ceftriaxone was administered.
Two days later, he was admitted again with fever (39.5 °C) and neck stiffness.
Laboratory tests showed: leukocytes 25 000/mm3 (92 % neutrophils with granulocyte-reactions), hemoglobin 11 g/dl, thrombocytes 216,000/mm3, VSG 55 mm/h and protein 16dl
On physical examination, the obvious origin of fever was not found.
The family refused the CSF examination.
An echocardiogram was performed to detect the origin of fever and tricuspid valve endocarditis with vegetation (10.7 mm x 6.6 mm) and IVC (3 mm diameter) with left-to-right shunt was found.
Cranial computed tomography was normal.
According to follow-up, neck stiffness resolved within 24 hours.
Two consecutive positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to bacteraemia were initiated with teicoplanin and gentamicin.
The vegetation on the tricuspid valve caused valvular insufficiency, so it was removed by cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, including tricuspid valvuloplasty four weeks later.
Antibiotics were interchanged after six weeks, once the hemocultives were negative for two weeks.
The patient was discharged with residual mild tricuspid regurgitation.
During the year of follow-up, she did not present symptoms.
