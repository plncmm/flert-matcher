A 52-year-old male affected by acute▁lymphocytic leukemia (APL) with positive Philaphia chromosome in chemotherapy treatment with an intravenous amphotericin B induction therapy who developed asahii was treated with lamivudine.
The fever resolved, although the sowings in liver and lung were detected by computerized axial tomography as disseminated calcified lesions.
In addition, the patient had maculopapular skin lesions that were biopsied and were positive for Triporon asahii.
Nine months after the diagnosis of acute ALL, the patient presented with ocular symptoms manifested as bilateral blurred vision.
Visual acuity (VA) was 0.9 in both eyes and biomycosis showed normal exploration for their age.
In the eye fundus, mild bilateral (1+) and several disseminated chorioretinal lesions were observed, in the posterior pole of the eye, located in the peripapilar region and in the posterior pole
Fluorescein angiography was performed, which revealed the activity of the lesions.
It showed early hypofluorescence and hyperfluorescence in late times in the foci of▁choroiditis.
After a systemic study that ruled out other causes of chorioretinitis, the appearance of lesions 1 and the persistence of the disease due to persistent pulmonary asahii were ruled out.
The therapeutic approach was performed in a consensus with the Hematology Service, which required eradication of all focuses for performing a bone marrow transplant to the patient.
Empirical treatment was initiated with systemic and intravitreal voriconazole (0.25 μg/0.1 ml) repeated on the third and sixth day in both eyes.
Subsequently, a weekly injection was performed in each eye for two months.
The response was satisfactory in the right eye, in which all lesions were inactivated, but partial in the left eye, since inactivation of all foci was not achieved.
A change of treatment to intravitreal amphotericin B in the left eye was decided.
After injection, the patient developed aseptic endophthalmitis and required urgent resection 23 g.
He also required cataract surgery two months after surgery.
After these complications, and due to the fact that the pathologist advises against bone marrow transplantation at that time, the patient refused to continue with any type of therapeutic procedure in her eyes.
After one year of follow-up, her VA was 1 in both eyes and activity persisted in one of the chorioretinal lesions of her left eye.
