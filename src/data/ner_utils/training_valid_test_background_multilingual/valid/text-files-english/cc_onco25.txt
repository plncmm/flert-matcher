Anamnesis A 48-year-old nonsmoker, asthmatic and hypertensive woman presented with a 6-month history of low back pain radiating to the right hip, with poor response to analgesic treatment and general syndrome.
Timely studies were performed and a lung adenocarcinoma was diagnosed with secondary obstructive atelectasis of the right upper lobe and stage IV by pulmonary, bone and cerebral involvement.
The molecular phenotype detects the mutation of the EGFR gene in exon 21 (L858R type).
After the administration of holocraneal radiotherapy (10 fr, 300 cGy/fr), it began in July 2014 gefitinib 250 mg daily.
Six weeks later, the patient came to the emergency department due to increased dyspnea, cough, and poor whitish sputum.
He did not report fever.
Physical Component The patient has a PS component of 1.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles of teleinspiratory detachment in the right base with decreased vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax.
Laboratory tests showed non-hypercapnic respiratory failure and mild leukocytosis (12,800 leukocytes/μL) with neutrophilia.
» Chest X-ray shows resolution of obstructive atelectasis of the LSD with appearance of interstitial pattern in the rest of the right hemithorax.
» The study was completed with a chest CT, which confirmed the resolution of obstructive atelectasis and a generalized decrease in bilateral multinodular metastatic pulmonary disease and multiple sclerotic osseous lesions.
However, despite the radiological improvement of the tumor, the development of a diffuse lung disease (especially right basal pulmonary disease) is observed, characterized by a diffuse increase in the pulmonary radiodensity in the diffuse glass of the septal thickening, probably of interstitial origin.
» Microbiológiocs studies: sputum cultures, blood cultures and negative serology for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumophila Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Diagnosis Interstitial lung disease secondary to gefitinib.
Treatment of suspected pneumonitis due to gefitinib was suspended. Treatment included corticosteroid therapy with methylprednisolone 60 mg/day and empirical antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin.
Cardiac arrest during admission was completed by CT, with complete radiological response.
The patient showed clinical improvement and after discharge a new chest CT was requested 2 weeks after the previous one.
This CT scan showed a decrease in lesions associated with drug toxicity (persistenting ground-glass radiodensity) and a practically generalized growth of pulmonary nodules and pleural effusion.
At this time, it was decided to start cisplatin and permetrexed at 75% of the dose.
As toxicity presents delayed emesis grade 1.
Progress was observed on the evaluation CT after the third cycle, so the decision was made to initiate the third line with ribavirin, paclitaxel and betaizumab.
Symptomatic improvement of dyspnea persists after initiation of treatment with ECPS 2.
The toxicities are asthenia, neutropenia grade III, alopecia and peripheral neuropathy, which require a dose reduction of 30%.
After the sixth cycle, a CT scan showed partial response with resolution of the pneumonitis, so the patient was switched to maintenance beizumab, with good tolerance.
