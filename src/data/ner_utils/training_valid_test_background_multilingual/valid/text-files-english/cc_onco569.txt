Anamnesis A 26-year-old male, with no history of interest, who came to the emergency department several times due to hypogastric pain radiating to the RIF and lumbar area.
It is related to constipation that requires enemas and laxatives for 2-3 weeks.
He says about 5 kg of weight loss over the past 2 months.
She has no other symptoms except for generalized abdominal pain, physical condition without relevant physical findings.
Liver edge between 2-3 cm with nodules, indurated.
A mass located at the FID level is also observed.
Rest of the examination showed no relevant findings.
For this reason, hospital admission is followed to continue the study.
▁Complementary tests » Biochemistry highlights: BT 1.34, GOT 81, GPT 140, GGT 246, FA 154, LDH 716.
» Blood count: Hb 15.8, leukocytes 11,620, PMN 74 %, platelets 238,000.
Coagulation: TP 51 %, INR 1.62.
» Normal thyroid profile.
Serology HIV, IGRA and hepatotropic virus negative.
betaHCG < 1.2.
» MT: elevation CA 125 121.1 (0.5-35); AFP, CEA, CA 15.3 CA 19.9, S-100b protein and PSA within normal limits.
» Proteinogram within normal limits.
Discrete IgE elevation.
» Regarding imaging tests, in the abdominal ultrasound performed, multiple lesions consistent with metastatic liver, pelvic disease, probably lymph node and hepatic hilium secondary to unidentified neoplasia could be observed.
» On chest, abdomen and pelvis CT, several pelvic peritoneal masses were observed, as well as lesions with peripheral uptake ring suggestive of liver metastases.
» A core needle biopsy of the inguinal mass was performed, which was finally reported as a demoplastic small round cell tumor.
» Small undifferentiated round cell trabeculae with scarce eosinophilic cytoplasm are observed in a fibrous stroma desmoplastic change.
» Cells have positive immunophenotype against desmin (with perinuclear point pattern), vimentin, weak enolase, CK AE1/AE3 and CD99 weak and negative against CD100 protein myogenin.
» The molecular biology study, reported later, has a positive result for the translocation EWSR1.
» The FISH technique is positive for translocation of the EWSR1 locus (22q22).
» The▁immunohistochemical study of WT1 shows intense positivity.
» Subsequently, the patient is discharged home after biopsy.
» He was admitted again due to abdominal pain refractory to analgesic treatment.
Symptomatic control and extension study are therefore performed.
» Bone scan with no evidence of metastatic bone involvement.
Ventriculography showed a normal LVEF.
Diagnosis Demoplastic small round cell tumor.
Treatment The strategy proposed was the initiation of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine for six cycles.
After three cycles, the patient required hospital admission due to pulsatile arthritis, febrile neutropenia GIV, thrombopenia GIII, and oromucositis GI.
Finally, completes the three remaining cycles. In the radiological evaluation at six months, the following stand out: » MRI abdomen and pelvis: marked partial response of the peritoneal lesion, as well as liver metastases.
» CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: significant reduction in the number and size of primary pelvic lesions and liver metastases.
Retroperitoneal and mesenteric adenopathies disappeared.
Partial response to treatment according to criteria consistent with sepsis 1.1 for primary and metastatic disease.
Given the response to treatment, the case is presented in a Multidisciplinary Committee for surgical evaluation.
Surgery R0 is not guaranteed, so it was decided to continue chemotherapy with ifosfamide-etoposide scheme for three more cycles.
After completing them, it was decided to consult the Spanish Group for Research in Sarcomas (GEIS), recommending to complete the year of treatment with chemotherapy and reassess and try local techniques.
After completing ifosfamide-etoposide scheme, rescue surgery is performed.
Patient was discharged home after one week.
The case is presented again in the Tumor Committee, specifying that the resection has been R2 leaving all the liver disease that is unresectable and a tumor pill on the right pelvic side.
Three months later, the patient was admitted again to the emergency department due to deterioration of general condition, tension ascites and liver failure due to tumor progression.
PET-CT: dissemination of liver, peritoneal metastases, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and▁incipient lung metastases, all suggesting tumor progression.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: tumor progression with liver metastases.
Evidence of peritoneal implants and presence of necrotic lymphadenopathy in pararectal fat.
Finally, given the patient's condition, it was decided to start comfort measures, with evacuating paracentesis and start of analgesic infusion for pain control.
One week later, the patient died.
