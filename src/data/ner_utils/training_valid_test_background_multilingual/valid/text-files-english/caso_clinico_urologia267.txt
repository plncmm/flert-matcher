Anamnesis A 50-year-old male patient with the following personal history: no drug allergies, no diseases of interest, no surgical interventions.
Toxic habits: smoker of 40 cigarettes a day.
He denies other toxics.
The patient comes from a concerted center for possible priapism.
She had penile swelling with pain of one month duration.
Previously to this clinical picture she suffered from recurrent urinary infections, urethritis and urethrorragia associated with acute urinary retention that required urinary catheterization.
She did not have fever or constitutional syndrome.
It is secondary to worsening of penile pain and a clinical picture of urinary obstruction in the last hours, despite medical treatment with analgesics, antibiotics and antibiotics.
It is asked about risk relationships or taking toxics or drugs, with absolute refusal by the patient.
Physical examination Good general condition, conscious, oriented and collaborating, good skin and mucous coloration.
Cardiopulmonary arrest unchanged.
Blurred and depressible abdomen, without masses or enlargement, painful to the hypogastric tenderness due to possible acute urinary retention.
There were no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Genital attachment: there is evidence of enlarged penis, signs of acute inflammation, with diffuse induration of both walls and faces.
Ulcerated lesions and nonmaloating whitish urethral discharge were observed at the glans level.
Testicles of normal size and morphology, without masses, and in the saccade and rest without alterations.
▁Complementary tests • penile Doppler ultrasound: in basal situation there are no calcifications in the sphincteric bodies, no stones in the dorsal region of the penis, normal diameter of the arteries, no lumens.
Arbitration and dorsal vein of the penis with normal morphology and clearly increased flow.
Penile tumescence grade III.
Vascular anomalies, arteriovenous fistulas, arterial stenosis in the arteries and pelvic arteries are not visualized.
Abdominal examination revealed iliac vessels with atheromatous walls, calcifications, and no morphological or hemodynamic stenosis.
These findings establish the diagnosis of low flow priapism.
Treatment Bladder catheterization is attempted, the same being impossible, given penile swelling and urethral▁exudate.
Because of this, temporary urinary diversion is performed, extra voiding urine decides clearly.
A gastric emptying system was created consisting of a vesicular body with pH 7.27, partial pressure of the anhydric acid (PaCO2) 35 mmHg and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 64 mmHg.
And sample of urethral▁exudate for culture.
An attempt is made to evacuate, although without results, and resort to the technique of instillation and ephedrine, without achieving detumescence, so finally it is decided to perform a caverno-spongyz fistula.
Therefore, it was decided to admit patients for observation and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment of the pipera-discharge syndrome.
After an evident improvement, with a decrease in penile volume, the patient is referred to his reference center to continue antibiotic therapy and subsequent outpatient study.
Diagnosis Low flow priapism and acute urethritis.
The patient was referred to our hospital because of incomplete paraplegia, pathological fracture of L4, after a week of radiating low back pain.
In this same center, an analytical was performed, establishing hemoglobin values of 8.8 g/dl and creatinine of 8.78 mg/dl and potassium of 7.12 mEq/l as the most significant data.
An abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) was performed, identifying a left adrenal mass of 3 cm, dilated small bowel and ascendant colon, bilateral paraaortic lymphadenopathy and bilateral hydronephric bladder with metastatic spinal cord lesion.
Trauma and surgical intervention to find a right nephrostomy catheter with impossibility of placing the left due to low ectasia. Dialysis (five sessions) was performed for treatment of acute renal failure and was admitted to the Columna Study Unit.
The laboratory results improved after several blood transfusions were required.
Subsequently, a left nephrostomy was placed, given the increased ectasia.
The study was completed with a cranial CT and a thoracic CT, with a result of pulmonary nodules in the left upper and left lower lobes of tumoral nature, corresponding to metastatic lesions.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine shows metastatic bone lesions at the level of D12, L1, L2 and L4, with L4 being especially compromised, both the vertebral body and the posterior vertebral elements with expansion of the spinal layers.
Finally, bone scintigraphy shows pathological focalities in the lumbar spine, right sacroiliac joint and right bone metastases.
These findings suggest symptomatic palliative treatment with 3D radiotherapy of the soft tissue mass at vertebral level.
Transurethral resection of the bladder was performed for the evaluation of the bladder lesion, resulting this fibromuscular tissue infiltrated by high-grade urothelial carcinoma.
The case was commented on in the case of tumors (doctors, oncologists, radiotherapists, pathologists and pathologists), urologists treating soft parts with chemotherapy at radiotherapy level 3D.
Traumatology assessment was performed using the Tokuha score (6 points), indicating conservative treatment.
The patient is admitted to the Palliative Care Unit, where he presents infection by Acinetobacter baumannii and dies one month after admission due to multiple organ failure.
