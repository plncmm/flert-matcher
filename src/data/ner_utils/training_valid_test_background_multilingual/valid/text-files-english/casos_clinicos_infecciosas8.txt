A 33-year-old woman with an intrauterine device (IUD) for four years as the only antecedent.
The patient had a two-month history of pain in the lower hemiabdomen radiating to the lumbosacra region, which worsens with efforts and postural changes, but without relation to the different phases of the menstrual cycle.
The patient developed dyspareunia, intermittent intermenstrual bleeding, occasional vaginal▁exudate and fever, without fever.
He had consulted for this on several occasions in primary care, having made several urine elements, a culture of vaginal▁exudate and a vaginal cytology without the existence of pathological findings in any of these tests clotrimazole and clotrimazole treatment.
Finally, the patient came to the emergency department due to persistence of the previously described clinical symptoms and fever.
On physical examination, the patient presented a conserved general state of health, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, highlighting in the general inspection only the presence of 38.3oC fever.
The abdomen was blando and depressible, generalized pain to the tapering, which was more intense in the lower hemiabdomen, where she presented defense against inferior peritonismus, without other associated data.
Bilateral percussion was negative.
Vaginal touch showed pain on cervical mobilization.
The patient did not present other significant findings in the examination by equipment.
The complementary tests initially requested were a simple chest and abdominal X-ray that were anodyne, an elemental urine in which there was no formation of leukocytes or nitrites and the βHCG was negative, an urgent hepatobiliary
Hemocultives and urocultives were also extracted.
The appendix to the described findings was requested an abdominal echography, in which there were findings compatible with a 6 cm abscess▁surrounded by inf performed in the right iliac fossa cecum level and visible abscess CT scan of the abdomen.
Differential diagnosis of a young woman with an IUD with a subacute picture of lower hemiabdomen pain, fever or fever and dyspareunia must always consider the possibility of an ineffective mental illness.
This entity requires a broad differential diagnosis including urological, digestive and other gynecological pathologies.
Among the urological diseases, the most important ones to consider given their high frequency are urinary tract infections and ureteral colic, although given the symptoms, exploration and complementary tests of our patient seemed unlikely.
In relation to possible causes of digestive origin, one should rule out the gastrointestinal manifestations, complicated diverticular disease, regional enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis. Additional tests are needed to rule out some of these options.
It is essential to make the differential diagnosis with other gynecological pathologies, such as ectopic pregnancy (our patient had negative urine βHCG), complicated ovarian cyst, guide complicated uterine fibroids and rule out other gynecological endometriosis options necessary to perform these neoplasias.
Antibiotic prophylaxis was started every other time we suspected the presence of an inflammatory pelvic disease. Vaginal swabs were performed (with samples sent for culture and PCR of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium).
Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT reported findings suggestive of extensive peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis with secondary carcinomatous ascites, along with a generalized inflammatory invasion of the gynecological structures in the myoextric pelvis and marked inflammatory signs in the uterus.
Abdominal CT c/c: "findings suggestive of extensive peritoneal and omental carcinomatosis with secondary carcinomatous ascites", along with a generalized invasion of the gynecological structures myxical vagina, markedly heterogeneous signs of uterine cervix.
Abdominal CT c/c.
Given these findings, the main diagnosis became peritoneal and omental extensive carcinomatosis, probably an inflammatory pelvic disease on candidiasis.
After the completion of the patient entered the gynecologic endometrial mycology border where an analytical dispatch was requested with tumor markers (including HE4 and the ROMA index), possible biopsy findings suggestive of micro IMCI were removed.
48 hours after admission, exploratory laparoscopy was performed to try to clarify the origin of the condition by taking samples for pathological anatomy.
During laparoscopy, a possible inversion colon was detected; therefore, open parietal resection was performed. The right iliac fossa was ruled out, as well as the presence of a colonic in situs inversus, and a right iliac thickening was found.
The different implants were biopsied and the laparotomy was closed.
The patient presented a favorable evolution with antibiotic treatment, remaining afflicted 48 hours after the beginning of the treatment and presenting progressive improvement of the general condition and decrease of the abdominal pain.
He also presented a progressive decrease in leukocyte count and acute phase reactants.
There were no remarkable alterations in the laboratory tests requested, and the tumor markers were negative, as well as the hemocultive, urocultive, the culture of vaginal▁exudate and the endometrial aspirate and the serological tests for HIV.
Given the favorable evolution and absence of post-surgical complications, the patient was discharged home after eight days of admission, waiting for the results of the pathological anatomy of the endometrial aspirate and surgical biopsies that would be decided.
Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 8 hours, and oral antibiotic treatment with 100mg every 12 hours was indicated. The patient was scheduled at seven days in the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up.
These reported the existence of abundant fibroleukaryotic remains with presence of structures compatible with Actinomyces spp.
The diagnosis of pelvic actinomyosis was modified to amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours orally.
The patient presented a favorable clinical and radiological evolution, improvement of abdominal pain until its disappearance, as well as disappearance of intermenstrual bleeding and bad odor of vaginal▁exudate.
Three months after the start of directed antibiotic treatment, a control abdominal CT scan was performed, in which a significant improvement was described as compared to the previous one, with an increase in the size of the uterus and inflammatory lesions persisting.
Abdominal c/c CT (after three months of treatment): significant improvement compared to the previous one, persisting an increase in uterine size and inflammatory lesions.
Currently the patient has completed six months of amoxicillin treatment, being asymptomatic and pending a new abdominal CT control, to decide the duration of antibiotic therapy.
Final diagnosis Pelvic necrosis in a patient with IUD.
