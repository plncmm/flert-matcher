Anamnesis A 48-year-old male, with no history of interest, who came to the emergency department for abdominal pain, fever, difficulty in deposition and a 2-week history of voiding.
Features Abdomen: blando, depressible, painful to palpation in the right iliac fossa - hypogastrium.
Rectal tract: prostate slightly increased in size with normal consistency, slightly painful to palpation.
▁Complementary tests • Abdominal X-ray: punctiform nodular metal density signs which, due to their distribution, suggest diverticula with barium content, although they could also correspond to remains of the methralla or perdigones.
• Biochemistry: C-reactive protein 24.5 mg/dl, creatinine 1.55 mg/dl, normal rest.
Urine output: microhematuria.
Blood count: no abnormalities.
Diagnosis Acute prostatitis.
Treatment Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours for 21 days.
Four days later, the patient was readmitted due to persistent clinical symptoms, associated with right glue pain radiating to the thigh, functional limitation of the ipsilateral hip and pollakiuria.
Blood and urine analysis remained unchanged, with negative urine culture and blood culture.
An abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed, finding an abscess of the right iliac psoas, which is treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy, as well as percutaneous drainage of the collection.
Multiresistant Enterococcus faecium was isolated.
Despite being discharged with oral antibiotic therapy with three antibiotics adjusted to the antibiogram, she was readmitted twice again due to recurrence and persistence of fever.
A new percutaneous puncture was attempted without obtaining fluid material.
The control CT scan one month after the last admission showed a hypodense area of 4.8 x 1.6 in the most medial portion of the right psoas, diverticulum with ipsilateral sigma signs and diverticulum at contact.
During the following months, the patient goes to the Emergency Department on numerous occasions due to symptoms compatible with urinary infection, microhematuria and pyuria, in addition to persistent abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, exacerbated with the broad spectrum antibiotic use.
Finally, the patient is evaluated by irritative voiding clinic in the Urology Department, performing an ultrasound of the urinary tract, which shows thickening of the mucosa, in addition to probable bladder cystoscopy, in which an extrinsic bladder floor edema was observed.
due to a nonspecific linear abscess, it was decided to perform an opaque enema, with evidence of bladder diverticula and a second CT scan, which showed a secondary thickening of the bladder wall as well as a
Finally, the patient underwent diagnostic flexible cystoscopy, showing a toothpick extracted with a foreign body clip.
After extraction, the patient was discharged with complete disappearance of the voiding symptoms.
