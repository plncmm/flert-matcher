A 44-year-old male patient with HIV who had been treated for one year with Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir and an undetectable viral load.
The patient presented with a two-month history of fever, erythematous, warm and painful nodules in the right forearm, as well as inflammation and tenosynovitis of the dorsum of the right hand.
Rest of the examination, normal.
▁Complementary tests X-ray, abdominal ultrasound: normal, ANA: positive homogeneous pattern, HLA-B51, Anti-ENA, ANCA, Anti-DNA antibodies, negative.
Analytical: RCT: 82mcg/L, normal rest.
Mantoux: positive.
Cutaneous biopsy culture: mycological, mycological and bacilloscopy, pathological cutaneous nodule: negative necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis (presence of acid-resistant bacilli).
The patient reports that he has a medical history at home, so, given the pathological findings, and this new data, this new information would be an infection due to M. tuberculosis with a probable resolution of 300mg q12hnia, Iso/24mg, Clar treatment
Mycosis fungoides is caused by erosionnum in the skin during the care of domestic aquariums.
The most common locations are the hands, followed by the forearm and lower limbs.
The initial lesion is a bullous▁papule, which can progress to erythematous nodules or plaques.
They can be solitary or follow a linear course along the lymphatic drainage line.
Sometimes, the infection can penetrate into underlying structures such as synovial pockets, stenosis, but lymph nodes are not usually affected.
Histologically, these are granulomas with tuberculoid appearance with or without central caseous necrosis.
Staining for acid-fast bacilli resistant bacilli is usually negative, requiring culture to identify the germ responsible.
