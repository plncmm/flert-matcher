Anamnesis A 66-year-old male with a history of allergy to acetyl salicylic acid, ex-smoker (pack-year index 20), hypertension and bronchial asthma treated with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.
Diagnosed duodenal ulcer with erradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori.
She began her oncological history in October 2017 when she was studied for dysphagia and intolerance to solids intake.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an ulcerated and friable mass at the antropyloric junction from which biopsies were taken.
The anatomopathological result was diffuse type gastric adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and presence of expression of MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2, HER-2 positive.
The extension study showed three hepatic lesions, the largest of 11 mm, and bone lesions compatible with metastases in addition to signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis, resulting as stage IV at diagnosis.
First line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, raltitrexed and trastuzumab was proposed every 21 days.
Twenty-four hours after receiving the first cycle, the patient developed grade 3 emetic symptoms with oral intolerance that did not respond to ondansetron and metoclopramide, which was the reason why he came to the emergency department.
Admission was cured due to suspected tumor obstruction with secondary aphagia and was treated with the Gastroenterology Service to propose placement of an antropylous endoprosthesis without incident, normally performing prosthesis.
Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the patient complained of sudden epigastric pain radiating to the right hypochondrium without nausea, vomiting or changes in bowel habits or characteristics of the stools at any time, intestinal obstruction.
Physical Performance status 1.
Vital signs: hypotensive (93/64 mm Hg), tachycardic, oxyhemoglobin saturation 95 %, affine.
Skin paleness and dry skin and mucous membranes
During cardiopulmonary auscultation, a murmur predominantly tricuspid grade II/VI and hypoventilation in the pulmonary bases stood out.
The abdomen showed signs of non-tension ascites, diffuse pain during palpation without signs of peritoneal irritation and without palpable organomegaly.
There were no edemas in the lower limbs.
Investigations Blood tests revealed elevated levels of total hydroxygenase (LDH 2847 IU/ dL), alkaline phosphatase 274 IU/ dL, gamma-aminolactate (GTH 23596), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GOTL)
The rest of the laboratory tests showed no relevant findings.
Urgent abdominal ultrasound was requested, which showed the three hepatic lesions previously described, which did not cause bile duct compromise, as well as diffuse increase in echogenicity in relation to liver disease.
He presented analytical criteria of acute liver failure and acute hepatitis, so a serological study of hepatotropic and autoimmunity viruses was requested, which were negative.
Diagnosis After ruling out pharmacological, viral, autoimmune, portal vascular or biliary stasis, a diagnosis of suspected hepatic veno-occlusive disease secondary to oxaliplatin was made.
Treatment Corticosteroid treatment was initiated with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg, in addition to support measures with serum therapy, diuretics and first step analgesia.
The patient received conservative treatment, and the patient reported symptomatic improvement, with good pain control.
However, analytically we observed a progressive increase of bilirubin without obstructive cause, reactive to the previous hepatotoxic picture, as well as acute renal failure. Renal ultrasound ruled out the presence of an obstructive cause of serum albumin pigment in the third space.
The patient subsequently presented an increase in ascites, with a large abdominal disk, pain and sensation of dyspnea. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed (whose cytology was positive for adenocarcinoma cells) and a liquid discharge closs of 8.500.
To confirm the diagnosis of suspected venoreal syndrome, a liver biopsy was proposed, but the patient began with fever without clear clinical focus.
A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with meropenem was initiated, subsequently de-escalated to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and contact isolation was prescribed after growth in a hemocultive of ESBL-producing E. coli.
Performing liver biopsy and continuing active oncological treatment are due to deterioration of performance status. The patient is referred to Palliative Care Unit for supportive treatment.
