Anamnesis This is a 55-year-old woman diagnosed 5 months before admission to Neurology of intestinal mucinous adenocarcinoma of the endocervix with signet ring cells, stage T2bN2M0.
In the extension study, lung and bone metastases and peritoneal dissemination were ruled out.
She underwent surgery by pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, leaving an unresectable rest attached to the left external iliac vein.
Subsequently, she received radiotherapy treatment of 46 Gy, concomitant chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin and subsequent implantation of endocytic brachytherapy.
Twenty days after brachytherapy was implanted, the patient came to the emergency room for severe frontal-occipital pulsatile headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
The pain was presented in a progressive way and manifested up to an intensity of 8/10.
He woke up early in the morning and increased with the Valsalva maneuver.
The patient was being treated with a descending dexamethasone regimen since radiotherapy, levofloxacin 500 mg per day for a hemorrhagic cyst secondary to treatment, tapentado 150 mg per day, diazepam 5 mg every 24 hours and night.
Physical examination showed vital signs within normal limits.
Afebril.
General condition: regular general condition, patient affected by pain.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal.
There were no data of active infection.
Neurological alteration: good level of consciousness.
Stiff neck was not observed (negative King and Brudzinski maneuvers).
The pupils were isochoric and normoreactive.
The examination of the cranial nerves was normal.
The strength, coordination and sensitivity in the extremities were normal.
Osteotendinous and cutaneous-plantar reflexes were normal.
The eye fundus was normal.
▁Complementary tests • Emergency computed tomography (CT): there were no data of intracranial hemorrhage or metastatic lesions, or ventricular dilatation.
• Blood analysis: microcytic iron deficiency anemia.
Mild hypercholesterolaemia, mild hypoalbuminaemia.
Normal renal, hepatic function and ionogram, including phosphate and magnesium.
Normal thyroid function.
• Tumor markers: Ag-Ac Ca125 161.5 IU/ml, elevated compared to the last control (84.6 IU/ml).
• Serology for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster: positive for IgG.
Serology of Lyme disease: negative.
• Lumbar puncture (LP) (Emergency Department): cerebrospinal fluid outflow pressure (CSF): 40 cm H2O.
Leukocytes within normal limits (5/mm3).
Glucose and protein are normal.
• Second PL (6th day): CSF pressure 39 cm H2O.
• Third PL (18th day): CSF pressure 28 cm H2O.
• CSF analysis: leukocytes 5/mm3.
Normal rectum.
• CSF cultures: negative.
VDRL serology and Lyme disease were negative.
• CSF cytology (3): negative for cells.
• Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a small focus of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration at the left thalamus, of nonspecific character.
• Spinal cord MRI: sacral bone changes related to hypogastric radiotherapy, which did not involve spinal cord involvement.
The medullary cord and the roots of the horsetail were normal in morphology and signal intensity and showed no enhancement after intravenous contrast administration.
• Cerebral MRA: no arteriovenous malformations were detected.
• Toco-abdominal CT: no new metastatic involvement was observed.
After worsening of headache and the onset of hearing loss and facial paresis, the following tests were performed: • Blood analysis: no new findings.
Ag-Ac Ca125 189.1 IU/l.
• Fourth PL: CSF pressure 33 cm H2O.
High protein binding, Wart 76 mg/dl) and hypoglycorrhachia (32 mg/dl).
• CSF cytology: negative.
• medullary MRI: linear enhancement in the anterior margin of the medullary cone and in the roots of the horsetail after administration of gadolinium, compatible with meningeal tumor dissemination.
Lumbar spinal magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast (gadolinium): anterior linear enhancement at the level of the medullary cone and horsetail compatible with meningeal carcinomatosis.
Diagnosis of meningitis secondary to uterine adenocarcinoma.
Treatment Initially, the patient was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension of possible pharmacological origin (corticosteroids and quinolone), so she received 250mg of acetazolamide every 8 hours, analgesia and opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
The descending pattern of corticosteroids was continued and antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin was withdrawn.
After 3 weeks of treatment, intracranial pressure and pain decreased, but the patient progressively developed facial paresis, hearing loss and decreased visual acuity.
Blood, CSF and analytical tests were repeated, as well as a new bone marrow MRI, which were compatible with meningeal carcinomatosis.
CSF cytology for leukocytes was again negative.
After diagnosis, the patient received treatment with holocraneal and lumbosacra radiotherapy, but the response was not good and the patient died 20 days later.
