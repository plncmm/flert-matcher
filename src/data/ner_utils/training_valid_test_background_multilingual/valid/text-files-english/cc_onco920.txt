Anamnesis Male 73 years, independent for basic activities of daily living.
He had been an ex-smoker for 22 years and had no other toxic habits.
The medical history of interest included longstanding arterial hypertension, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with acenocorol, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with home therapy.
In usual treatment with antihypertensives, pantoprazole and aerosol therapy.
It was diagnosed in October 2014 of adenocarcinoma of the distal third of the esophagus (T3Nx, M0 c-erb2 negative), being presented in the oncological committee to assess resectability, which is dismissed due to total surgical comorbidity.
For this reason, it was finally decided to treat with chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy concomitantly.
The patient received weekly paclitaxel + platinum treatment and radiotherapy (50Gy) from February to April 2015.
The objective was to stabilize the disease in both CT and gastroscopy, so it was decided to follow up the patient in consultation.
She was admitted in September 2016 due to a high-grade fever syndrome accompanied by chills and thiritens without apparent source.
During this procedure, a new appearance of a hypodense splenic lesion is detected by imaging tests (CT), which could be related to metastatic lesion.
These findings are considered to be a disease and chemotherapy regimen is initiated FOLFIRI with intent-to-treat progression (recib up to three cycles).
In October 2016, the patient was readmitted due to feverish peak without identifying any cause.
A study was performed with marked leukocytes without detecting any lesion with avidity by the tracer, so it was ruled out at this moment infectious focus.
Abdominal CT was repeated for reassessment, which showed an increase in size of the splenic lesion compared to previous studies (from 22 mm to 35 mm).
The patient was re-admitted in October 2016, due to a new fever of up to 38.5 oC, with poor closure of the surgical wound after implantation of reservoir (port to cath) although without signs of overinfection.
Streptococcus intermedius was isolated in hemocultives, so antibiotic treatment was established. Reservory was removed and placed on the contralateral side without incidents.
In December 2016, the patient was readmitted with septic shock, requiring treatment with noradrenaline for a new high-grade fever syndrome and 24 hours of evolution, accompanied by chills and tiritone.
There is no evidence of focus: the patient does not refer respiratory symptoms, alteration of gastrointestinal habits, voiding symptoms or any kind of symptoms.
Physical examination upon arrival at the emergency room, febrile patient (38.7 oC), with 110 mm Hg pressures.
The patient maintains good diuresis and acceptable saturation with nose clips at 3L.
The patient is conscious, oriented and cooperative.
With affectation of the general state.
Good perfusion and hydration.
During cardiorespiratory auscultation, arrhythmic tone and hypoventilation on the left base are observed.
Excessive, blando, depressible abdomen without pain, without masses or enlargement, no signs of peritonitis and hydroaerial noise are present.
Reservory region without signs of overinfection or pain during palpation.
▁Complementary laboratory tests at admission showed mild leukocytosis (10.3 x 10.9/l) with high levels of procalcitonin (22.84 ng/ml) and CRP (114 mg/l).
In addition, an admission plate was made, in which no clear images of condensation or effusion were evidenced.
Echocardiography is performed on the floor, but it is negative for endocarditis. Abdominal CT shows three lesions in the periphery, but not large, with fluid density distributed from the hilium to moderate pleural effusion, and pleural effusion can be ruled out.
Along these findings, an abdominal ultrasound study was performed, reporting two heterogeneous visible areas (hypoechogenic zone) up to 45 x 39 mm in diameter, which impress splenic abscesses
Differential hemocultives (reservory and peripheral route) were extracted. Staphylococcus epidermis grew in these patients with a non-significant differential growth time.
pleural abscess associated with infection in the tests, probably resulting in the patient's clinical features, was diagnosed with multisensitive Streptococcus intermedius bacteremia, causing fever, as well as the three spla
Treatment Initially, given the picture of septic shock and high elevation of acute phase reactants, the patient received empirical antibiotic coverage with cefepime, de-escalating ceftriaxone after isolation in hemodermoccultives of S.
After clinical stabilization, the placement of Pleur-and-effect culture was performed, as well as drainage by guided aspiration guided by two of the three intermed cultures, which were also positive for Stronics (persistence ultrasound).
Given the important affectation of the patient's general condition and the important infectious picture, it was decided to▁pause chemotherapy treatment for the moment.
The patients evolution was very good, with disappearance of fever and improvement of general condition.
In addition, a favorable radiological evolution of splenic abscesses was observed, with a significant reduction in size in response to antibiotic treatment.
The patient was discharged with the same antimicrobial treatment.
During follow-up in outpatient clinics after four weeks, persistent deterioration of the general condition was observed. Control CT showed persistence of splenic lesions that led us to assume a metastatic origin with overinfection of these lesions.
A reassessment CT was requested, showing progression of an oncological disease with an increase in the size of a distal esophageal tumor extending to the gastric junction. Epiploic nodules suggesting nodular implants were also observed.
Due to these findings and poor general condition of the patient, it was decided to discontinue chemotherapy and refer the patient to the Continuing Care Unit for follow-up.
