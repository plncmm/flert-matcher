An 11-year-old boy presented with rhinoconjunctivitis per capita and episodic asthma, without underlying treatment.
She consulted for two recent episodes of anaphylaxis (urticaria and bronchospasm) while exercising, preceded by intake of fried potatoes on one occasion, and chicken hamburger.
After soup with soybean oil, she suffered another anaphylaxis without association with physical exercise.
Positive skin tests: grasses, olives, male, mites and soya.
It was negative, but positive in prick-prick.
LTP, profilin, polcalcin and bead were negative.
Specific IgE: leguminous negative, except peanut (0.39 kU/L).
rPru p3, rBet v1, rAra h1/h2/h3 and rTri a19 negative.
SDS-PAGE Blotting (patient-extracted raw peanut): protein binding of 16, 18, 23, 30, 45 kDa.
They are identified as a molecular mass of peanuts with molecular mass 16-18 kDa: Ara h2 (Conglutinin), Ara h8 (PR-10), Ara h10/h14/heras
Oleosins in SDS-PAGE assays usually migrate as monomers (bands 16-18 kDa) or aggregates (larger bands).
In foods involved in patient reactions, the possible common allergenic source is soy oil, and could be its oleosin, the protein responsible for anaphylaxis.
