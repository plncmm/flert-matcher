A 46-year-old woman with no medical history was seen in the clinic for a five-month febrile syndrome.
Fever was daily, predominantly evening and accompanied by night sweats.
No other symptoms were associated.
The examination showed only laterocervical, supraclavicular, mobile lymph nodes with soft consistency.
In the initial tests only stood out microcytic iron deficiency anemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dL, MCV of 72.7 fL, ferritin of 97 ng/mL), and elevated CRP (16.5 mg/dL).
The chest X-ray was normal.
In cases of long-term monosymptomatic fever, infectious causes such as tuberculosis, subacute endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscesses and leishmania should be considered.
Any autoimmune disease may present with fever, being sarcoidosis and polymyalgia the most frequently occurring.
Lymphoma, hepatocarcinoma and clear cell cancer are the most common malignancies presenting with fever.
The extended study focused on fever and microcytic anemia included bacilloscopy, serology (HCV, HBV, HIV), ac.
anti-tranglutaminase, abdominal ultrasound, transthoracic echocardiogram, gastroscopy and gastrointestinal endoscopy were normal or negative.
The proteinogram showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.
To complete the study of fever of unknown origin, F18-FDG PET-CT showed diffuse metabolic hyperactivity in the bone marrow and at the left supraclavicular level.
Based on these findings, a bone marrow biopsy with immunophenotype was requested, and microbiological studies for leishmania and tuberculosis were negative.
A left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was performed, which reported sclerosing lymphadenitis with polyclonal vascular proliferation compatible with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease.
PCR for HIV and VHH-8 on the surgical specimen was negative.
IL-6 was 650.
Tocelizumab (ac.
IL-6 receptor blocker), with clinical improvement, regression of lymph nodes and decrease of IL-6 (fundamental in the pathogenesis of this disease).
