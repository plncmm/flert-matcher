Anamnesis A 57-year-old previously healthy male presented to the emergency department with a painful lesion on the nasal dorsum of five days duration.
Trauma or stinging in the area
The initial lesion was a pink, inflammatory and painful plaque that subsequently developed small pustules, some of them with whitish exudation.
He also reported bilateral frontotemporal headache.
Man's good general condition without fever at all times.
Physical examination revealed good general condition,▁malaise and normal blood pressure.
Examination of the lesion showed an erythematous edematous plaque with a non-contrast-enhanced appearance occupying the nasal dorsum extensively, and over it multiple monomorphic pustules measuring 1 mm with irregular surface area of 10 mm.
No similar lesions were found in the other faces and locoregional lymphadenopathies were not present.
▁Complementary blood tests showed complete blood count, biochemistry, coagulation and acute phase reactants within normal limits and negative antinuclear antibodies.
Bacterial culture and bacilloscopy of a skin biopsy were negative.
Histopathological examination showed a mixed interstitial dermal inflammatory infiltrate diffuse follicular (A) with massive exocytosis of the follicular epithelium (C) and extension to the subcutaneous cellular tissue, necrosis in a mass of▁keratinocytes and fibrinoid vasculitis.
▁Cytological changes typical of herpes virus were observed in the▁keratinocytes of the follicular epithelium (B, D) extending to the sebaceous glands (B).
The cytoparticle changes included intranuclear inclusions, multinucleated▁keratinocytes, ground glass cytoplasm and necrotic remnants of▁keratinocytes.
Finally, PCR for herpes virus was positive for Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV).
She also had positive blood serology for VZV compatible with ongoing infection and negative for ESR, HIV, hepatotropic virus and loos.
Diagnosis Fol, Herpestic necrotizing by VZV.
Treatment Initially, empirical treatment with topical mupirocin was performed together with intravenous ceftriaxone and cefazolin, with a slight decrease in inflammation.
Once the definitive diagnosis was established, treatment with oral pastevir 800 mg 5 times a day was initiated at 4 hour intervals, omitting the nocturnal dose for 7 days.
The patients evolution was excellent, with complete resolution of the cutaneous lesions after two weeks of follow-up.
However, the patient complained of more or less persistent headache, sometimes pulsatile, with no warning signs and poor response to paracetamol and non-steroid medications.
He is currently being followed up by the Neurology service with the diagnosis of postherpetic cranial neuralgia.
She improved with the administration of amitriptyline 10-20 mg daily at night and eslicarbamacepine 200 mg daily in the morning.
In addition, a curious finding was that her adolescent daughter developed classic varicella one week after the diagnosis of herpetic phallus, probably due to paternal transmission.
