Anamnesis A 67-year-old man with no relevant family history, no known drug allergies, ex-smoker and drinker of 1-2 glasses of wine per day, hypertension, lumbar dyslipemia and intervention.
Since 2003, the patient was monitored in Urology due to a progressive increase in pro-specific antigen (PSA) levels and had up to eight negative biopsies.
He was finally diagnosed in November 2013 of combined grade prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason 6 (3 + 3) with two minimal foci in the left lobe and transition zone, cT1c stage.
We completed an extension study (computed tomography [CT] thoracic, abdominal and pelvic and bone scintigraphy) without data of metastatic disease.
Radioterápica was administered to 145 patients with prostate cancer for brachytherapy in May 2014 with insertion of 18 transperineal vector needles under ultrasound guidance and placement of 63 low Gy seeds.
Subsequent follow-ups every 6 months did not provide progression data, with a PSA maintained below 1 ng/dl.
Before the present admission, he had reviewed in January 2017, presenting PSA values of 0.14 ng/dl.
He came to the emergency room on May 2017 for progressive back pain of 2 months evolution.
The pain had mechanical characteristics, worsened with respiratory movements and trunk dorsiflexion, non-irradiated.
He did not report previous trauma, exertion or other trigger.
He had no pain at other levels.
She had no fever or infectious symptoms in the anamnesis by equipment.
She was assessed by Rehabilitation in outpatient clinics, and was waiting for the start of physical therapy at the time of admission.
Establishment plan for the EMEA
Eupneic.
Neurological findings were normal, with no focal findings.
The dorsolumbar region showed no signs of trauma or hematoma, with sequelae of arthrodesis scar.
» Palpation of painless dorsal and lumbar spine apophysis, as well as fixation of skeletal muscles.
» Rest of physical examination within normal limits.
▁Complementary tests The tests performed during their stay in the emergency room were as follows: » Blood analysis which highlighted: creatinine and normal dL SGOT 32,000 C-reactive protein (CRP) 12.3 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 924.
» Radiography of the spine: dorsal spondyloarthrosis with numerous osteophytes.
» Pulmonary thromboembolism protocol angiotomography: no data suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism.
Degenerative changes in the dorsal spine with hypertrophy and flattening of the bodies of the dorsal spinous apophysis and L1, as well as low interpinning edges related to arthrodesis.
Diagnosis A dorsalgia was diagnosed.
Treatment The patient was kept in observation beds and tried to control pain with first-step analgesics without improvement, so a fentanyl patch was started 12 mcg/h, although with inadequate control.
Finally, the patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for imaging studies (MRI), given the medical history and the complexity of pain control.
Magnetic resonance imaging at first reported metastatic lesions due to prostate carcinoma after finding almost complete involvement of the T4, T6, T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, with extension to the right vertebral body at T4-5, and T6 vertebral targets.
In addition, there was a mass of soft tissues bilaterally (2 cm) and prefixed with aorta and cava without walls.
With these results, an assessment was requested by the Medical Ontario pain management service.
absence of other clear signs of progression with data of absence of disease in the last revision, the X-ray service requested a reassessment of the images with suspicion at this time of probable infectious colitis.
Diagnostic biopsy and diagnostic studies were requested.
Bone scintigraphy showed no metastatic disease and chest, abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no evidence of primary tumor or metastatic disease, both of which were reported as possible spondylodyscitis.
PSA within the low limits of normal.
A core needle biopsy was performed at T4 level and a sample was sent to culture.
The microbiological study was positive for Streptococcus intermedius (which was also isolated in 1⁄4 of removed hemocultives) and with anatomopathological result compatible with osteomyelitis, without data of disease.
Antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated.
Despite the antibiotic treatment instituted, the clinical course was unfavorable, requiring progressive increase in analgesia, with a haemodynamically stable patient at all times, afflicted, without leukocytosis and with decreasing CRP.
After 2 weeks of treatment, it was decided to repeat the dorsal magnetic resonance to assess the evolution with findings of radiological worsening, discal destruction T5-T6 and appearance of phlegmon with small abscesses in the posterior epidural space contacting the spinal cord with a small effect
Currently the patient is still admitted and pending evolution and surgical evaluation.
