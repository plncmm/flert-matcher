A 70-year-old white male patient, agricultural worker, with no remarkable pathological history.
The patient presented with fever, vomiting and▁malaise, interpreted as bronchopneumonia, and was treated with antimicrobials.
Two weeks later, the patient complained of general▁malaise, weakness and dizziness.
It is reevaluated, detecting a second-degree atrioventricular block, so the heart rate with transient (MP) is regulated, and then the permanent generator is implanted.
The reported symptoms worsened and dyspnea appeared.
A transthoracic echocardiographic study (TTE) detected an intracardiac mass and was referred to our center.
Physical examination revealed a vesicular murmur decreased to the lung bases, with wheezing, and a diastolic murmur to the tip that impressed to change with changes in patient position.
The baseline electrocardiogram showed a pacemaker rhythm of 80 beats per minute, and the chest X-ray showed a small left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.
There was anemia and mild leukocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear cells.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed the tumor mass attached to the mitral anterior valve in its auricular face, prolapsed to the left ventricle (LV) in the diastolic transsystole of 20 mmHg, producing a gradient of left ventricular diastolic ejection.
Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary lesions and was prepared for emergency surgery.
In the operating room, left atrial septal defect (left ventricular septal defect) was closed with a longitudinal median approach, arterial and venous cannulation for extracorporeal circulation (ECC), right atriotomy, aortic clamping and anoxic arrest with isothermal blood cardioplegia
Thus, a brown-yellow oval tumor mass of approximately 8 cm in diameter was exposed, with an implant base that extended towards the mitral annulus involving its anterior leaflet integrity and causing loss of anterior leaflet.
The tumor was completely▁resected near the mitral leaflet and a standard 25 mm bi-disk mechanical prosthesis was implanted Sorin/Carbomedics Standard.
The procedure was completed in a conventional manner, without difficulties; using times of 87 minutes of aortic cross-clamping and 120 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass.
She was extubated 2 hours after arrival at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, placed in a conventional ward on the second day, and discharged on the sixth postoperative day.
At the three-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with sinus rhythm (MP without FEV) and TTE showed a left AI free of tumor masses, a normofunctioning mechanical prosthesis with a gradient of 58% 12 mmHg.
