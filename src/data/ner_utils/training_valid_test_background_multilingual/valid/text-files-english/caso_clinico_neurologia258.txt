62 year old anamnesis with gastroesophageal reflux, benign prostatic hypertrophy and low back pain as the only antecedents of interest in treatment with levosulate and etoricoxib "sometimes", which caused concern.
The reason is that he had presented, abruptly, an episode of decreased level of consciousness and loss of strength in the right hemibody with posterior fall to the ground and alteration of language emission, without other associated symptoms.
One day before he had made a transatlantic voyage on a 12-hour aircraft, where he had adopted abnormal sleeping postures.
Computed tomography (CT) showed indirect signs of acute ischemic stroke. Intravenous fibrinolysis was performed without initial clinical improvement.
Physical examination Temperature 36.3 oC, blood pressure 111/95 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, oxygen saturation 97%, BM test 137 mg/dl.
Good general condition, normohydrated, perfused and colored.
Cardiopulmonary arrest and abdomen were normal.
Petechiae preserved in the upper and lower limbs
No signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Neurological evaluation: vigil, Glasgow score 11/15 (O4 V16), global aphasia.
Cholesterols and normoreactive.
Conserved external ocular movements.
▁Right central facial paralysis.
▁Right hemianopsia.
Muscle balance was 0/5 on the right upper limb and 1/5 on the right lower limb.
Skin-plantar left flexor, right extensor.
▁Right phciobrachio-crural hypoesthesia.
NIHSS: 0-2-2- 0-2-4-0-4-0-1-3-0 = 20 points.
▁Complementary tests • Basic laboratory study: total cholesterol 221 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 150 mg/dl, triglycerides 163 mg/dl.
Biochemistry, thyroid asymmetry, coagulation, hormones and tumor markers were normal.
• Microbiology: negative serology for hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and positive for syphilis (IgG, RPR, TPPA).
• Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index, without pulmonary infiltrates or costophrenic sinus clamping.
• Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, occasional atrial extrasystoles, without acute changes in repolarization.
• Holter ECG: sinus rhythm with isolated low density VES and occasional VES.
• Transthoracic echocardiography: no significant changes.
• Urgent transcranial Doppler (during intravenous fibrinolysis): occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery with proximal flows decreased compared to the contralateral.
ACA artery velocities and left posterior cerebral artery were within normal limits.
• Supraaortic trunk duplex (SAT): shock wave in ICA-I.
ACI-I dissection with distal occlusion.
Rest without significant changes.
• Cranial CT: lenticular nucleus density, loss of cortico-subcortical differentiation of the insula of the left posteromedial portion of the ipsilateral frontal and temporal pole hyperdense.
• Postmortem cranial CT scan of the cranial nerve: hyperdensity of the ACIrnosa, supraclinoid, and left M1.
Hypodensity of the insular ribet, lenticular nucleus, left frontal and temporal operculum and partial left caudal nucleus (ASPECTS 5-6).
Grade 1 edema.
There are no signs of bleeding.
Cerebral computerized tomography of post-ischemic intravenous dyslysis showed hypodensity of the insular ribet, lenticular nucleus, cauda nucleus and left frontal and temporal operculum cerebral artery, compatible with cerebral infarction.
• Cerebral CT angiography and SAT: acute infarction of the left middle cerebral artery (ASPECTS 5-6), without evidence of mismatch, secondary to occlusion of the carotid bifurcation of the intracranial ICA possibly due to distal carotid dissection MCA and cerebral artery.
CT angiography of the supra-aortic trunk and polygon of the trunk.
Left carotid CT angiography showed absence of filling of the cervical internal carotid artery 20 mm from its origin in the bifurcation.
CT angiography of the polygonocosis is an occlusion in which the bifurcation of the intracranial internal carotid artery is observed, originating in the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery.
Diagnosis Acute cerebral infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery of unusual origin.
Left internal carotid artery dissection.
Positive syphilis serology.
Treatment and evolution During admission, the patient remained clinically and hemodynamically stable.
The presence of extensive infarction with signs of grade 1 edema was established with intravenous mannitol.
Given the positive result for syphilis in the blood, and after ruling out lumbar puncture due to the risk of complications in this patient, consultation with the cardidymis was performed to assess a probable high-dose antibiotic treatment in only one patient week.
Upon discharge, aphasia and right hemiparesis persisted, with an NIHSS score of 18 points and 5 points on the modified Rankin scale.
The patient was referred to a rehabilitation center.
