A 7-month-old female patient with mild unilateral ptosis and dacryorrhagia with▁crying and lacrimal sac expression since she was fifteen days old.
He was born in Spain and his mother with a history of Eastern Europe.
The exploration revealed a pseudomembrane upper subtarsal and left preauricular adenopathy, without secretion or hyperemia, with superficial pannus in the uppermost area.
The lacrimal pathway was washed and the conjunctival▁exudate culture was negative.
In the initial study, a magnetic resonance imaging and an otorhinolaryngological examination were performed to rule out paranasal sinuses and lacrimal drainage system pathology.
Tobramycin and dexamethasone were administered topically.
One month later, partial resolution of the ptosis and total resolution of the pseudomelanoma were observed.
Two months later subtarsal follicles persisted in different stages, so Chlamydia trachomatis was identified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) which was positive.
Topical treatment was initiated with topical and anticonvulsant medication (50 mgrs/kg/day in 4 doses) for 14 days.
At the end of the treatment, the clinical findings had been practically identical.
A PCR study of conjunctival▁exudate and urine of individuals living in the family nucleus was performed.
The only positive test was the urine of the mother, 29 weeks pregnant.
However, maternal cervix culture was negative for Chlamydia trachomatis.
Systemic treatment was applied to parents with and without fever (500 mg/6 h) for 7 days.
The eradication of the germ was confirmed by PCR of the conjunctival▁exudate of the patient and maternal urine.
