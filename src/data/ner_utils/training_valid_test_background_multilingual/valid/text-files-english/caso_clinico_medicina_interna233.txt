A 66-year-old male with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy.
He was admitted in 2006 with the community diagnosis of internal‚ñÅcalculi and septic shock caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and again in 2007 with community acquired pneumonia caused by pneumonia caused by pneumonia caused by pneumonia.
Emergency department complaining of pain and decreased visual acuity in the right eye and fever.
The fever is related to a flu picture, it is diagnosed of uveitis and it is decided to discharge.
Later, ocular discomfort worsens, fever increases and headache associated with non-standard analgesia is associated.
She came 48 hours later to the Emergency Department and was diagnosed with endophthalmitis in the affected eye.
Blood analysis showed: GOT 56UI/l, GPT 232 IU/l and GGT 160 IU/l.
The chest X-ray was normal.
Lumbar puncture was performed: 1555 cells/microL (82% neutrophils) with glucose consumption compatible with acute bacterial meningitis.
Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone, ampicillin and Vancomycin.
Suspected septic emboli, an echocardiogram (normal) and an abdominal ultrasound (hypoechoic lesion 12 mm compatible with abscess) were performed.
Multisensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from CSF, blood and urine cultures.
Despite antibiotic adjustment according to the antibiogram, the clinical course is poor and after a few days, the patient requires admission to the ICU.
Multiple brain, lung and liver abscesses were demonstrated by imaging techniques.
It requires consolidation of the right eye with a new growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae in ocular samples.
Because of the possibility of a high virulence strain, a sample is sent to the reference laboratory of Microbiology, Klebsiella pneumoniae serotype K1.
Finally, after several adjustments of the antibiotic therapy, the evolution is satisfactory and the patient is discharged home after three months of admission.
Serotype K1 is a highly virulent pathogen that typically acantones in the liver and often results in catastrophic septic complications in the eye and central nervous system.
Although it is relatively common in Asia (especially in diabetic patients), it is an exceptional germ in Europe, of which there are very few cases described in Spain.
