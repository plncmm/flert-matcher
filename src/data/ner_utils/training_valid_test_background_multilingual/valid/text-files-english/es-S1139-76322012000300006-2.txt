A 13-year-old female patient with no relevant personal history presented with bilateral vestibular edema of three days duration.
In the subsequent directed anamnesis, he reported accompanying headache with mild odynophagia, without associated fever.
The physical examination revealed bilateral pupillary oedema without another ocular disorder. There were no oedemas, and hypertrophy in other locations was observed in 2/4 without▁exudates.
In the following days, the patient returned to the clinic three times due to persistent fever and increased edema, without other symptoms.
Urine dipstick was performed on several occasions without detecting proteinuria and culture of pharyngeal▁exudate which was negative.
ALT increased and negativity of tests performed so far, blood count, blood chemistry, liver profile and urine sediment were requested with normal results except leukocytosis (18 460/μL) with▁lymphocytic predominance ( 184 UIPT/μL).
Ten days after the onset of the clinical picture, edematous plaque resolved without evidence of fever, lymphadenopathy or hepatomegaly.
Analytical control was performed at three weeks after a complete blood count showed no abnormalities and a decrease in transaminase levels to normal (GOT 22 IU/l, GPT 16 IU/l).
The suspicion of mononucleic syndrome requires serology of EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), obtaining IgM against EBV which allows diagnostic confirmation.
