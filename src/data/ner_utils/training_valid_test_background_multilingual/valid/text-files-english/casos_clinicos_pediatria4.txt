We report the case of a 4-year-old patient, with no personal history of interest, who consulted in the emergency department for a fever of 72 hours of evolution (up to 39.5°C) symptoms and diffuse intermittent abdominal pain.
As a family history, the father affected by acute▁lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) under chemotherapy treatment stands out.
Vital signs and physical examination upon arrival: Temperature 37°C, heart rate (HR) 155 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 37 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 90/40 mmHg, inspired oxygen saturation 89%.
General condition affection, cutaneous dryness, coldness and elongated capillary▁refill.
Petechial rash on neck, back and lower limbs
Subcostal traction and hypoventilation and crackles in the left hemithorax.
Rhythmic tones without murmurs.
pharyngeal hyperaemia.
The abdomen was blushing, depressible, with no masses or enlargements.
Lethargy and brachypsychic, with no data on neurological focus or neck stiffness.
The patient had a febrile syndrome of 72 hours of evolution, accompanied by tachycardia and tachypnea at the time of evaluation, thus meeting diagnostic criteria for sepsis.
intravenous antibiotics were prescribed.
It was decided to admit the patient to the PICU.
Blood tests showed white blood cells 2.970/mm3, lymphocytes 240/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.6 g/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP) 92.6 mg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) 34
Venous gas: pH 7.26, 53 mmHg, HCO3 21.8 mmol/L, base excess (EB) -5 mEq/L, lactic acid 4.8 mmol/L.
Ionogram, renal and hepatic function and coagulation were normal.
After admission to the PICU, clinical worsening persists, fulfilling the criteria of established septic shock, with sustained hypotension despite volume expansion (total fluids 80 ml/kg).
Orotracheal intubation was performed with connection to invasive mechanical ventilation, central venous access was channeled and inotropic support with dopamine and dobutamine was initiated.
A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the left lung field and right upper lobe, and an echocardiogram showed correct biventricular function, with no data of structural heart disease.
A few hours after admission, the Microbiology Service reported growth of Gram positive▁cocci Streptococcus morphology in the hemocultive, as well as positive pharyngeal smears for Streptococcus pyogenes.
On physical examination, a progression of the rash at the▁thorax level that acquires scarlatiniform characteristics is highlighted.
Hemodynamic lability is observed in the first hours of admission with significant difference in systolic-diastolic blood pressure that requires initiation of inotropic support with noradrenaline and greater oxygen requirements (FiO2 0.4 to 0.6) to maintain normal.
Times after achieving clinical stability and sepsis control, highlights the appearance of right crepitants, hepatomegaly and central venous pressures (CVP) > 12 cm H2O.
A new radiological control was requested.
A lung ultrasound was performed with data of pulmonary edema (increased B-lines), left pleural effusion (30 mm) and presence of ipsilateral consolidation.
Fluid restriction was performed and furemide was forced, with PVC showing negative fluid balance and H2O values between 5-10 cm.
Nevertheless, at 36 hours of admission, high FiO2 requirements persist, with PEEP between 8-10 cmH2O, so we decided to perform 4 heme removal without obtaining a pleural drainage tube.
After the introduction of these measures, respiratory and hemodynamic improvement was initially observed.
On the fourth day of admission, however, the patient presented progressive worsening in the respiratory level, with difficulty in performing auscultation, with a final rate of abnormal auscultation and positive pressure (IO) of 25 cmH2O, despite optimization of the parameters.
Hemodynamics was maintained with noradrenaline and low doses.
Control analysis: leukocytes 6,200/mm3, Hb 11.8 g/dl, hematocrit 36%, platelets 97,000/mm3.
Elevation of CRP and PCT.
Worsening of the bilateral pulmonary parenchyma in radiological control.
The hypoxemia presented by the patient was monitored by echocardiography, with no data of cardiac dysfunction, and signs of stable Hb and hematocrit levels.
In addition, a new lung ultrasound examination showed bilateral patchy pattern.
The diagnosis of ARDS changes the ventilation strategy with open lung ventilation strategy with high PEEP (step 15 cmH20), as well as low recovery volume, applying permissive hypercapnia, so we decided to place the patient in a prone position.
After the appearance of the exanthema iscarlatiniform, which subsequently establishes oral and genital mucosa, the possibility that the patient will present a streptococcal SST was raised.
The appearance of complications associated with the entity was carefully monitored.
Finally, on the fourth day of admission, after the establishment of ARDS and the appearance of thrombopenia, he met diagnostic criteria for SST of the streptococci.
Streptococcus pyogenes is highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics; however, the use of penicillin monotherapy in cases of SST is associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Clindamycin was associated with previous treatment with IV ceftriaxone.
Levels of immunoglobulin G (200 mg/dl; normal range 700-1,700 mg/dl) were requested and after finding low levels of it, treatment with IV immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was started.
Given the state of immunosuppression of the father of the patient, prophylaxis with oral penicillin (250 mg/6 hours for two days) was indicated.
The patient had a favorable clinical and analytical evolution.
Antibiotic therapy was maintained with ceftriaxone and clindamycin IV for 14 days, with negative control cultures.
From the respiratory point of view, the patient was subsequently extubated electively for non-invasive ventilation after 15 days of invasive mechanical ventilation, receiving high-flow▁inpatient support and definitive withdrawal at 19 days
The immunity study was performed with results within normal limits.
Currently, she is asymptomatic and has not presented new infectious processes that could support hospitalization.
