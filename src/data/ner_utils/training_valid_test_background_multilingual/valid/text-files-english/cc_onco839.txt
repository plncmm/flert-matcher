He had a moderate effort.
No infectious symptoms are currently present.
Establishment plan
She was hemodynamically stable and afflicted.
Jaundice in skin, mucous membranes
Cardiac arrest: rhythmic tones, without audible murmurs.
Pulmonary consolidation: hypoventilation.
Abdomen: verytended, troublesome in disorientation, large hepatomegaly up to 15 cm below the right costal margin.
Lower extremities: no edema.
▁Complementary tests Analytical prior to the start of treatment: Hb9 mEq 7.8 g/dl, leukocytes 36,800 mmc, platelets 547,000 mmc, creatinine 0.71 mg/dl, total bilirubin 127 mg/dl
In previous days, the figure of acid was 10.4 mg/dl.
Neuroendocrine tumor markers showed specific neuronal enolase 309.3 ng/ml and▁chromogranin A 914.4 ng/ml.
Diagnosis with a diagnosis of NECG3 (ki-67: 90 %) of heart disease, with multisystem involvement, the patient enters the On Medical and Advanced Disease (see section 1, 80 mg chemotherapy treatment), stage IV disease
A transfusion of 2 concentrates was also performed.
The next day, the patient presented significant clinical deterioration, with dyspnea at rest and oxygen saturation below 90%, requiring conservative treatment with a reservoir.
Blood tests were performed, highlighting: acid 5,4l mg/dl, creatinine 1,02 mg/dl, phosphorus 4,1 mg/dl, total cholesterol 577 mg/dl, LDL 522 mg/dl, calcium 125 mEq/dl.
Arterial gas presents pH 7.31, pCO2 25 mm Hg, pO2 56 mm Hg, bicarbonate 12.6 mmol/l, base excess 12.1 mmol/l and oxygen saturation 86 % (with VMK).
Treatment was initiated with allopurinol 100 mg/8h orally, rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg/day intravenously in a single dose, furosemide 20 mg/8h intravenously, and fluconazole was initiated with intensive gastro-esophageal isolation.
In analytical control and venous pH monitoring mmol/dl bases: mercury bicarbonate 14.7, creatinine 1.61 mg/dl, calcium 8.2 mg/dl, sodium 132 mEq/l, potassium 69.1 mEq/l, phosphorus 8.128 mg/dl
The progressive clinical deterioration was observed in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure and tumor lysis syndrome with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
Treatment Continued support in the ICU, requiring continuous non-invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive fluid replacement therapy, ICU as well as empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tabalazole antifungal therapy, maintaining antifungal treatment with fluconazole.
The presence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on portable chest X-ray is highlighted, establishing the differential diagnosis between acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhage and infectious complication.
The patients evolution was favorable, with ventilatory support, creatinine levels, calcium and potassium in the normal range.
After 8 days in the ICU, the patient was admitted again to the medical ward.
A new control chest X-ray was performed with great improvement compared to the previous one.
The patient presented progressive recovery of the general condition so it was decided to be discharged home in subsequent days.
