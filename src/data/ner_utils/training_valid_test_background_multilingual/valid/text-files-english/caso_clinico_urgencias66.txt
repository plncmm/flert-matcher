A 14-year-old patient with no relevant past medical history presented to the emergency department with headache, drowsiness, fever, clumsiness on gait and stiffness of the neck of 48 hours of evolution.
She reported fever, cough, and diarrhea in the last week.
Physical examination showed a temperature of 38°C, with involvement of the general condition, rest of the constants, cardiopulmonary auscultation and normal abdominal examination.
The neurological examination showed a Glasgow 14, dysarthria, somnolence, neck stiffness in movement 15, positive Brudzinski, left lateral gaze nystagmus, lower proximal muscle strength in lower extremities 3/5
Neurological examination was unremarkable.
Analytically, the biochemical, hemogram and hemostasis were normal, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.83 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.2 ng/mL.
The cranial computed tomography (CT) was normal and the lumbar puncture with glucose 52 mg/dl, 230 leukocytes with 85% mononuclear cells and proteins 70 mg/dl.
Given the findings compatible with acute encephalopathy and paresis in the lower limbs, treatment with cefoxime, vancomycin and a cure is initiated for admission to the intensive care unit, where the study is completed.
An electroencephalogram showed bilateral posterior slow focality with right predominance over preserved background activity.
Electromyography does not rule out polyarterioneuritis or motor neuron involvement.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord shows diffuse patchy, poorly defined medullary involvement, compatible with an inflammatory process of acute encephalomyelitis type.
In the brain there is patchy alteration in the brainstem and peduncle cerebellar, mesencephalophalum and▁ganglia of the right base of predominance, compatible with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
Serologies for Brucella, Lues, mycoplasma, measles, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus and Lyme negative findings are maintained, and treatment with gammaglobulins and intravenous corticosteroids is initiated at high doses.
After confirming the negative culture results and PCR for herpes virus, antimicrobial treatment is withdrawn.
The patient showed slow but progressive clinical improvement, persistent paresis in the lower limbs, tendency to somnolence and dysarthria.
With the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, she was referred to the pediatric service, where she evolved favorably and was discharged with home treatment, leading to rehabilitation to complete treatment.
