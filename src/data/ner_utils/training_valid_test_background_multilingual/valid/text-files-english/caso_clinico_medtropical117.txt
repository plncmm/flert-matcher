Personal history A 35-year-old black male from Nigeria living in Spain for four months.
He only reported having a crypticized cyst, but not other pathological antecedents of interest.
Current illness referred to a diffuse abdominal pain of one week duration and intensity, with occasional bilious nausea and vomiting, feverish sensation not thermometrated, with profuse sweating episodes.
In the last 24 hours, the patient had severe asthenia and bedridden, which is why he came to the hospital.
Physical examination revealed an axillary temperature of 38oC, blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, and basal arterial oxygen saturation of 99%.
She had a poor general condition, but she was advised and was a collaborator.
He was normonourished and well hydrated.
The oral cavity was normal and adenopathies were not observed.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal.
The abdomen was distended and tender for fixation in the right hypochondrium, with muscle defense and signs of peritonitis, without auscultation intestinal peristalsis.
No masses or enlargement were detected.
The extremities were normal.
▁Complementary laboratory tests revealed a significant leukocytosis (26,3660 cells/μL) (81% neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes, 1%▁eosinophils).
The patient also presented hemoglobin 1 g/dL, hematocrit 34% and 333,000/μL.
The coagulation study was normal.
Biochemistry showed creatinine 1.45 mg/dL, AST 70 IU/mL, LDH 589 IU/mL.
Blood glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, bilirubin, amylase and CPK were normal.
There were 10-20 leukocytes in the urine sediment per field.
The chest X-ray was normal, but the abdominal X-ray showed dilation of the loops of the small intestine, with no other findings.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the left liver lobe, with echogenic material inside, and free fluid in the Morrison space.
Abdominal CT showed a hypodense mass of 7x9 cm in the left liver lobe, with peripheral enhancement with contrast and small hypodense halo, compatible with liver abscess.
There was free fluid in the posterior perihepatic space.
The gallbladder and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts were normal, as well as the spleen, kidneys and intestinal loops.
Diagnostic test Serology against Entamoeba histolytica (indirect immunofluorescence technique) was positive at a titer of 1/640.
Clinical case Abscess amebic liver.
Laparotomy was performed. The lobule was diagnosed as a large abscess in the left liver, probably complicated and without the possibility of urgent percutaneous drainage.
During the surgery, the presence of an abscess in segments III-IV of the liver was confirmed, opening a window through which chopped purulent content emerged.
A sample was sent to Microbiology and an external drainage was placed after washing the cavity.
No breakage of the abscess or signs of peritonitis was observed.
Subsequently, empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin-taccinate 4-0.5 g every eight hours and metronidazole 750 mg/8 h. iv.
At 48 hours the patient became afflicted.
Hemocultives and microbiological study of liver abscess by Gram stain, Ziehl and culture in aerobic and anaerobic environment were negative.
On the fifth day, in view of the serological findings, the drainage was removed and metronidazole was maintained for 10 days.
Subsequently, she received▁paromomycin 500 mg/8 h for ten days.
At the follow-up visit, one month later, the patient was asymptomatic.
