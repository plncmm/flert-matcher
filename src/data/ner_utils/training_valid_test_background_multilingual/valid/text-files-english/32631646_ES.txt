A 61-year-old woman, born in Equatorial Guinea, resident in Spain for years, with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension, treated with lysinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, hypertensive heart disease, with surgical left ventricular ejection fraction preserved, surgical
The patient is being followed up by the Primary Care Team (EAP) for possible COVID-19, after being in contact with COVID-19 patient, initially referring mild gastrointestinal symptoms with nausea and diarrheal stools.
Given the absence of symptoms of severity, periodic telephone follow-up is performed by the PAD with symptomatic treatment, relative rest, abundant hydration and home isolation, and should be advised in case of worsening symptoms and/or explanation.
On the 4th day after the onset of symptoms, the patient reported dry cough and odynophagia, accompanied by dyspnea on the 9th day, no associated fever, no associated fever, no dysphonic feeling.
In the 3 week after the onset of symptoms, the patient complained of pain in the right lower limb (RLL) with edema, heat, flushing and increased‚ñÅperimeter compared to the contralateral limb, so she was referred to the emergency department.
Physical examination, including cardiopulmonary auscultation, showed no abnormalities.
BP: 134/73mmHg; HR: 108lpm; RR: 12rpm; SatO2 99%.
Blood tests were performed in the emergency department to show glucose 149mg/dl, LDH 319U/l (135-214), coagulation disorder 2.050ng/ml (208-500), with the rest of the biochemical parameters analyzed.
The chest X-ray showed an increase in the bronchovascular network and a doubtful infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
Doppler ultrasound shows patency of common femoral veins, superficial veins, popliteal veins, tibioperone trunk and geme veins, which rules out DVT.
suspected acute respiratory disease due to coronavirus (COVID-19), with unilobar pneumonia, hydroxychloroquine was prescribed.
Given the suggestive clinical signs of DVT and the association with elevation of consciousness and LMWH, compatible clinical symptoms with COVID-19, it was decided, taking into account the good status of the patient, the absence of dyspnea and the epidemiological protocol at the time.
Doppler ultrasound was repeated at 15 days, observing superficial venous thrombosis of 2cm in the distal third of the RLL (not adjacent to the saphenous vein), without bilateral DVT data.
The patient improved progressively, with no incidents or complications, so after one month of treatment with LMWH, and after confirming clinical improvement, being asymptomatic, it was decided to discontinue treatment with bemiparedema daily, maintaining physical measures.
