A three-year-old patient presented with oral pruritus and facial wheals after ingestion of cured cheeses and sheep.
Occasionally, after eating milk and cow's cheese, stridor and dysphonia arise.
You also had symptoms after eating other foods containing milk proteins (corn snacks, sausages).
Specific serum IgE was quantified for cow's milk casein (3.60 kU/L), and for cow's milk (42.3 kU/L) and sheep (5 kU/L).
Prick-prick test positive for cow's milk cheese (10x6 mm) and sheep (11x6 mm), and negative for cow's milk.
SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting: more intense fixation of IgE extracts from cow's milk and cow's milk (in bands probably corresponding to caseins).
Immunoblotting-inhibition: sheep's milk extracts are capable of completely inhibiting IgE fixation on cow's milk extract.
Conclusions: Comments.
We would be facing a primary case of breast cancer.
The patient‚ñÅtolerates cow's milk due to its habitual consumption, but occasionally it has reactions due to the existence of an important cross-reactivity with proteins of milk and sheep.
