A 31-year-old woman presented with a 2-3 day history of general‚ñÅmalaise with non bilious vomiting and cough accompanied by fever and dysuria, with a diagnosis of right lower lobe pneumonia.
Predictive scales for pneumonia were calculated: FINE 1 (mortality at 30 days < 1%).
CURB-65 (mortality 0.7%).
Given the prostration, hypoxemia and radiographic image, it was decided to enter internal medicine, despite the low scores of the scales.
Twenty-four hours after admission, clinical, blood gas and radiographic worsening motivated admission to the ICU due to septic shock meeting criteria for severe pneumonia according to ATS/IDSA 2007.
After 44 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of CAP, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, vocal cords in ileolytic candidiasis, hyponatremia, Candida parapsilosis, fibrosis and infiltrates.
He is currently being followed up in internal medicine and rehabilitation outpatient clinics for postpneumonia bedding syndrome.
It is composed of wheels, but with features and a walker at home.
She also attends speech therapy appointments for voice recovery.
Results: Once the diagnosis of CAP has been established, a prognostic assessment should be performed to decide whether or not the patient should be hospitalized and where.
The clinical judgment only identifies impasse and may be insufficient and depends on the responsible medical experience. It can assess or overestimate the severity of illness, so that the "scales of death that patients are likely to die and treat at the outpatient clinic" are considered.
Our patient with a calculated Fine of I and a low CRUB-65 would be treated as outpatients.
There was no data of severity in the first assessment, but the patient's delay, radiographic image and low oxygen saturation made the decision to hospitalize.
The evolution of CAP was poor, with admission to the ICU and all possible complications.
