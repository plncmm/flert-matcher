Parasitological diagnosis On September 14, 2009, after telephone consultation, were sent to the Laboratory of Intestinal Parasitism of the Subdirección de Parasitología at the Institute of Tropical Medicine "Pedro Kourí" had not yet been identified, but only one stool sampled in the same day but also had been taken from the same laboratory at 14
In the Parasitology Laboratory of IPK, both diarrheal samples were observed, with prominent terminal tapes of the genus Parasiapilla or thick tapered, with the presence of two layers.
These eggs were identified by direct microscopic examination with eosin and luteum, as well as by flotation techniques in salmon (Willis), and sedimentation by conical cup.
To verify the species, measurements of length and width of eggs were made using a tape measure with a BH-2 micrometric scale inserted into the eye lens.
Thirty eggs were measured.
All this led to the confirmation that Paracapillariaria eggs were present, because they were in the known length range of time, according to the description of infected patients by Fitwood in 1968c, and that they were in the network
The diagnosis was confirmed by the fourth stool test. The patient was suspected of having ascaridiasis by the laboratory, and taking into account the patient's poor general condition, she was started on September 12th, and the treatment with mebendazole at 200 mg each
In addition, the patient showed improvement in his general condition, 15 diarrheic stools per day and a weight of 37 kg at admission, decreased to 4 diarrheic stools per day in the first days of treatment.
