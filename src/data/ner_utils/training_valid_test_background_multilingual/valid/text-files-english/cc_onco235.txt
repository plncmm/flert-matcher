Anamnesis A 66-year-old woman, without allergies to known drugs, without toxic habits, currently retired, with no family history of cancer, with a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.
Independent for activities of daily living EC 0.
Her▁oncologic history began in March 2015 with pruritus in a skin lesion already known at the upper left dorsal level (perlated erythematous▁papule with teleangiectasia, 4 mm).
Excisional biopsy was performed.
Pathological anatomy reports Nodular Breslow Melanoma 2.5 mm, Clark level IV, absence of ulceration, non-inflammatory component, non-regression, pleomorphic cellularity, non-muscle vascular invasion margins.
BRAF V600E wild type mutational study.
Laboratory tests showed LDH levels in normal range.
PET-CT was performed, highlighting in the left axillary region 3 necrotic center adenopathies of 21 mm (two very close) and a third of 7.5 mm, maximum SUV of 10 and 2 respectively.
The right axillary region showed necrotic lymphadenopathy of 15 mm, maximum SUV of 6.
All were compatible with congenital origin.
-Axillary lymphadenopathy aspiration puncture was performed with pathological findings reporting melanoma metastasis.
-In May 2015 a 2 cm margin extension was performed with bilateral axillary lymphadenectomy.
There are no postsurgical complications.
The pathology report absence of residual tumor in surgical margins.
In relation to lymphadenectomy, it reports 4 positive nodes of 49 total lymph nodes (19 right▁ganglia, left lymph nodes, 35 mm, non-resected wildT 2015 maximum diameter), 30 adjuvant treatment (p = diagnosis of type melanoma.
This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, treatment with adjuvant immunotherapy with ipilimumab versus Nivolumab, after complete resection of stage IIIb/c or IV melanoma, in patients with recurrence.
Patients were randomized to: - branch A: Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV (intravenous) every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 12 weeks starting week 24 plus placebo IV every 2 weeks.
- branch B: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks plus placebo IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 12 weeks starting at week 24.
Treatment is performed until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 1 year.
Current disease: In August 2015 she came to a day hospital for diarrhea lasting 15 days, initially presenting 2-3 stools a day, with a progressive increase in number and intensity, the condition is associated with diffuse abdominal pain diarrhea rectal bleeding.
She also had fever in previous days, it should be noted that the patient had consulted in another center previously and was given ciprofloxacin treatment that she had done at the time of the assessment in a day hospital.
Establishment plan
Hemodynamically stable and afflicted.
The abdomen was distended slightly, painful to the palpation diffusely, both superficial and deep.
Conserved peristalsis.
▁Complementary tests: Anemia with hemoglobin 10.9 gr/dl, hypokalemia of 3.15 meq/litre, elevated C-reactive protein in 100.4 mg/dL, abdominal CT with minimal blindness was performed.
There were no other changes that could be evaluated by this method in the rest of the colon or signs of bleeding.
Multiple ulcerated lesions are performed with evidence at the level of the ascending colon and transverse colon in saccabulized with edges over elevated that are found in remnants of blood and fibrin,▁surrounded by healthy mucosa of wide
Biopsies are taken from the edges of the ulcer and its base.
It is reported as ulcerative colitis of undetermined origin.
The pathology reports fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration with granulation tissue and reparative changes in the adjacent epithelium.
No changes suggestive of viral infection.
With negative molecular biology results for cytomegalogivus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and Epstein&#146;s anomaly virus.
Samples of hemocultive, coprocultive and toxine clostridium difficile, all negative, were taken.
It was realized Quantiferon that is negative.
Diagnosis: This is a 66-year-old patient who underwent surgery for stage IIIC melanoma, under adjuvant treatment with immunotherapy, within a clinical trial (double blind, adjacent nivolumab versus mucosa-reconstructive epithelium with ulcerative colitis degree 3), with ulcerative colitis reparative mucosa, with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis with ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis without ulcerative colitis
No changes suggestive of viral infection.
In this context, we interpreted the picture as severe immune-mediated colitis.
Treatment: We started treatment with high-dose corticoids and received a single dose of infliximab with progressive clinical improvement, so we started the decrease of corticosteroids.
We also stopped ciprofloxacin and indicated empirical antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazodone.
During admission, total parenteral nutrition was indicated.
Ev: The patient evolves favorably, allowing to start oral tolerance, to change the treatment progressively to oral.
After approximately 30 days of admission, we indicated hospital discharge.
The patient was discharged from the clinical trial and received no further adjuvant treatment.
On an outpatient basis, the patient continued to show progressive decrease in corticoids until she was definitively stopped.
Currently under follow-up, CS 0, with no evidence of oncological disease or toxicity sequelae.
