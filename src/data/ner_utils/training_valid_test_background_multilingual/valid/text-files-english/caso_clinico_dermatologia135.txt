Anamnesis A 32-year-old woman with no personal history of interest consulted for a rash in the pubic region, which had initially developed pruritic and had become painful with occasional purpuration.
She had no other systemic symptoms except punctual dysthermic sensation.
She did not relate the process with previous triggers, although in the directed anamnesis she reported that one month before the onset of the symptoms she had had a vaginal delivery, when she was shaved.
She had no animals at home or contact with them, although her husband did.
She had risky sexual relations.
She had been treated empirically with a combination of topical betamethasone and fusidic acid, topical avir in cream and topical ciclopirox, without any improvement.
Platelet fever Platelet erythematoedema, indurated, with follicular nodules and pustules in its entirety encompassing the whole mountain of Venus to the left with warm extension to the groin vulsa
In the glutees, there were annular plaques of 2.5 cm (right) and 1 cm (left) in diameter with raised peripheral▁papules and scaling.
Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies, round, painful, small size were present.
When informed about the diagnostic suspicion, the husband showed desquamative and cyrcinate plaques on the back of the hand, forearm and right side of the hand, as well as some▁papules that did not reach the plaque.
Additional features A culture of hair from the patient's pubis plate and another of scabs on the back of her husband's hand was requested.
Microscopic examination of the colonies revealed numerous thin-walled spherical microconidia grouped into clusters, chlamyidosporas, identified as the spherical hyphae of the specie mixed, identifiable macroconidia macroconidia.
A punch biopsy of a pustule of the mountain of Venus was performed, in which a▁lymphotic infiltrate and▁eosinophils were observed, with no granuloma located at the level of reticular dermis and hypodermis.
Diagnosis Granuloma of Majocchi (and tinea corporis in your husband).
Treatment Treatment Treatment was established with oral terbinafine 250 mg daily and ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours for both.
▁Cyclopyrox treatment was also associated with topic.
After 4 weeks of treatment, the plaque of the mountain of Venus had markedly reduced its size and showed a residual appearance, while the glulites had completely resolved.
It was decided to extend treatment to 8 weeks with complete resolution of the condition, persisting an area of 2.5 cm of residual alopecia.
Her husband's injuries were resolved at 4 weeks, when it was decided to end the treatment.
