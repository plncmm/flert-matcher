» FAMILIAR HISTORY: Madre deceased at 72 years of brain tumor.
3 brothers, one died of cardiorespiratory arrest.
Maternal breast cancer at age 40
Pituitary discharge (70/45 mmHg), diaphoresis and mucocutaneous hypersensitivity.
Abdomen: painful to palpation diffusely with signs of peritoneal irritation.
▁Complementary tests - Analytical: She had anemia with Hb 8.7 g/dL (Hb 13.7 g/dL in analytical performed for 48 hours before).
-emergent abdominal CT: In the left hepatic lobe, a lobulated mass of 8x10x15 cm protruding outside the heterogeneous hepatic contour with peripheral enhancement.
Compress adjacent structures and lose separation with gastric antrum.
A large hematoma in the adjacent mesentery extending to the diaphragm.
Free intra-abdominal fluid
Probable peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Conclusion: Liver tumor rupture (probable hepatocellular carcinoma) with hemoperitoneum.
Diagnosis Hemoperitoneum secondary to rupture of liver tumor.
Treatment The patient underwent emergency surgery by extended right subcostal laparotomy.
2500 ml of hemoperitoneum were extracted, and a 15 cm hepatic tumor in segment II-III was observed. Liver resection of these segments, cholecystectomy, epiploic resection and biopsy of a segment IV lesion were performed.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the immediate postoperative period was 7043 ng/ml.
» Pathology: Segments II-III: moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 10x7x5.5 cm, trabecular and venous pattern.
Non-tumoral liver: non-cirrhotic liver.
Epip: 7.5x5 cm tumor suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma implantation.
Normal rectum.
Accreditation was granted to the On Medica outpatient clinic in September 2014 with AFP 627 ng/ml, Child-Pugh score 7 and advanced stage according to Staging System.
Anti-HCV antibodies▁resected but presence of peritoneal implants in surgery, it was decided to treat with Sorafenib 800 mg/day and serological tests for hepatotropic virus were requested, resulting positive for HBV infection.
After one month of treatment with AFP 29.86 ng/ml, with dermal toxicity G3, which requires a dose reduction.
Subsequently, increased AFP despite adequate dose increase, several hepatic MRIs were requested, which showed only simple cysts and post-surgical changes.
In March 2015 AFP 297 ng/ml was requested and a TAC-non-target was requested with the presence of a nonspecific 8 mm baseline pulmonary nodule with no other findings.
Good tolerance, we increased doses to 800 mg/day with good biochemical response, achieving in November 2015 AFP 80 ng/ml.
In early 2016, progressive elevation of AFP with an increase in size of the right basal pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm was observed.
Pulmonary segmentectomy pending for histological study today.
