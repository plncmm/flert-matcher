Anamnesis Anamnesis An 11-year-old girl without known drug allergies or relevant medical or surgical personal history, who came in September 2013 to consultation for progressive appearance of lesions on the dorsum of both hands that did not disappear after 6 months.
The lesions were not painful or pruritic, although sometimes they were "small".
Your pediatrician had treatment with fusidic acid ointment for 3 days without improvement and with oral antibiotics.
Do not contact animals.
She has no fish, she hasn't been in rivers.
Straight patient.
Physical examination In both backs of hands and left forearm▁papules of 0.7-1 cm in diameter, surface of liquenified and hypopigmented appearance with erosion on surface.
Lesions above everything in left hand and in right hand a single lesion of the same characteristics although less elevated.

• Pathological: negative.

• Biopsy: Hyperkeratosis ortokeratotic, acanthosis and superficial ulceration, in papillary dermis vascular proliferation with dilated capillaries.
No foreign material was observed.
PAS and Ziehl-Nielsen stains did not show acid-fast bacilli resistant.
Diagnosis of artifact.
Ev and treatment After the first diagnostic impression, the patient was self-harmed by excoriation with her own nails or other object.
In the first consultation, cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria were performed.
Mupirocin ointment was applied 1/12 hours for 15 days and was reevaluated.
After seeing that there was no improvement, and their relatives demanded a diagnosis, they were treated with Betamethasone and Gentamicin cream plus bandage 1 application every 12 hours 15 days and oral antibiotic therapy.
The patient and family members were asked in separate interviews if the lesions could be self-harmed and the school, family, psychic and social situation of the patient at all times denying the self-harm and self-harm.
The patient came to consultation without the bandage and with the lesions in the same state, a biopsy of one of the lesions was proposed.
Associated with this, we opted for a tapering of both hands and forearms without including fingers and warned the patient that the bandage would only be removed in the service in 10 days.
After improvement, it was proposed to follow 7 more days.
The rapid improvement of the lesions that had previously been refractory to other therapies, together with the appearance of a new lesion in a previously unaffected site (left third toe dorsum of diagnosis) supported the diagnosis.
Psychiatry has been consulted for interdisciplinary therapeutic approach.
