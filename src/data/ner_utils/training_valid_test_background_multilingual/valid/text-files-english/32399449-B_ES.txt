A 64-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department complaining of fever and dry cough, treated with antibiotics during the previous 10 days.
A bedside ultrasound revealed diffuse B lines with biphasic consolidations, also documented by chest X-ray.
A nasopharyngeal smear confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
The patient's medical history was anodyne and she did not take any medication.
The ECG showed a right bundle branch block of His (BRDHH).
Darunavir/colic agent, hydroxychloroquine and LMWH were prescribed at a preventive dose and low-flow nasal spectra were administered.
He was discharged after 10 days, in good health and without oxygen.
The CIS score was below 4, so that LMWH administration was interconnected.
However, one week later the patient came to our emergency department again with acute chest pain upon breathing (SpO2 97%, PaO2/FiO2 341 mmHg in the left environmental air) and pain in the left environment (3 days after discharge).
She reported no history of venous thrombosis or family history of thrombophilia.
The clinical suspicion of DVT was confirmed by a compressive ultrasound without‚ñÅcompressibility of the left popliteal vein.
The echocardiogram was normal.
A lung ultrasound showed focal B lines and left basal consolidation with mild pleural effusion.
ECG results did not vary (RSN, BRDHH).
A CT pulmonary angiography revealed left subsegmental pleural effusion with diffuse ground glass opacities and a patchy pattern (visual CAT index 5%).
Another nasopharyngeal smear was obtained, which yielded a low positive result.
Fondaparinux was started immediately at high doses and switched to dabigatran twice daily after 5 days.
The patient was discharged without sequelae on day 6.
