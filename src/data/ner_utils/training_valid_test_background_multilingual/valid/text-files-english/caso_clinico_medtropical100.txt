A 38-year-old male from Senegal, who had been living in Spain for only 20 days, with no relevant medical history, was admitted to the hospital due to the appearance of a few asymptomatic skin lesions.
He had been treated with topical and systemic antibiotics without obtaining any response.
Physical examination revealed two ulcerated nodules on the back and volar side of the right wrist, 5 cm long axis, with a necrotic and friable center and raised edges.
The rest of the physical examination was normal, including absence of lymphadenopathy.
The differential diagnosis was made mainly with bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, malignant tumors and tropical ulcer infections.
A 6 mm punch biopsy of the lesion edges was performed and culture for bacteria, mycobacteria was performed, resulting negative.
The result of the biopsy showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial and deep dermis, accompanied by numerous oval bodies of a host with intra-cellular forms, both inside and outside the mosquitoes, which correspond to
The microbiological diagnosis was cutaneous leishmaniasis by L. major, meeting the clinical and epidemiological criteria.
Since the lesions of our patient were multiple, large and very large, we opted for a systemic treatment with glucantime (anti-inflammatory medication administered intramuscularly) 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days.
One month after treatment, the lesions showed clear signs of regression, in the form of hypopigmented tricles, somewhat depressed and somewhat unsightly.
