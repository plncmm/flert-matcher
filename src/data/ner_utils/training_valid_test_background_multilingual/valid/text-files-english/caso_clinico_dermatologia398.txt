Anamnesis Lionfish poisoning (Pterois volitans) is an exceptional reason for consultation in the Emergency Department of our country.
However its presence in domestic aquariums is becoming more common, for which it is necessary to know the clinical and management of this poisoning to avoid potentially dangerous complications.
A 34-year-old man with no relevant medical or surgical history came to the emergency room after an hour before puncture of the third finger of his right hand with a lionfish bone.
Puncture occurred while cleaning the domestic watery where the fish was.
Immediately after it, she began with intense pain and swelling at the level of the finger, which rapidly progressed to the distal third of the arm.
She had no nausea, vomiting or other systemic symptoms, and was hemodynamically stable and afflicted.
Physical examination revealed significant edema of the right hand, as well as the presence of a poorly defined▁cyanotic area in the third finger pulp of the hand.
No spinal remnants, active bleeding or other puncture sites were observed.
There were no other data on local infection.
▁Pulses were fixed at all levels and the patient maintained active mobility as well as passive mobility of the hand.
▁Complementary tests An urgent blood count, hemostasis and basic biochemical tests were performed and were normal.
Diagnosis Leonfish poisoning.
Treatment Analgesia was achieved with subcutaneous pethidine 50 mg and washed in water at 50oC with povidone and jabonosa.
Since the patient did not remember if he had completed the correct tetanus prophylaxis, a booster dose was administered.
The patient reported great pain improvement after intermittent immersion in hot water for 120 minutes.
Since the patient had remained stable during observation in the emergency department, discharge was decided with recommendations and symptomatic treatment.
A week later, the patient was re-evaluated, who presented only a superficial crust in the third finger pulp of the hand, without areas of necrosis or loss of associated substance.
