A 56-year-old patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
She was admitted for several weeks of fever, chills,‚ñÅmalaise, vomiting and diffuse pain in the chest and lumbar region.
On physical examination, the patient presented acceptable general condition, temperature 39oC, and systolic murmur of intensity II/VI in the mitral focus irradiated to the left axilla, while the rest of the examination was normal.
Blood tests showed white blood cells 11,400/mm3 (69% granulocytes), platelets 92,000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 52mm in the first hour, glucose 281 mg/dl and alkaline phosphatase 322 mg/dl.
In urine, 100 mg/dl of proteins, 250 mg/dl of glucose and 25 erythrocytes per field are detected in the sediment.
Anterior hemiblock is observed on the electrocardiogram as the only change.
Chest and spine X-rays, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography are normal.
Echocardiography showed a destructured mitral valve with both valves.
Streptococcus a is the most common cause of bacteremia in hemocultives, so cefoxime is administered intravenously every 8 hours.
At first, a good clinical response occurs, with disappearance of fever, but 5 days after starting treatment the patient starts to notice episodes, dyspnea and ortopnea, and the fever reappears.
At this time, the systolic murmur is at an intensity of IV/VI, and abundant crackles are heard in both bases of the chest.
The new chest X-rays reflect alterations highly suggestive of acute pulmonary edema.
Control echocardiography showed greater mitral valve destructuring, presence of vegetations in both mitral valve leaflets and severe mitral regurgitation.
Despite the failure of diuretics, vasodilators, high-dose penicillin and gentamicin therapy, the patient progresses unfavorably, develops a third-degree atrioventricular block, which requires surgical implantation while the patient is undergoing a temporary treatment.
