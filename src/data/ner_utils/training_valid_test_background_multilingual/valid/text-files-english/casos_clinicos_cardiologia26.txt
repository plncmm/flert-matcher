A 72-year-old white man with a history of apparent health and no evidence of heart valve disease before 2 months before admission began to present fever and weakness, with general health and exertional dyspnea.
Fever was never higher than 39oC and it usually appeared in the afternoon.
Initially it was quickly stopped with the usual antipyretic measures, but it became more persistent until it appeared for 10 and 12 hours a day.
In his health area he was treated as a fever of origin until leukocytes and‚ñÅerythrosedimentation unknown were found.
The cause was not specified yet. Penicillin treatment was started and on the fifth day amikacin was associated because the desired improvement was not achieved.
Then, a systolic murmur III/VI was found at the apex and at the center to perform an echocardiogram and physical examination. The apex irradiated to the axilla with a small diastolic murmur, presence of both lung bases crackles.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed a mass on the posterior mitral valve compatible with vegetation type endo.
We decided to admit the patient with the diagnostic impression of persistent cough. We took samples for hemocultives and started treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin thinking about the possibility of a negative Staphylococcal aureus as the causative agent 8
We took samples for special culture media and found the presence of C. albicans as we started treatment with amphotericin B, but despite diminishing the fever, the hemodynamic state did not improve.
The patient underwent mitral valve replacement without complications, using a bi-disk mechanical prosthesis.
The anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis.
The patient completed his hospital cycle of amphotericin B and was discharged with oral ketoconazole, in addition to digitalis, diuretics and anticoagulants.
