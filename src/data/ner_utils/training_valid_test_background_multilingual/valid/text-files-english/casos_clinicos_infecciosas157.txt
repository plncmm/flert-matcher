A 72-year-old male, ex-smoker of 15 cigarettes per day, with no other toxic habits.
His history included mild COPD and psoriasis.
She was diagnosed in January 2017 with epidermoid carcinoma of the pyriform sinus (cT4cN3M0), and was treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and treatment with dexamethasone in July, docetaxel and corticoid therapy.
In September 2017, the patient came to the emergency department due to cough and respiratory secretions, with scarce brownish expectoration of 4 days of evolution, dyspnea and maximum temperature of 36.4o thermometered.
He also complained of pain in the left hemithorax, which increased with deep▁inspiration and movements.
On physical examination, the patient has a regular general condition; EC type 3 (assigned more than 50% of the day), cachectic, mucocutaneous dryness and saturation of 95% with MV at 35%.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic cardiac sounds in good frequency, with no murmurs, decreased generalized vesicular murmur, with no audible crackles.
Abdominal examination showed no pathological findings, but no edema or signs of thrombosis.
▁Complementary tests performed at the beginning showed hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl, 10,980 leukocytes/mm3 with 96% neutrophils, platelets and coagulation normal.
Glucose, renal function, glucose, LDH, GOT, GPT, lipase and amylase were normal.
Antigenuria for pneumococcus and Legionella spp negative.
The chest X-ray showed extensive parenchymal involvement with alveolointerstitial infiltrates, nodules and bilateral cavitations.
In a chest plate performed one month before this consultation, no alteration is described.
Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of cavitated lesions is very broad and includes diverse pathologies, infectious processes, abscesses (bacteria, mycobacterial, septic, other diseases), emboli.
Pulmonary cavitary lesions comprise a wide range of benign and malignant entities.
It is very important to establish the temporality of the evolution of the process to establish an approximate diagnosis since more acute/subacute lesions lead us to an infectious etiology and chronic lesions to a malignant nature.
Neoplasms: Among the lung▁neoplasms, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most frequently cavitated.
This diagnosis is ruled out by the existence of normal previous tests, as well as the suspicion of metastatic cavitated lesions.
Pulmonary septic emboli: Septic emboli usually manifest radiographically as multiple nodules at peripheral level in the lower lobes that can cavitate.
The absence of fever and other factors, such as right endocarditis, thromboeb, infection of the bladder and parenteral drugs cause this diagnosis to be unlikely.
Infections: The presence of immunosuppression in a patient with prolonged doses of corticosteroids, associated with manifest respiratory symptoms (e.g., expectoration and pleuritic pain), despite the absence of fever, guides us to a
• Fungal infections can manifest as cavitated lesions with variable thickness walls.
In the case of aspergillosis, a predisposing factor in this type of pathogen is cellular immunosuppression caused by the use of corticosteroids, data in favor of our case; although patients usually appear more frequently in a neutropenic condition.
A finding that could go against this diagnosis is the absence of the halo sign, which is only a circular area of ground-glass attenuation surrounding a pulmonary nodule that usually appears within 1-2 weeks.
Serum positivity for β-D glucan and antigenmanan in serum, as well as for manmade in bronchoalveolar lavage support this diagnosis.
Mucormycosis usually has a radiological manifestation similar to aspergillosis, particularly present in patients with glycemic control and diabetic patients with a history of ketosis, not characterized by episodes of massive hemoptysis,
The possibility of isolation of cystis jirovecii is unlikely given that it is not a patient with HIV infection, a typical association with this etiology.
• Necrotizing bacterial pneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, usually associated with single cavitation within a bilateral presentation, but not diffuse lung consolidation.
Another etiology to consider is tuberculosis.
The presence of infiltrates in the lung parenchyma with multiple satellite nodules and cavitated lesions are the most common radiological manifestation (in 40% of cases), which associated with nonspecific respiratory symptoms and cellular immunosuppression can guide this diagnosis.
The acute evolution presented by our patient does not favor the suspicion of this diagnosis, since tuberculosis presents a more subacute/chronic evolution.
The positivity in certain complementary tests such as interferon gamma, tuberculin skin test or sputum culture would support the diagnosis.
The absence of lymphadenopathy goes against our patient.
The prolonged use of corticoid therapy without prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole and the presence of pulmonary cavitation make us consider the suspicion of nocardiosis.
▁Definitive diagnosis requires isolation and identification of the organism in routine aerobic cultures (bronchoalveolar lavage) and blood cultures.
The absence of fever and leukocytosis does not rule out this diagnosis.
▁Complementary manifestations associated with tuberculosis admission indicated respiratory isolation, fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy and sputum culture. Empirical treatment was initiated with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and the tests were performed until obtaining results.
It remains hemodynamically stable at the beginning, with saturation of O2 at 91% with nasal glasses at 2 min, although with desaturations around 85% at room air and respiratory work.
The patient presents a clear clinical worsening in the following days (asthenia, hemodynamic instability, malnutrition...) and rapid radiological progression objectified by chest X-ray, where a clear increase in diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate CT is observed, so high resolution is requested.
Analytically, the decrease in hemoglobin 8.1 g/dl (previously 12.1 g/dl), maintained normalization of leukocytes 4710/μg (neutrophils 3 mg/23 mg CRP (pre) stands out.
Fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy showed bilateral bronchial secretions of purulent secretions from both trees, which were analyzed in pathological anatomy and microbiology with opportunistic germ study.
Due to the rapid evolution, sputum smear microscopy revealed three sputum smears with Ziehl Neelsen's technique. Negative diagnosis of amphotericin B tuberculosis was suspended and empirical treatment with meropenem was initiated.
On high resolution chest CT, extensive lung lesions were observed, with bilateral cavitations, cavitations associated with both infiltrates (consolidations) and nodules, and no clear tree-in-bud images were observed.
Given the clinical data, and the extent of involvement should be considered as the first possibility an affectation, assessing largely an etiology of atypical germs; not including invasive fungal infections less prevalent as other infectious diseases g.
Pleural effusion was moderate in left side and mild in right side.
In sputum culture, bronchial aspirate and telescopated catheter were isolated cyriacigeorgical non resistant, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
In bronchioalveolar lavage, the parasitemanano and antigen ofcystis jirovecii were negative.
Serum β -D-glucan and mannan levels were also negative.
The antibiotic therapy is modified based on the antibiogram obtained, suspending the antifungal, maintaining cotrimoxazole with imipenem – amikacin and decreasing the dose of corticosteroids.
Despite this antibiotic therapy, the patient presented a rapid clinical deterioration, with septic shock refractory to the measures administered.
She died one day later from the start of directed antibiotic therapy.
Final diagnosis 1.
Bilateral pneumonia due to non-cygeorgic fever in immunosuppressed patients.
2.
Septic shock with data of refractory acute respiratory failure.
