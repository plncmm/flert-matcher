Anamnesis We present a 72-year-old woman from Barcelona, married.
A total of three unaffected children with good family support were identified.
He was retired from 65 years old and a master of the profession.
No relevant family history of cancer.
She also did not report toxic habits and had a history of hypertension treated with enalapril.
Gynecologic history of 3 pregnancies, 3 eutocic births and 3 healthy live children.
She presented the first menstrual cycle at 9 years old and the mental disorder at 40 years old.
Its oncological history begins in early September with a clinical picture characterized by abdominal pain radiating to the belt accompanied by early fullness, anorexia with a quantified loss of 5 kg in one month and moderate asthenia.
Physical examination revealed a clear general state of health, with a performance status of 2 and abdominal disorientation a viscera of hepatomegaly of four fingertips without signs of ascites.
He also presents important mucocutaneous ignition.
No cardiac or respiratory abnormalities were observed.
▁Complementary tests » An abdominal ultrasound was performed in the emergency department showing hepatomegaly due to multiple space occupying lesions, so she was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department for study.
» During the initial analytical workup, a doubling of ALT levels was performed in patients with normal transaminase levels (ALT 61 stasis non-functioning (AST 1.02 μkat/L, ALT 1.21 μkat/L).
It has increased several tumor markers, among which stand out antigen Ca-19-9 of 618 kint.u/l, antigen antigen Personal/lugrogenic 992.2ug/l and alpha4.9-fetoprotein (AFP).
Serology ruled out hepatitis.
» Abdominal CT was performed, which showed tumoral hepatomegaly due to multiple focal bilobular hypervascular lesions, endovesicular tumoral masses metastases with hypervascular characteristics compatible with hypervascular tumors.
No lesions with tumor characteristics in the pelvis were observed.
The semiology described in conjunction with radiology raised the differential diagnosis between multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma on healthy liver, extragonadal germ cell tumor of the liver and endovesicular metastases in the presence of liver metastases and endovesicular melanoma suggesting hypervascularization.
the most common diagnosis is gallbladder carcinoma, probably due to multiple metastases.
» Ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed without incident.
Pathological anatomy is described as a neoplasm adopting a papillary tubular growth pattern.
Proliferation of nuclei and the presence of subnuclear vacuums were ruled out.
At the level of the papillae, which show a fibrovascular axis, the vacules are adjacent to the fibrovascular axis and the tubular component is adjacent to the stroma around.
Cells show nuclear pleomorphism and mitosis is identified.
No necrosis was observed.
Immunohistochemistry with focal positivity for alpha-fetoprotein.
CK7, CK20 and estrogen receptors.
These findings are suggestive of endometroid yolk salk tumor.
Diagnosis It is therefore suggested as a germ cell tumor of the extragonadal endoderm sinus (yolk sac tumor) located in the liver and gallbladder without remnants of primary gonadal tumor.
Treatment Because it is a chemosensitive tumor according to the medical literature, but due to the fragility and great deterioration of our patient, it was decided to start chemotherapy according to the scheme of hepatic impairment 80% (etoposis).
The patient receives only one cycle, which is welcome.
Liver damage despite treatment, the patient presents a rapid clinical deterioration, so in December 2013 tumor markers were determined again, which paradoxically are slightly lower, and a CT scan was performed.
However, it presents with bilateral▁frank ascites and portal thrombosis of new onset.
The patient requires admission in December by the general hospital, presenting multiple complications, among which we highlight respiratory infection due to Haemophilus influenzae and malignant as regards the deterioration of the disease.
Given the complications that arise during the treatment, conditioning a performance status of 2-3, and given the poor clinical response to treatment, we consider a late death center more oncospecific treatment and disease derived to the Unit.
