Anamnesis A 7-month-old male, born at term by instrumental delivery with vacuum, with no other relevant personal history.
The patient presented whitish lesions with annular arrangement in the scalp since the second day of life that had increased in size and number since its appearance.
Due to the probable congenital nature of the dermatosis, the anamnesis was completed by asking the mother for a personal history of genital lesions.
The mother reported the presence of lesions at the inguinal and inguinal levels two years before the conception by which she had been treated with imiquimod and trichloracetic acid according to her primary care physician.
Both the patient and the mother had no history of immunosuppression.
Physical examination revealed multiple whitish▁papules with a moisturized center, following an annular distribution of considerable diameter.
The maternal physical examination revealed lesions with the same characteristics as those presented by her child, covering the inner face of both thighs.
▁Complementary tests Several complementary tests were performed, including serology for screening STI of the mother that were negative, besides curettage of one of the lesions of the infant and another of the histopathological lesions of the mother for confirmation.
After this study findings were compatible with molluscs in both cases.
Diagnosis was compatible with molluscum contagiosum by vertical transmission.
Treatment All lesions presented by both mother and infant were curettaged.
Ev More than 3 months after treatment, both the patient and his mother have not presented lesions suggestive of molluscum contagiosum.
