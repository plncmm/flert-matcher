A 42-year-old male with aggressive periodontal disease, without any other relevant pathology, was referred to our service.
The intervention followed the sequence: - Supracrestal incision with posterior and medial discharges to avoid flap tension and properly locate the following mentons.
- Severe post-extraction alveoli cure if any.
- Menton identification.
- Rice regulation, ensuring that all implants remain at the same height or gingival.
- 2 mm strawberry central osteotomy at a depth of 10; this is confirmed by direction indicator that the osteotomy is perpendicular to the bipupilary line.
- All-on-4 position: this is a guide (Nobelbiocare ®), which, thanks to its marks and references, allows placement of implants away from the surgical field (restorative attachment of the tongue) a
Local anesthesia is a rare condition with a 30o inclination.
Observe the presence of the right distal molar that served the patient for retention of the removable prosthesis and that we will extract in the same session.
- Also note the presence on the left side of an anti-aesthetic diapneusia in the lower lip commissure that will subsequently be removed by conventional surgical excision.
- We also see that the bed of preparation of the right distal implant is in the vertical position of the chin exit.
- We performed the corresponding drilling and inserted the right distal implant (Brånemark implant of Nobelbiocare ®, Ti-Unite Groovy of 3.75 x 15), of the same dimensions used.
- Care should be taken not to use an excessive number of frequency a
- We always use a hazelnut raft in distal implants, so that they are submerged (infrared) so that they do not fix the distal incline due to mesial inclinations.
- Once the first distal implant was placed, the corresponding multiunit abutment at 30o was inserted.
Figure 4 shows the 30o inclination of the implant, corrected with a column with the same bipuar bonding, resulting in a perpendicular to the crest and, as we intend, to the line.
- We repeated the procedure with left distal implant/pilar.
- Next, we prepare for mesial implants to maintain parallelism and equidistant between them and with the distal ones.
- We placed in already inserted mesial implants, being straight multi-unit abutments.
- Then, we applied the appropriate torque (15 N cm in the posterior implants and 35 in the anterior ones) as these abutments will never be deinsert again (the provisional and definitive prostheses will be manufactured on them).
- Then screw provisional titanium cylinders which will later be embedded in the provisional prosthesis and sutured around them with absorbable suture.
- Once the entire incision has been sutured, the cylinders are unscrewed and a circular scalpel is used around the multi-unit▁pillars so that, in the tornillated and desaccinated minutes, the medications will not come together.
- We tested the passive side of the prosthesis, lowering it if necessary.
Removal of the prosthesis with silicone dense and we send the patient a bite.
Once set, the marks of the multi-unit▁pillars on it will mark the points where we must pierce the prosthesis, a maneuver that we then do.
- Return to the titanium cylinders.
- We tested the passive seat of the perforated prosthesis and checked whether the cylinders allowed the maximum intercuspation; if not, we removed the cylinders until it was allowed.
- We placed a rubber tip to isolate the surgical field during subsequent maneuvers.
- We put cotton balls on the chimneys of the cylinders and close the perforations of the stent with soft wax.
- We dried the prosthesis well and passed it with self-curing resin and sent the patient in a position to bite.
- We removed waxtapons and filled them with more occlusal resin, leaving only access to the earmold.
- Let's let the whole settling, unscrew and check stability of cylinders already embedded in the stent.
- We fill the holes (pores) with more resin and cut the cylinders at the edge of the stent.
Removal of the prosthesis' distal fins and fins (in the provisional stage we do not leave practically cantilever); we remove the rubber tip.
- We also remove any resin in contact with the ridge. To this end, we used GC Fit-checker® as a base, which indicates the area which exerts pressure on the ridge.
- We place the prosthesis, we screw it permanently at 15 N cm and adjust occlusion.
- At 15 days the patient comes for review and we remove the suture to which we have access; the rest, being resorbable, do not worry - We trained on this occasion to treat only the patient in the optimal hygiene.
-▁Periodic revisions were carried out until the final prosthesis was manufactured after 5-6 months.
During this period, it is not necessary to unblock the provisional prosthesis.
