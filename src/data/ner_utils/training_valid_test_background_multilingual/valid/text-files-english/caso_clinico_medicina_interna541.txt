A 45-year-old patient without known cardiovascular risk factors, who only smoked daily.
Sex was defined as homosexual, with high-risk sexual relations continuously and Chemsex use without intravenous drugs (GHB and Poppers).
The patient presented progressive asthenia and a purplish papular rash on the trunk and extremities of 3 days of evolution. The patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation.
At the initial physical examination, there was evidence of extreme thinness, different lesions were observed in different stages, some footprints respected the soles of palms and some ribs of the tongue with a painful necrotic edge in the trunk.
Normal rectum.
It is evaluated in conjunction with▁dermatology at 24 hours of follow-up and biopsy of a lesion, as well as aspiration of fluid from a gallbladder.
HIV positivity was confirmed with an initial viral load of 150,000 copies and▁lymphocytic mass of 400 CD4+.
The biopsy result showed nonspecific inflammation, but the gallbladder aspirate showed Treponema in the trunk. This finding confirms high titers of positivity in the general laboratory.
A literature review was performed due to the atypical skin lesions that initially raised the doubt between activation of varicella.
The description of a very rare form of presentation of the secondary luetic syndrome called malignant syphilis that can occur in patients with impaired cellular immunity is observed.
The presence of bacteria in the lesions confirms the diagnostic hypothesis.
One week after the treatment with benzathine penicillin, the lesions had been confirmed.
Few cases of this form of presentation have been described, however, in a patient with a recent diagnosis of HIV infection, it should be kept in mind as part of the differential diagnosis always.
