We report the case of a 41-year-old male patient from Arg, Cauca, who is currently living in Agua de Dios Cundinamarca (Albergue Boyacá).
It begins its first representative symptoms in its second decade of life due to long-standing skin lesions that did not respond to multiple topical treatments.
Skin lesions associated with erythematous plaques and▁papules that generated a sensation of hypoesthesia, alopecia and anhidrosis in extremities and trunk, as well as▁papules that progressed to generalized nodules.
Additionally, he presented pain in the course of bilateral ulnar nerve trunk.
Patient who then didn't consult.
At the age of 34 years, she presented worsening of her clinical condition with madarosis, absence of eyelashes, sero-sanguineous rhinorrhea followed by constant epiphora, skin lesions that increased in number.
Upper and lower extremities affectation without uptake when painful stimulus is present, loss of strength in hands, osteoarticular deformities.
Family member of first line consanguinity of Hansen's disease (mother), who received monotherapy with dapsone, maintained close coexistence prior to treatment, currently mother with death data from unrelated pathology.
It is valued for the first time in San Agua de Dios Cundinamarca.
Physical examination revealed leonine facies, diffuse tricial septal lesions with hyperchromic characteristics, madarosis, absence of eyelashes, no alteration in the anterior nasal lobe corner with multiple perforation of the eyeball.
erythematous plaques without anhidrosis and without alopecia, thickening of the radial ulnar trunk and
In face: multiple madtric nodules with residual atrophic hyperpigmentation, appearance of firm ecryl nose, nasal pymoid collapse; C. auricular pearls: multiple▁papules.
Multiple leprommas, occipital sequels due to altered mental status, involvement of the radial and median ulnar nerve - hand pondulum - hand in claw.
A presumptive diagnosis of leprosy was made to the lepromatous pole by clinic and confirmatory paraclinical supports are indicated as: 1.
Nasal mucus and interstitial fluid bacilloscopy with data reporting with Colombian semiquantitative scale.
- Initial bacilloscopy with a bacillary index (BI) of 2.2 without morphology studies confirmed the bacteriological diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy.
2.
Skin biopsy with incisional technique
- Histopathology: reported thinned orthokeratotic epidermis separated by a wide collagen band of diffuse, extensive dermal infiltrate consisting of spindle cells included in dense collagen with some macrophages.
Some bacilli and granulo forms are seen with Fite-Faraco staining.
No nerves are seen.
Histioid lepromatous leprosy was diagnosed.
Treatment was initiated with adult multi-drug resistant PQT (ri-fampicin 600 mg once a month, dapsone 100 mg daily and cloacal therapy with stable drug regimen according to WHO 300 mg once a day).
At 24 months the patient did not show clinical improvement, persistence and increase of cutaneous lesions, polyneuropathy with increasing sensory-motor alteration.
Bacteriological controls with evidence of increased bacillary index and morphological viability test with high percentage of solid bacilli.
- At six months of age in treatment with MB PCT of 2.6 with a morphological study of 90 % solids and 10 % fragmented.
- At 11 months of age in treatment with adult MBQT: 0.4.
- At 24 months of treatment with adult MBQP according to scheme for the time of 24 months with
Given the worsening of clinical dermato-neurological manifestations and bacteriological association with bacterial viability, resistance studies are initiated.
3.
Resistance studies, Mycobacterium leprae susceptibility test, Genotype Leprae-DR Method. Identification by molecular genetics and their mutations in rpoB, gyrA and folpi genes.
▁Evaluated bacillary index 1.3. Report is obtained that reports that there was no amplification of DNA from the surveyed sample, the test requires a bacillary index higher than 2.5.
