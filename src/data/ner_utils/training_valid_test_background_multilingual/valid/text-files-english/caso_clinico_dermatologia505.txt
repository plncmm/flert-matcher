We report the case of a 68-year-old man with no relevant past medical history who came to the▁dermatology emergency department of our hospital with a 5-day history of a pruritic rash located in the forearm.
The patient reported that 6 days earlier he had been cutting, mounting and manipulating plants that had suffered from the terrain of a friend, hanging in a stream.
During the process, the patient suffered from short pantalon and short-handed shirt.
Thanks to the description and a picture that the patient subsequently showed us, it was concluded that the plant belonged to the Anaiaceae family, and was more specifically a poisonous hyedra.
On physical examination, he presented erythematous and edematous plaques and vesicles in both forearms and purpuric spots due to confluence of punctiform macules in the bilateral pretibial region.
A biopsy of one of the lesions in the forearm showed a superficial perivascular▁lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, spongiosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes in the epidermis and edema; data compatible with the diagnosis of eccema.
Betamethasone sulfate 0.5 mg/g cream twice daily and oral antihistamines were prescribed.
One month later, after resolution of the skin lesions, patch tests were performed (True Test® battery), whose reading was negative at 48 and 96 hours.
Therefore, the diagnosis of acute irritant contact dermatitis due to venomous hydra was confirmed.
