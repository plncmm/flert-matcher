A 40-year-old male, without known drug allergies, toxic habits or personal history of interest, who came to the emergency department with a vespertine fever of up to 38oC of 3 weeks duration.
Likewise, the febricula was accompanied by a punctual episode of sweating profuse and asthenia lasting more than one and a half month.
The patient also complained of occasional shoulder and lumbar arthralgias, which was related to her job (physical restraint).
She presented with otorhinolaryngological, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous or urological symptoms.
As epidemiological background we can highlight contact with a horse and a dog but the latter was correctly vaccinated.
During the physical examination, the patient was conscious and oriented, with good general condition.
The patient was eupneic at rest,笆》olerating decubitus, afflicted and hemodynamically stable with 135 mmHg pressure values.
Basal saturation of 100% oxygen.
Temporal arteries were beaten symmetrically.
Examination of the external ear, middle ear, mouth and pharynx was normal.
No cervical lymphadenopathies were detected.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic tones at 95 bpm, with no murmurs, pinks or extracts, and preserved vesicular murmur, with no pathological sounds.
The abdomen was blushing, depressible, with no masses or organomegaly and painless.
The lower limbs had no edema or ischemic signs or venous thrombosis.
Neurological examination was also normal.
The complementary tests initially performed in the emergency department were: blood tests with blood count and biochemistry, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray.
Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities except elevated acute phase reactants with C-reactive protein of 74 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 84mm/h.
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, normal cardiac axis, narrow QRS complexes and no acute changes in repolarization.
The chest X-ray showed no remarkable pleuroparenchymal alterations.
Blood samples were obtained for hemocultives.
Additional clinical features and the results of the tests described, it was decided to enter the hospital for study and treatment in the infectious diseases ward.
Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis should be made with all the causes of prolonged febrile syndrome.
The existence of intra-abdominal abscesses, mononucleic tuberculosis syndromes (Citomegalovirus, Epstein-HIV virus, disseminated and extrapulmonary) should be ruled out.
On the other hand, it should be considered that the origin may be tumor, a common fact in leukemias, carcinomas (especially colon, renal, hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic lesions), sarcomas, and atrial myxoma.
The possibility of rheumatic fever, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and hypercoagulable states should also be considered, such as antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus anticoagulant.
笆，omplementary tests that help us to guide the diagnosis include peripheral blood smears, proteinogram, blood levels of thyroid hormones and angiotensin converting enzyme, blood test, stools, blood test, blood culture, blood culture
Once the patient was admitted again, after verbal growth microbiology report 24 hours after admission of Gram-positive笆…occi in the chain of difficult typing in the current hemoculptives, anti-emergency therapy was requested.
From the plant the study was extended with tests of autoimmunity, being negative all autoantibodies.
Internal medicine and thyroid abnormalities were normal, obtaining a procalcitonin of 0.1 ng/mL.
The study of plasma proteins by proteinogram was normal, as well as the study of immunoglobulins.
The tumor markers studied appeared within the normal range.
The serology requested were: Epstein-Bar virus,笆，ytomegalovirus and Parvovirus B19, all of them IgG positive and IgM negative.
HIV screening was negative.
The following serologies were also requested: Brucella spp., Y Borcella spp., Y Borinia spp., Chlamydia, Chlamydia, Legionella spp., and All Salmonella spp., Arelia C.
The chest X-ray and the lumbar spine were imaging tests with no remarkable changes.
Subsequently, treatment was modified when the growth of Granule Elgans was confirmed. Antimicrobial reagents were decreased, and treatment was administered with ampicillin and gentamicin, thus reducing the levels of acute reactants.
During admission, a change was observed in the patient's auscultation, it was a rough ejective murmur in the aortic focus, so given the high suspicion of infective endocarditis, a transthoracic echocardiographic examination was performed.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: vegetation on the aortic valve.
A transesophageal echocardiography was recommended.
A bicuspid aortic valve with thickening of both leaflets and posterior raphe calcification with suggestive image of vegetation; severe aortic insufficiency; thickening of the descending aorta was observed.
The ultrasound showed a bit of homogeneous morphology, size (14 cm long), the rest of the abdominal examination being enlarged pelvic not being normal.
Repeated control blood cultures were negative.
Antibiotic treatment was completed with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin for 4 weeks and intravenous amoxicillin until completing 6 weeks of treatment, the patient was discharged, remaining asymptomatic and in good functional class, with normalization of laboratory parameters.
Subsequently, the patient continued to be followed up in consultations by the Cardiology Department, since as a sequel of endocarditis, she remained with severe aortic insufficiency that required surgical valve replacement (due to the change in the patient's functional class).
Final diagnosis Aortic stenosis on a native valve due to Gram-positive elegan
