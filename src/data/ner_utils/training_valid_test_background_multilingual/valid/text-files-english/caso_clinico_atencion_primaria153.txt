Consultation report A 31-year-old patient was referred to our Health Centre for a three-week history of spotting in the right eye.
A. Discussing the patient with mental illness.
No other relevant clinic.
Personal history approach: -No known drug-related diseases -No surgical interventions -Smoker of cigarettes at day 5 without treatment and normal self-reported normal self-medication, conscious, good self-medication.
Eupneic at rest.
No lymphadenopathy or jugular engorgement.
Otorhinolaryngological examination: pharynx without▁exudates or purulent plaques.
Bilateral otoscopy was normal.
Cardiorespiratory arrest: rhythmic, without murmurs.
Gallbladder mucus was preserved, with wheezing episodes occurring in both lung fields.
Abdomen: blando, no painful upon fixation.
No masses or organomegaly.
Murphy, Blumberg and Rovsing negative.
No defense.
Hydroaerial noises present
Lower limbs: no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Pedestriates, symmetrical
▁Complementary tests: -CAR: right paratracheal lymphadenopathies, in the pulmonary window and subcarinal area, and bilateral hiliar.
Alveolar opacities with air bronchogram, volume loss and distortion are observed in the pulmonary parenchyma, associated with centrilobular micronodular pattern, peribicular, thickened septal glass and thickened septal.
Small and few traction bronchiectasis.
No cystic lesions or peripheral panalization were observed.
There is no pleural effusion.
From all this it is concluded that the findings are compatible with sarcoidosis (alveolar form) stage 2.
Bronchoscopy: after analysis of the three transbronchial biopsies, Sarcoidosis was diagnosed.
Chest radiography: small opacities in both lung bases.
Parenchymal tracts and bronchiectasis in both bases, with bilateral perihilliar location.
Spirometry showed an obstructive pattern, with a FEV1/FVC ratio of around 63%, FEV1 of 59%, FVC of 93% and DLCO of 63%.
-Analytic: a slight hypercalcemia and elevation of the angiotensin converting enzyme were observed.
Rest without alterations.
Family and community approach The patient has adequate family and social support.
She lives near her relatives, with whom she has a close and solid relationship.
In addition, its use allows you to go to the corresponding reviews, without making any objection, which is an advantage in monitoring your condition.
On the other hand, it has a total health support (including both physicians who treat it as a nursing professional) so that, when faced with any new disposition of the disease, the patient has it.
Clinical judgement: Intermediate right eye examination.
-Sarcoidosis stage 2.
Plan of action and evolution The patient began with the clinic at 31 years.
She had no disease.
He smoked 5 cigarettes a day.
The symptom she consulted was a three-week history of a spot in her right eye.
After studying this, she was diagnosed with Pars planitis (this is an intermediate uveitis of unknown etiology).
In the ocular examination, visual acuity had not decreased in either eye.
Noteworthy is the posterior pole of the right eye, including the apex beat 2+, mild dermatitis, papilledema and snowbanks at a lower level less dense.
Macula unchanged.
Posterior pole of the left eye showed no alterations.
In addition, in the clinical interview, the patient reported dyspnea, both in▁crying and when climbing stairs.
At auscultation, the only thing to highlight was the presence of wheezing episodes, the rest being normal.
For this reason, a chest X-ray, a CT scan and a▁bronchoscopy were requested, with the results mentioned above.
The study was completed with an analytical, in which the only thing that stood out was the slightly elevated calcemia, since the rest (including viral serology and Mantoux) were negative.
It was extended with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, which was elevated.
Treatment was initiated with Prednisone 40mg and Omeprazole 20mg, with significant clinical improvement of dyspnea.
The CAT scan was repeated in 2013, and arrosary bronchiectasis was observed, grouped into upper and middle lung fields.
Adenopathies had decreased in size and number.
Regarding the ocular pathology, myodesopsias appeared in the right eye, as well as prepapillary fibrosis in the posterior pole of the eye, with peripheral vitreous condensation and snowballs at the lower level.
Currently, the cellular inflammatory reaction develops despite persistent peripheral arthritis.
In the last review, in January 2018, the patient had stopped smoking and reported no dyspnea on usual efforts.
Pulmonary auscultation is completely normal, with no pathological noises.
You are being treated with Prenisone 2.5 mg in a building block, Metrotex 2.5 mg (4 tablets a week), Plusvent 25/250 (two inhalations every 12 hours) and folinic acid weekly (see section 4.5).
