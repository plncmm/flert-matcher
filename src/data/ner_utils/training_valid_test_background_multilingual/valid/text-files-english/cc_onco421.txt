No drug allergies or toxic habits.
As a personal history, the patient has type III obesity (BMI 40), undergoing gastric reduction with good results, obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) treated with home CPAP in sleep and adjustment disorder since 2012.
She was operated on for right knee trauma.
In home treatment with escitalopram 20 mg/d and lorazepam 1 mg/d.
The patient came to the Ophthalmology Department because of an excretory conjunctival lesion with rapid growth in the right eye, having come several times to the Emergency Department during the previous month for pain and conjunctival erythema.
Physical examination of the right eye revealed a 4.5 x 4 mm, excrecent, coraliform, ulcerated and partially conjunctive covered lesion, which was hyperemic.
With an intraocular pressure of the right eye of 30 mm Hg.
Clear cornea, normal pupils.
Contralateral eye without findings.
No lymphadenopathies were detected.
▁Complementary tests A gonioscopy was performed by ophthalmology.
She was scheduled for surgical biopsy of the conjunctival lesion.
Bacteria culture and isolation of the same region were performed and HIV serology was extracted.
Gonioscopy showed no involvement of the iridocorneal angle.
Pathology of the surgical biopsy revealed fragments of▁keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.
Culture was positive for Alternaria and HIV serology was negative.
Diagnosis Epidermoid carcinoma of the conjunctival stage I (T1N0M0), without total involvement of an ocular quadrant.
Treatment The patient was scheduled for excision of the conjunctival lesion, and▁cryotherapy was given at the margins of the lesion at the time of surgery.
In the pathological anatomy of the surgical specimen, no involved borders (margin > 4 mm) or missing piece of sclera were observed.
Since the beginning of the consultations, the patient was treated with prednisone ophthalmic ointment 4 times/day and gentamicin ointment c/8 h. After the culture results, she was treated with voriconazole c/2 h.
The patient is referred to our consultations.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbital region was requested. An image of 10 x 4 x 7 mm with nodular, oval appearance and contrast-enhancement of the right lacrimal gland was observed.
We contacted Ophthalmology with information on MRI findings and maintained the patient under follow-up without systemic treatment at the present time.
