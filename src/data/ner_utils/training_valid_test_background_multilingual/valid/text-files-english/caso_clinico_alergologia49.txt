An 8-year-old girl with a history of rinitis and allergic asthma due to mites and cat epithelium was treated with inhaled budesonide and mite immunotherapy.
The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and bronchodilators for acute bronchitis.
One hour after administration of the prednisolone dose, the patient experienced dizziness,▁malaise, vomiting and urticaria unrelated to other triggering factors.
At the health center, she was treated with methylprednisolone and intramuscular antihistamines, showing an increase in urticarial lesions and general▁malaise.
Intramuscular injection was administered with clinical resolution in a few hours.
Results: Skin tests were performed on group A positive corticoids (prick positive to prednisolone and prednisone and positive intradermal reaction to hydrolytic agents plus methylprednisolone).
Skin tests for corticoids in group B (triammonium ranelate, metasone, betamethasone suspension) and group C (dexamethasone and betamethasone) were negative.
