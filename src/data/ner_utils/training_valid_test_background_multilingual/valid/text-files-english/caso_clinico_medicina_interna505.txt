A 20-year-old woman presented with bilateral parenchymal nephropathy, nephrocalcinosis and corticomedullary microcysts.
Among the personal history, we highlight moderate mental retardation, conduct disorder, hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome in treatment with allopurinol, statins and ACEI.
A pediatric report showed nephromegaly at birth, with normal renal function and sediment, but already hyperechogenic kidneys on ultrasound.
Among the family history, the maternal grandmother had chronic kidney disease.
In the anamnesis, the patient denies renoureteral colic, hematuria and ingestion of NSAIDs and has presented some uncomplicated UTI.
Physical examination is normal except for type I obesity.
In analytical stands out Cr 1.14 mg/dl with eGFR 69.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (already present in previous), hyperuricemia, hypomagnesemia, elevated GGT and urine sediment with >100.
The study was completed by recent urine (CAC 36 mg/g and CPC 0.130 g/g) and 24-h urine (acquirement proteinuria 540 mg/24h and urinary calcium citrate dialysate, TAhyper2+, urinary lithiasis, 25 mg/24h).
Abdominal CT ruled out lithiasis.
ERCG2A2 was suspected due to a probable chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (NTIC) due to persistent sterile pyuria.
A complete study was performed with Mantoux and serology to rule out infectious causes; proteinogram and light chain to rule out sarcoidosis resulting in normal chest X-ray and ANSD to rule out INT secondary to Sj√∂gre syndrome;
After ruling out other causes and in the face of family history, hyperuricemia, hypomagnesemia and bilateral microcystic--organisms, the diagnosis of tubulointermedullary nephropathy (NTID) is thought to be autosomal dominant causes
The genetic study confirms the diagnosis of microdeletion/microduplication syndrome 17q/12 of maternal origin with intellectual deficit and NTIAD by deletion of the HNF1B gene.
This syndrome is rare and is characterized by the presence of bilateral cortical renal cysts, renal hyperechogenicity in the fetal and neonatal period, hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia, altered liver function tests, pancreatic dysfunction type DM.
