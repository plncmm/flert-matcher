A 21-year-old woman with no personal history of interest came to the emergency department complaining of continuous and intense abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, non-irradiated, associated with fever (38.1oC).
The pain increased with respiratory movements, without relief after ingestion or bowel movements.
The physical examination revealed pain in the right upper quadrant, with no organomegaly or peritonitis, and absence of mucocutaneous jaundice.
Basic complementary tests included: CRP 148 mg/L, fervent and 61% deficiency of folic acid, GOT 56 IU/L and GGT 40 Ui/L, and coagulation disorders with prothrombin activity.
Persistent abdominal pain, fever and laboratory findings were consistent. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and CT scan of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly, a large amount of free periheptic fluid and pelvis, as well as a complicated IMCI intensity.
After assessment by radiology and general surgery, it was concluded that there was no acute abdominal pathology that could be considered as a source of emergency surgery or PPE criteria.
She was admitted to internal medicine to start a diagnostic process, a priori suggesting inflammatory bowel disease versus abdominal infectious pathology.
All tests performed during admission were negative, including: magnetic resonance enterography, with step-by-step biopsies, as well as multiple serology (CMV, ESR, HBV, HCV, HBV and microbiological study).
The culture of vaginal‚ñÅexudate for Gardenella, Trichomona and Gonococo was also negative.
Finally we saw light at the end of the tunnel with positive serology IgG and IgM for Chlamydia trachomatis that, along with clinical and imaging tests, were highly suggestive of Fitz-hepat conscious-Cur syndrome.
Treatment with Doxi 100mg/12h was established for 14 days with complete resolution of the clinical picture that led to admission.
