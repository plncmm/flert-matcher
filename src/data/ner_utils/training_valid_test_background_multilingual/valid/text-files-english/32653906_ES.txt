15 years old with frontal headache with retroorbital pain, fever and intense sweating.
On May 5, the patient reported emetic episodes, weakness and pain in the lower extremities, which progressed to upper extremities.
On May 8, with no history of surgery or hospitalization and no recent vaccination, he was admitted to a local pediatric hospital.
A rapid COVID-19 test was positive for IgG and IgM.
The initial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses (cytometry, biochemistry) and aerobic CSF cultures performed at admission revealed no abnormalities.
The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone, azole, and after 3 days, treated at the COVID referral hospital in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.
Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was in good general condition, with no respiratory symptoms.
Neurological examination showed normal consciousness and speech, normal activity of the cranial nerves, progressive symmetric weakness of the extremities (medical Research Council score 3/5 for the upper limbs and 2/5 for the lower limbs), absence of sensory symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal swabs tested by PCR were negative for influenza and positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Another cytometric and biochemical analysis of CSF, about 2 weeks after nonspecific initial symptoms, yielded results within normal parameters.
CSF PCR was negative for the most common viruses (herpes 1, herpes 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-acquired SA.RS-CoVster, zika, dengue and chikungunya), as well as-2
A thoracic and cranial CT scan and a thoracic, cranial and lumbar MRI did not reveal abnormalities.
Blood tests with complete blood count, serum glucose, C-reactive protein, electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
Serology for hepatitis B and C, HIV and tests for venereal diseases were negative.
An electroneurogram revealed normal sensory action potentials, although with a large reduction in the amplitude of action potentials in all motor nerves studied, with relatively preserved conduction velocities.
F waves were absent in all nerves studied.
These abnormalities are compatible with acute motor axonal neuropathy of GBS.
Given the patient's clinical history of progressive symmetrical weakness, supported by electroneurogram results, recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR, negative microbiological results for other causes in CSF and MRI were diagnosed.
On May 15, the patient started treatment with 400 mg/kg/day of IV immunoglobulin.
on a 5-day schedule.
Despite some improvement after IG therapy, weakness in the upper and lower limbs persisted and, at this time, the patient is in physiotherapy.
