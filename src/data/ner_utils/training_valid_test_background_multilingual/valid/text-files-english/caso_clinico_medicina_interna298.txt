A 73-year-old woman with stage 3 CRE, this history of lithiasis and chronic atrophic gastritis, who underwent surgery in 2016 for ascending aortic aneurysm with placement of an aortic prosthesis in 2016, was referred due to a constitutional condition with loss of about 15 kg.
Analytically, the patient had progressive anemia and impaired renal function.
She had previously undergone a TAC non-pelvic junction, and gastroscopy without pathological findings.
During admission, mild hypergammaglobulinemia was observed with low titers of ANA positive without antigen specificity.
Rectal biopsy is negative for amyloidosis.
Echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound and PET-CT were performed without significant findings.
Blood cultures, viral serology and quantiferon were requested and negative.
Since admission acute deterioration of renal function associated with proteinuria in non-nephrotic range, it was decided to perform renal biopsy and hemodialysis was initiated, with poor tolerance to sessions for fever peaks with hemodynamic deterioration.
In addition, the patient developed respiratory failure, with the appearance of dry biphasic crackles and bilateral interstitial-alveolar pattern on X-ray.
A chest CT scan was requested, showing a patchy pattern in the middle and upper fields.
BAL was performed with negative mycobacterial PCR and transbronchial lung biopsy.
Finally renal biopsy was reported as non necrotizing granulomatous interstitial nephritis.
Later granulomas and giant multinucleated cells were also detected in lung biopsy.
Systemic granulomatous disease requires ACE that is decreased in blood and hemocultives directed to mycobacteria are requested.
It was decided to initiate corticoids and, despite the negativity of PCR for mycobacterium, empirical tuberculous infections were initiated due to a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated.
Days later, it was isolated in hemocultives of Mycobacterium chimaera, so antibiotic therapy was adjusted to antibiogram.
The fever and respiratory failure disappeared within the following weeks, and haemodialysis was continued due to established renal damage.
Mycobacteria chimaera was associated in 2012 with infection in patients with previous cardiac surgery.
It is in the thermal control system of cardiopulmonary bypass and is transmitted by aerosolization.
The lack of specificity of the clinic, the long latency period and the difficulty of obtaining its isolation and characterization by specific microbiological techniques, lead to a significant diagnostic delay that leads to high mortality.
