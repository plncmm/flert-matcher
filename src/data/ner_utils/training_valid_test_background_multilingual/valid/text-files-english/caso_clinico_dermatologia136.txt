Anamnesis A 15-year-old patient who came to our clinic for evaluation of two lesions, located in both upper limbs, of one month of evolution.
The patient had already been evaluated for these same lesions, with the diagnosis of arthropod bite lesions with superinfection, so he was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and topical corticoid, with resolution.
The patient reports fluctuations in the severity of the lesions, with a subjective perception of improvement after infliximab infusions.
He denied general▁malaise, fever, or other systemic symptoms.
Do not travel abroad, do not contact animals, denie handling animals.
It lives in a population of southern Madrid.
As a personal history, the patient was diagnosed with non-bacterial osteitis affecting mainly the pelvis for four years, with the development of psoriasis two years ago.
She is being treated with infliximab every six weeks for 20 mg daily.
Physical examination revealed two ulcerated lesions: right forearm ulcer, erythematous blistering ulcer, perilesional erythematous halo.
The lesions were infiltrated with a diameter of 17 x 14 mm.
Left-sided smoke presents a smaller lesion, 12 x 10 mm, with characteristics similar to the first lesion, covered by a mosaicism pattern.
There are no other lesions on the skin examination.
▁Complementary diagnosis required two biopsies of the larger lesion to arrive at a conclusive diagnosis.
Histopathological and microbiological analysis was performed in both cases.
Blood tests were performed with different determinations, including serology and culture of▁parasites in blood.
Diagnosis The pathology of the first biopsy showed multiple non-necrotizing granulomatous formations consisting of epithelioid cells with▁lymphocytic corona and giant multinuclear cells.
No microorganisms were identified using PAS, Gro and Ziehl techniques.
The second biopsy showed a dense polymorphous▁lymphocytic infiltrate with abundant histiocytic aggregates of granulomatous aspect.
The infiltrate was also accompanied by abundant cellular detritus.
PCR of the biopsied tissue was positive for Leishmania infantum.
Serologies were positive for Leishmania genus.
The detection of leishmania antigens in blood and urine by PCR was negative.
The diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis was therefore established.
Treatment The patient began treatment with intralesional tapering of 1500 mg/5 ml, divided between the two lesions.
The patient received seven doses prescribed,▁totaling three weeks.
Before and during the treatment, successive analytical tests were performed with liver, kidney and kidney profiles, without presenting relevant changes in these parameters.
The electrocardiogram tracing was monitored and showed no changes during treatment.
The patient experienced dysthermia during the hours following the injections, which was treated with paracetamol 600 mg. After receiving blood clotting seven doses, the patient presented complete resolution of the cutaneous symptoms and persistence of antigen negativity in the detection of Leishmania.
