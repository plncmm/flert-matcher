Clinical history.
Anamnesis A 34-year-old male patient of Bulgarian origin with a history of hepatitis C and ex-cocaine user for 4 years.
She presented with a five-day history of chest pain of pleuritic characteristics and dyspnea, accompanied by fever (the last two days) and pain in the left lower limb.
Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs and chest CT were performed, which provided the diagnosis of DVT in IIM bilateral vasculitis and cavitated pulmonary nodules suggestive of septic embolism as the first etiological option without ruling out any possibility.
Based on the above, admission to the ICU was decided.
After clinical stabilization, she was transferred to Internal Medicine.
During his stay in the plant, he presented a pustulous acute exanthema of predominant trunk and upper limbs associated with fever and leukocytosis.
Samples were taken for biopsy and culture when evaluated in conjunction with▁dermatology.
