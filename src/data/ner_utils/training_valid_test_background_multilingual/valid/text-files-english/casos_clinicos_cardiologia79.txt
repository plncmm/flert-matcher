ANESTH AND ADMINISTRTATIVE ANESTHESIC AREASING A 56-year-old male, without known allergies, with a history of hypertension, moderate obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Professional, bus driver.
She came to the emergency room with a single episode of oppressive centrothoracic pain, which caused her to suffer from constipation at night approximately one hour later, with a non-irradiated evolution, without associated symptoms, syncope.
Chest pain during hospitalization in the emergency department after starting intravenous infusion of solinitrine and blood pressure control.
On his arrival he is in good general condition.
Constant measurements showed blood pressure of 200/121 mmHg, heart rate of 83 beats per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% at room air.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation and other physical examination are normal.
A patient with an episode of chest pain at rest and elevated troponin in the context of very high blood pressure levels was admitted to Cardiology with the initial diagnosis of hypertensive emergency.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES ECG at admission: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm.
narrow QRS.
Q in III and VF with ST elevation less than 1mm.
V3-V6 and negative T in aVL.
Poor progression of R in precordial leads.
There were no serial ECG changes, all of them without pain.
Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation were normal.
Markers of slightly elevated myocardial necrosis (maximum TnT US 16 ng/ml being the limit 14, without typical curve of acute coronary syndrome).
Chest radiography: cardiomegaly.
Aortic lengthening.
Thickening hiliar.
Transthoracic echocardiography: left ventricle not dilated with moderate concentric hypertrophy (14-14 mm), without changes in segmental▁contractility.
Dilatation of the ascending aorta.
Stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with diodemol: hypertensive heart disease with normal LVEF.
Absence of inducible ischemia or myocardial necrosis.
The image showed slight thickening of the thoracic aorta at the ascending and descending levels, compatible with intramural hematoma.
Angio-CT: intramural hematoma affecting the aortic arch and extending to the descending thoracic aorta without reaching the abdominal aorta is observed.
No penetrating ulcer images or signs of dissection were identified.
Aneurysmal dilatations were not observed.
Aortic remnant without significant findings.
Central laboratory: urea 38 mg/dl, creatinine 0.88 mg/dl, direct leukocytes ̄ platelets 10.6 mg/dl, sodium 139 mmol/l, potassium 4.4 mmol/l, chlorine 102 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol 1dl 44 μdl
EVOLUTION During his stay in the cardiology ward, the patient remains clinically stable and asymptomatic, without new episodes of chest pain, with good control of blood pressure levels under treatment with beta-blockers, oral nitrates and ACEI.
After performing a transthoracic echocardiogram on the first day of hospital admission, and in the presence of dilation of the ascending aorta, a stress magnetic resonance imaging with dismissible dynamism was requested to evaluate the aorta and acute aortic syndrome as well as heart disease.
After the diagnosis of intramural hematoma with imaging tests, successive angio-CTs are performed for evolutionary assessment, since the patient remains clinically stable.
Due to the absence of hematoma growth in imaging tests and as the ascending aorta is not compromised, it was decided to perform an expectant treatment, with hospital discharge and follow-up preferably in outpatient cardiovascular surgery.
Twenty-five days after discharge, the patient came back to the emergency room for a new episode of sudden and intense pain in the lumbar region accompanied by paresthesia in the right lower limb.
On physical examination, the absence of bilateral femoral pulses was highlighted.
Emergency CT angiography was performed aiming at type A dissection extending from the ascending aorta to both iliacs, as well as false lumen thrombosis in the ascending aorta, highlighting the significant increase in the diameter of the ascending aorta compared to the previous study.
These findings led to an urgent surgical intervention.
During the surgical procedure, the entrance door at the level of the ascending aorta was not closed or collapsed. A type B dissection was finally diagnosed, with progression of an ascending aorta by a 32 mm graft.
Subsequently, the patient presents a torpid evolution during his stay in the ICU requiring immediate vasoactive drugs and daily voiding in the postoperative period.
After clinical stabilization, the patient was extubated and discharged from the intensive care unit.
During his stay in the ward, the patient was discharged properly without further complications and was referred to outpatient follow-up appointments with a rehabilitation program.
Currently, 3 months after admission due to hypertensive emergency, the patient is clinically stable.
DIAGNOSIS In the cardiac resonance, which was negative for ischemia, an image compatible with intramural hematoma in the thoracic aorta is observed, without affecting the ascending aorta, so the findings previously described are requested CT angiography confirming the diagnosis.
