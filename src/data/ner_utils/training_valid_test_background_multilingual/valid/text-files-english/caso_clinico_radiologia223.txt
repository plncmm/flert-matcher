A 37-year-old Asian male presented to the emergency department with syncope with spontaneous recovery and residual confusion.
Cranial CT performed only showed a small right parietal subcortical hypodensity, without cortical involvement, suggestive of vasogenic edema.
Interrogating from the patient, he reported a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis two years ago in another center, without microbiological isolation and poor adherence to treatment.
The findings were confirmed by urgent MRI, which identified a small rounded lesion with ring-enhancement within the vasogenic edema described, compatible with tuberculoma.
No diffusion restriction or signs of hemorrhage were observed in magnetic susceptibility sequences.
Suspicion was confirmed by pathological adenopathy-clavicular biopsy with positive result for mycosis supra.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative.
