23 years old, Chilean, with a history of travel for work reasons to plant vegetables and bananas, to the rural sector of São Paulo (woman Turbo), Brazil, for a period of 8 months.
The patient had a history of 1 month and a half of evolution with an increase in erythematous volume located in the left dorsolumbar region associated with intermittent stabbing pain.
Physical examination revealed an erythematous nodular lesion with a central hole and seropurulent▁exudate.
Erythematosus nodule of approximately 3 cm in diameter with central orifice and▁exudate located in the left dorsolumbar region.
The patient noticed the spontaneous exit of a larva through the orifice of the lesion.
Stage III larva identified as cryptic hominis.
The larva was brownish colored, approximately 2 cm long, and presented several small rows of black people with an anteroposterior arrangement in their extremes.
Larva was identified as erythematous hominis, stage III.
Due to the clinical and epidemiological context and morphological characteristics of the larvae, a diagnosis of myiasis forum hominis was established.
Treatment with oral flucloxacillin, 500 mg every 8 h for 7 days was indicated, considering the presence of erythema, pain and exudation.
The patient came to follow-up 1 week later, with excellent evolution, without signs of infection and only post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Interestingly, hominis has a biological cycle: the species needs to develop its larvae in a hot-blooded host (mammifera and accidentally man), constituting a myiasis obligatorily.
Because the fly is not a pest, it deposits its eggs in the abdomen of arthropods (mosquitoses).
