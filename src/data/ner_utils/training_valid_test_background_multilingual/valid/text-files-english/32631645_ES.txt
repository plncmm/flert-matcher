Two of their three young carers had started with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, so we performed PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in this patient because it was the most vulnerable and susceptible to transfer to a good social-healthcare center.
The PCR in nasopharyngeal▁exudate was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on April 1, 2020.
Preceding the suggestive family companion in relation to the symptoms, the children inform us that our patient only had a fever (maximum temperature 37.5°C) on March 23, 2020, without any other respiratory infection
Home isolation measures were indicated; initiating treatment with methotrexate for every second week; outpatient monitoring of the patient was performed, so that telephone interviews were conducted with caregivers every 48 hours the first 24 hours after diagnosis.
