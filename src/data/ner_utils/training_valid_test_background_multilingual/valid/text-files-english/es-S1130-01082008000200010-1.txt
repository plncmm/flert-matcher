A 74-year-old female patient was admitted with a 2-week history of diffuse abdominal pain, hypoxia and asthenia.
She had been vomiting in coffee grounds and melenaic stools for 2 days.
His personal history included hypertension treated with amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide and dyslipidemia that controlled with lovastatin.
He was not a smoker and denied taking NSAIDs, alcohol or oral contraceptives.
Her family history was: deceased mother of gastric cancer, brother with liver cirrhosis of unknown etiology and sister with hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Physical restraint: hemodynamic stability.
Diffuse abdominal pain or tenderness without signs of peritonitis.
- Analytical at admission: haemoglobin: 13.5 mg/dl; hematocrit:▁37.6%; platelets: 120,000/ml; bilirubin: 247 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase: 220 amino acid transferase: 59 IU/dl
An emergency gastroscopy showed medium size esophageal varices without warning signs of imminent bleeding [F2 RC(-) according to the classification of the Japones Society for multiple duodenal erosions and fibrin for the recent study of hemostasis.
On computed tomography and abdominal ultrasound, the liver was of normal size, with slightly undulating edges with a slightly heterogeneous parenchyma, without space occupying lesions.
The patient also presented enlarged spleen, ascites and small left pleural effusion.
On the other hand, there was a complete nonsteroidal portal vein thrombosis at the level of the hepatic hilium and its branches, as well as another thrombus at the level of the superior venaplhep and the presence of collateral circulation in the gastro ligaments
The etiological study of the different causes of chronic liver disease included: hepatotropic virus (HBV, HCV) and HIV, study of autoimmunity, ceruloplasmin, ferritin and all urine porphyrins.
Subsequently, a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed with hemodynamic study showing a portal pressure gradient of 12 mmHg with normal phlebography.
The biopsy showed an alteration of the hepatic architecture due to hepatocyte hyperplasia in zone 1 of some of the assemblages, with a tendency to be nodular but without perineum fibrosis septa.
Portal tracts showed the usual duct-to-vena triad, although the vein was sometimes poorly patent and a paraportal vein was observed.
They presented mild fibrous expansion and contained mild▁lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate with focal overflow by the periportal interface.
In the lobule, there was also some inflammatory focus, although there were no acidophilic bodies or other relevant findings.
These fibrotic changes rule out mild nodular hyperplasia, irregular nodular hyperplasia and the absence of perinodular fibrosis rule out cirrhosis and are compatible with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.
The possibility that all liver changes were secondary to a primary portal vein thrombosis was studied for hypercoagulability.
This study showed an antigenic free S protein (pS), total antigenic pS and anticoagulant free pS of 56, 107 and 44% respectively, which was suggestive of a coagulation factor S homocardiolipin II homocardioin antibody range.
This result was confirmed in a subsequent control.
The patient was started on anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol and diuretics indefinitely.
No new indications of sedation were found during follow-up.
