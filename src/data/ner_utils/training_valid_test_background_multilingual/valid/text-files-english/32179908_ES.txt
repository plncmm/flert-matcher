A 55-day-old girl, otherwise healthy, with mixed lactation, became sick with rhinorrhea and dry cough on January 28, 2020.
He was admitted to our hospital on February 2, 2020.
Before the onset of symptoms, between January 16 and 24, her parents had taken her to Lu"an (province of Hubei) for a family party.
At that party the uncle and aunt of the girl, living in Wuhan, had cough and fever.
On January 31, 2020, the child's parents were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on her symptoms, chest X-rays and nucleic acid tests of pharyngeal smears.
The nasopharyngeal swab obtained from the child was also positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a real-time RT-PCR.
On admission, physical examination showed that vital signs were normal except for pharyngeal hyperemia.
A chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities in the right lung.
Analytical tests indicated alterations in liver functional capacity values and a slightly abnormal myocardial cystogram.
Lymphocyte count, thrombocyte count, CD8+ T lymphocyte count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M value were slightly elevated.
Other laboratory tests of the patient showed no alterations, such as hemoglobin, impaired renal function, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
Tests for rotavirus in▁faeces and for cytomegalovirus in blood were negative.
Based on the clear history of contact and previous results, the child was diagnosed with COVID-19 (normal type).
Amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate (30 mg/kg, every 8 hours, iv glucose tolerance test) was isolated and empirically treated with inhaled interferon α-1b (15μg, twice daily).
), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid and the traditional Chinese loto qing .
On days 2 to 6 of hospitalization (days 7 to 11 of the disease), the patient worsened, presenting frequent cough and occasional tachycardia (150-170 l.p.).
On the morning of the fourth day of hospitalization, a decrease in arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2 lower: 56 mmHg) was observed with high lactic acid values when breathing room air.
Sputum aspiration was applied.
Meanwhile, oxygen was given immediately through a nasal cannula and ambroxol was administered to remove the phlegm.
As a tendency to worsening was observed, a second chest CT was performed on the night of the fourth day of hospitalization (day 9 of disease), which showed evidence of progression of pneumonia.
Coagulase deficiency resulted in worsening of respiratory status.
Abnormal myocardial scintigraphy at admission and increased troponin I (25 μg per litre) on the fourth day of hospitalization indicated myocardial lesions, so that sodium phosphocreatine was administered.
protect your heart.
During this period, the child continued to have good appetite and did not develop diarrhea, oliguria or shock.
On day 11 of the disease, a stool sample was collected for the first time to detect viral RNA; the PCR result was positive.
On days 7 to 12 of hospitalization (days 12 to 17 of disease), the patient's clinical condition gradually improved and respiratory symptoms disappeared on day 11 of hospitalization.
Oxygen therapy was withdrawn and saturation values were 94% to 100% with room air.
▁Pulse was maintained between 120 and 140 l.p.m.
Analytical tests on day 10 of hospitalization showed that myocardial scintigraphy and liver functional capacity had been restored to normal values.
On day 11 of hospitalization (day 16 of disease), a third chest CT clearly showed that patchy shadows and ground glass opacities had been absorbed.
Based on the clinical picture of the patient and other analytical tests, Citrobacter freundii found in two sputum cultures was considered a colonizing bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not treated.
Three pharyngeal swabs obtained on hospital days 10-13 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-PCR tests.
Amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate was removed on day 11 of hospitalization and the next day, interferon α-1b was removed.
According to the latest provisional directives on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China, the patient met the criteria for discharge.
However, we found that anal swabs collected on days 11 and 13 of hospitalization were still positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Consequently, the patient was hospitalized.
From February 16, 2020, the patient was transferred to another hospital for isolation and observation.
In the manuscript review process, we have known that the patient remained asymptomatic during this period and that anal swabs were negative on February 28, 2020 for this viral RNA.
With respect to the mother of the patient, we have known that viral RNA was detected in stool samples from the mother on February 4, 2020 (day 8 of disease) and in 11 2020 anal swabs from February 7, 2020.
In addition, three consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests in breast milk were negative between February 2 and 4 of 2020.
The mother's urine samples, collected on February 6, 2020, were also negative for SARS-CoV-2.
