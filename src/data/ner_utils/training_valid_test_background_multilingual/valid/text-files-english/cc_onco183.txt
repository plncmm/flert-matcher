A 34-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of suprapubic abdominal pain.
No family history.
Pathological history: smoker IA 10 pack/year.
Don't drink.
FUR: 6/1/2014.
No known drug allergies.
Establishment plan 1.
Head and neck: no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.
CA: rhythmic, no murmurs.
AP: conserved vesicular murmur, no overwhelmed noises.
Abdomen: blando, depresible, non-painful to palpation, surgical wound of laparotomy in good condition.
Lower limbs: no edema.
▁Complementary tests » IQ was performed on the 24/2/2013a papillary tumor o in the left vario of 10 cm, left adnexectomy and tumor was performed, with pathological result of limited cystadenocarcinoma serous.
» After the findings, a CT-TAP was performed with solid lung mass with areas hypodense at the spiculated level of the LSD spiculated 5 x 3 cm, right adrenal mass of 3 cm, retroperitoneal space stenosis.
» Given the possibility of synchronous tumor, it is evaluated by▁Pneumology, performing on December 31, 2013, a▁bronchoscopy, in which an endobronchial lesion is observed at the LSD level.
» Biopsies were taken, with a positive result for calcitonin thyroid carcinoma and poorly differentiated▁immunohistochemical profile compatible with lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 +, p63 negative, CK56▁keratin: negative, CEA, large).
» PET-CT is performed, where areas of hypercaptation are observed at the level of LSD, cutaneous, ganglion, bone, subcutaneous and right adrenal, with the diagnosis of ovarian cystadenocarcinoma E physician consultation and adenocarcinoma
» EGFR and ALK are requested (negative result) and biopsies of the SC nodule are performed, resulting in cutaneous metastases from moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.
» Given the results, thyroid ultrasound was requested, finding in the right hemithyroid an irregular poorly defined area of 1.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm, as well as adenopathies in the contralateral jugular-carotid chain.
Calcitonin: 776.
» Given the diagnostic doubt, thyroid biopsy was requested, resulting in medullary thyroid carcinoma.
Due to adrenal involvement, pheochromocytoma is suspected and catecosystems in blood and urine are requested, which are positive.
PTH: normal.
« Protoon▁integrén RET: de novo mutation gen RET.
Diagnosis » Metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma.
« Sickle cell of pheochromocytoma in relation to MEN 2B syndrome.
» Ovarian cystadenocarcinoma and HF.
Treatment With the probable medullary result of thyroid disease, treatment with vandetanib 300 mg/24 h was initiated. The patient came to control one month later, with improvement of her functional status and reduction of subcutaneous nodules.
In the March control, an increase in the abdominal▁perimeter and lumbar pain was observed, so a MR was performed, where a horsetail syndrome was observed. CI to RT was performed under treatment with 30 Gy.
Given the suspicion of progression, 1,455 CT scans of the ovary-TAP level showed progression of the disease with increased bilateral supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, increased pulmonary nodules, increased right adrenal mass and appearance of a left adrenal mass (776).
Given the diagnostic doubt and the progression of the disease to vandetanib (first line in the medullary thyroid gland), we present the case in an Ongo session and we decided to start treatment with primary line + taxol.
The patient received three cycles of TCastaxol metastasis and in the evaluation of response to disease progression there was an increase in supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, increased right lung mass and left adnexal mass.
Since the tumor has neuroendocrine features and the poor response to vandetanib, in March 2014, treatment with gemcitabine + 80% irinotean was initiated.
The patient received treatment for three cycles, and on 7/7/2014, CT evaluation showed a decrease in supraclavicular soft adenopathy, decrease in cutaneous metastases, decrease in bilateral adenopelvic mass in the right suprarenal space.
On July 18, 2014, the patient was admitted for a febrile syndrome and bilateral multiple brain metastases, receiving holocraneal TDR.
Patient with medullary thyroid carcinoma and adrenal involvement.
First-line treatment with vandetanib was started with progression after three cycles.
It is changed to a QT line of unknown origin, with new progression.
A third line of treatment is initiated with gemcitabine + CPT 11, with response after three cycles and progression at CNS level.
She was admitted on August 26, 2014 for neurological deterioration, and died during hospitalization.
Necropsy is requested, but the family does not want it.
