A 68-year-old male with type II diabetes and cirrhosis due to HCV was admitted for elective surgery for urinary bladder adenocarcinoma.
The immediate postoperative period was peritonitis secondary to surgical wound infection and acute renal failure, with progressive clinical improvement.
Two weeks later, the patient presented clinical worsening with signs of septic shock.
A portable abdominal X-ray was performed, which identified a linear radiolucent image in the right hypochondrium suggestive of corresponding intramural gas in the gallbladder wall.
The CT scan was extended to rule out pelvic perforation and intra-abdominal abscesses.
The images show a gallbladder distended with intramural gas in fundus and abundant intramural gas with extension of the bubbles to adjacent fatty tissues, showing continuity solution in the infundibular region medial trabecular free fat,
The findings are consistent with emphysematous emphysematous‚ñÅpolyposis.
