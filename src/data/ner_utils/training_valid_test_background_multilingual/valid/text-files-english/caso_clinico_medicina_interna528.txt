A 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, peripheral arteriopathy, atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis who required transcatheter aortic valve implantation for one year.
She was admitted to Internal Medicine due to a constitutional syndrome of 11 months duration, shortly after TAVI implantation, with hypoxia and loss of 33Kg.
The patient presented severe asthenia, generalized arthromyalgia, worsening of her habitual dyspnea and ortopnea with reduced diuresis rhythm.
The physical examination revealed significant cachexia and the presence of a pansystolic rude▁polypal murmur.
In the lower limbs, he presented non-enhanced purpuric lesions, with a "calcetin" distribution.
Initially, a general laboratory analysis showed normochromic normocytic hemoglobin 10"9 g/Dl, leukocytosis with left shift, CRP 224 mg/L, ESR 101 mm/h, BNP 1,618 pg/mL and mild renal failure
Consecutively, electrocardiogram, venous gas, systematic urine x-ray and chest X-ray were performed without relevant findings.
During her hospital stay, a body-TAC was performed without contrast (due to renal failure) with a splenic infarction of 5"8cm.
In addition, hemocultives were extracted and repeatedly positive for Staphylococcus epidermis meticilin-resistant.
Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was also performed, which showed diffuse thickening (7mm) of the mitral-aortic fibrous tissue with image of dissection of the fibrosa, which conditioned the onset of severe mitral regurgitation.
Once the antibiotic was identified, the patient met Dukes criteria (2 major + 3 minor), finally being diagnosed with Endogenous Resuscitation Ambulatory by TAVI over a susceptible S. epimycin treatment was initiated.
