Anamnesis This is a 37-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia and medullary aplasia.
She had recently been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a long period due to sepsis caused by Serratia.
Consultation was scheduled after▁awakening from the coma, with decreased bilateral visual acuity (VA), more pronounced in the right eye (OD).
▁Complementary tests and screening: The patient was in a bad general condition, was somewhat afflicted and did not collaborate very well in the exploration.
The VA in the RE was 0.1 difficult and in the left eye (LE) 0.5-0.6.
The ocular pressure was 15 mmHg in both eyes.
The anterior segment biomycosis showed no interesting findings.
The absence of cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes was verified.
On examination of the eye fundus (FO) of the right eye, severe colitis and a whitish overlying macular lesion of three papillary areas▁surrounded by a hemorrhagic halo were observed.
In the OI FO was observed the presence of low vitreous cellularity and macular lesion similar to the OD.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the RE showed a poor quality signal due to vitreous opacity.
OCT of the left eye showed a raised lesion with internal reflectivity and medial retinal hyporesponsiveness in the outer retina, which we considered a phenomenon of posterior interpretation.
Differential diagnosis and management of these lesions in a patient with a history of severe macular disease, sepsis and long-term admission to the ICU were discussed. • This could be a bilateral relapse of acute myeloid leukemia.
• Bilateral macular haemorrhage and vitreous haemorrhage (something haemolysed) associated with bone marrow aplasia could have occurred.
• Finally, we raise the possibility that it was an endogenous endophthalmitis with bilateral macular involvement, possibly due to Serratia, which was the causal agent of sepsis that suffered, or perhaps due to a long period of intravenouscatheter infection,
At that time, we requested blood tests and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with gadolinium of the brain and orbits, and perform diagnostic pars plana resection (PPV) 23 G.
We consulted the Hematology Department, which ruled out the possibility of performing a bone marrow biopsy due to the patient's poor general condition.
However, they performed a lumbar puncture.
RESULTS The vitreous culture was negative for bacteria and bacteria.
Anatomopathological, cytological and▁immunohistochemical analyses were negative for malignancy.
Only the presence of syphilis was detected.
Blood test results did not provide any data of interest.
Pancytitis was detected, a finding that was already known.
Lumbar puncture did not support a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia.
Brain and orbital MRI showed no significant findings.
EVOLUTION Given the results, we observed a favorable expectant attitude and evolution.
After several weeks, bilateral spontaneous resolution was observed.
OD OCT showed thickening of the internal limiting membrane detachment in the foveal area.
We believe this is a case of bilateral macular haemorrhage associated with vitreous haemorrhage in a critically ill patient with pancytopenia.
