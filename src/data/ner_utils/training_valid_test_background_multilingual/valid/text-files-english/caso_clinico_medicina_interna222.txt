A 73-year-old male patient with hypertension, pulmonary emphysema type, left atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal in treatment with sintrom, thrombocytopenia and polycythemia in follow-up by Hematology and multiple hemispheric infarctions
She came to Internal Medicine consultation for two years presenting hemorrhagic macule-like lesions in both▁ears in addition to ecchymosis in 2nd and 3rd fingers of MID.
Biopsy of one of the macular lesions was performed, resulting in mild histological acroangioderma.
We requested a new biopsy of the ecchymotic lesion this time, with result of classical variant Kaposi's sarcoma with positive immunostaining for Human Herpes Virus type 8 (HHHV8).
HIV, HCV, HBV and Lúes: negative.
Serology VHH8: positive 1/640.
Echo-Doppler MMII: absence of deep venous thrombosis.
CT-thorax and abdomen: signs of chronic bronchopathy, rest, normal.
Pathological diagnosis was established and treatment with Difenciprone was initiated with partial response, without disappearance of the skin lesions.
The decision was made to refer the patient to an Ongoing treatment with liposomal doxorubicin, which resulted in significant improvement of the lesions, but without complete disappearance.
Kaposi's sarcoma is a multifocal systemic disease with predominantly cutaneous involvement, consisting of a proliferation of endothelial cells and related to HVH8 infection.
Classical Kaposi's sarcoma is a slow course variant that appears in adults aged 60 years or older as one or multiple macules or▁papules, soft, red-blue, purple, or centigrade nodules.
Regardless of the clinical stage, intranuclear expression of VHH8 is detected.
Massive lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma should be differentiated from microvenular hemangioma, benign lymphangiomatosis and well-differentiated angiosarcoma.
In advanced stages, distinguishing from acroangioderma, pseudosarcoma of Kaposi and erythematum diutinum.
Complete resolution is practically impossible, given the high risk of recurrence.
In immunocompetent patients with classic Kaposi's sarcoma, expectant management is an accepted option.
Surgical removal is reserved for single and accessible lesions.
Radiation therapy is used in the multiple but relatively localized forms, and in the rapidly progressive forms or with systemic involvement, chemotherapy.
