Consultation address A 42-year-old woman was referred by her primary care physician for anaemia.
Personal Background Non-drug allergies, no cardiovascular risk factors, no toxic habits.
Medical history: Primary hypothyroidism; Hyatal hernia; Left retrobulbar optic neuritis (with total amaurosis in left eye.
It was diagnosed a year ago.
Autoimmune optic neurmyelitis non-affiliated).
Surgery: cholecystectomy in 2008; placement of a stent.
Baseline life: Natural Peru.
The patient has been living in Spain for 7 years.
Last trip to Peru 4 years ago, no trip to other countries.
Usual treatment: Prednisone: was discontinued two months earlier.
Azathioprine: 50 mg/8 hours (previously up to 2 months ago: 50 mg/day); Gaba: 600 mg/8 hours; ethylthyroxine: 75 mcg/ day.
Current disease The patient complained of asthenia and increased abdominal▁perimeter of 2 months duration.
In addition, in recent days, fever of 38o C, headache and pain in the right hemiabdomen.
It provides an analytical performed by his primary care physician (1 month before) highlighting bicit (Hb 9.4 g/dL, leukocytes 1800, neutrophils 500, platelets 200,000/mm3).
Without contact with animals, take NSAIDs or herbal products.
There were no other symptoms in the directed anamnesis.
As the only remarkable history, she was treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine 50 mg/day for a year.
The patient consulted a private neurologist for a second opinion about amaurosis three months ago, despite being clinically stable, who increased the dose of azathioprine to 150 mg/day and progressive discontinuation of corticosteroids.
Physical location AT: 115/58 mm Hg, HR: 103 bpm, Ta: 38oC.
Good general condition.
Good mucous-cutaneous color.
Non-constitutionary.
No respiratory work.
Head and Neck: unchanged.
Cardiopulmonary arrest: unchanged.
Abdomen: blushing and depressible, giant hepatomegaly, mildly painful signs of negative consistency, without irritation Mubergphy, abdominal masses, ascites in peritoneal flakes; RHA;
The lower limbs were normal.
Neurological: no meningeal signs, no other focality.
▁Complementary tests in the emergency room: Blood analysis: Hb 5.8 g/dL, Hto 16%, MCV 108.7, MCH 39.3, ADE 29.9 %, platelets 49,000/uL, leukocytes 2.200/ %)
1.14, fibrinogen 639 mg/dL, bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, CRP 6.6 mg/dL.
The rest of the biochemistry was normal.
Basic urine analysis: Bilirubin +, Urobilinogen >=8.0 mg/dL, normal rest; Chest X-ray: clamping of both costophrenic sinuses.
Abdominal CT: patchy hypodensity suggesting hepatic fat mass; liver vascular structures permeability; LOEs are not identified; portal hyperdense (repermeabilization of hepatic vascular structures forum)
Management In the emergency department the patient is assessed by Hematology, who performs a peripheral blood smear, which confirms pancit, without blasts or dysplastic scrapes.
She received transfusion of three units of silicone, with good tolerance.
In addition to the finding of fever and abdominal pain (in the context of immunosuppression), urgent abdominal CT is requested.
We tried to perform diagnostic paracentesis, without success.
After extraction of hemocultives, urocultive and coprocultive, empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem was initiated and the patient was admitted to the hospital.
Febrile neutropenia in immunosuppressed patient was diagnosed and azathioprine was discontinued.
Patient was admitted to the plant presenting the following problems: 1) Liver disease with portal hypertension and subacute ascites (with pleural effusion), study; 2) Febrile syndrome, in immunocompromised, recent study; 3) Panurcit
Initial clinical manifestations included fever in the first 2 days. Empirical treatment with open-openem was initiated after the patient had achieved mild fever and was hemodynamically stable (tendency to hypoTA).
He had painful hepatomegaly and ascites requiring paracentesis evacuator on two occasions.
In the analytical controls in the first 48 hours of admission, the platelet count to 25,000/uL and leukocyte count to 1,200/uL with 300 segmented, and Hb 9:g/dL are decoded.
Mild hyperproteinemia, 5,4 g/dL, haptoglobin decreased (<10 mg/dL), bilirubin decreased (4,5-5%), hemostasis LDH 746 U/L Coomb
The opposite isolation was performed, and treatment was initiated with concentrated catheters, meropenem and treatment aimed at controlling ascites with holes, IV oral albumin and IV filgrastim.
Ascites (febrile syndrome and subacute ascites): Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, with data compatible with transudate (200 leucos/uL, 1000 responding erythrocytes, glucose > 1.1 g).
Negative microbiology, negative cytology and normal immunophenotype in ascitic fluid.
In blood: the study of hepatotropic virus, EBV, CMV, HIV, TB was negative.
Leishmania positive (the patient had a positive serological history in analytical one year before).
Tumor markers were negative (AFP, CA-125, CEA, CA-15-3, CA-19-9, CYFRA 21-1, B-hCG B-2-m).
Study of autoimmune hepatitis negative.
Echocardiogram was normal.
When fever was present, infectious causes were first ruled out (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and secondary peritonitis were ruled out, as well as infectious causes of liver disease) and the primary tumor cause of the peritoneum non-autoimmune cirrhosis known alcoholic fatty liver, other (hepatitis)
The most probable cause of ascites was PH, and the cause of PH was unclear, since CT performed in the emergency department did not show hepatic LOEs or thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins or veins.
Portal hypertension study: Coagulation disorders were studied because thrombosis of the hepatic venous system in a patient without previous liver disease is a cause of ascites of subacute onset.
The study of thrombophilias and synd.
Antiphospholipid was normal.
Hepatic Doppler ultrasound: Moderately enlarged liver without focal lesions; free intraperitoneal fluid; permeable portal and suprahepatic veins; portal hypertension (repermeabilization of paraum veins).
Hepatic angio-MRI: liver with a heterogeneous patchy signal; no ascitic fluid; signs of PH (repermeabilization of the paraumbilical vein and esophageal varices); enlarged spleen.
There are causes of chronic rhinosinusitis and postsinusitis.
Imaging tests ruled out presynostosis, such as portal vein thrombosis, with portal vein stenosis, diffuse liver failure due to tumors or enf.
Impregnaires, et secundary sinuses, as thrombosis of the suprahepatic vein or veins with walls, in addition to cirrhosis of the liver.
A final diagnostic test was performed: transjugular biopsy and liver hemodynamic study as a study of unrelated PH.
The study of pancit was focused on ruling out different etiologies: carious, toxicity, hemolysis, hypercholesterolemia, infectious causes and central origin.
The tests performed were: complete blood count: pancit with low regenerative anemia, high MCV, morphological smear without blasts, dysplasia, or sickle cells (high CIDH and ha CoTT negative),
Vitamins and met.
The iron was normal, discarding nonexistential.
Up to now, the patient presents with a pancytopenia with intravascular hemolytic anemia and severe neutropenia without neutrophil response.
Initially, stenosis was not found, but in its evolution it was presented as a consequence of PH, with possible hypercholesterolemia among other mechanisms.
Infectious and infectious serologies in blood were negative, except for Leishmaniasis, which will be discussed briefly later.
Autoimmunity and nocturnal paroxysmal hemoglobinuria tests were negative, peripheral blood immunophenotypes were normal and immunoglobulins were normal.
All this did not allow us to rule out: central or peripheral pharmacological toxicity, primary disease, myelooptisis or visceral leishmaniasis, so a bone marrow biopsy (BM) was performed.
Leishmaniasis, hepatomegaly, ascites, and subsequently, sickle cell anemia were ruled out.
He was born in Peru and had been living in Spain for 7 years, endemic areas of Leishmania donovani, causing visceral leishmaniasis or chance-azar, in addition to the clinical manifestations of kalamegaly and shivering hepatos
Analytically, cites and hypertransaminasemia appear, as our patient presented in his evolution.
It is diagnosed by identifying the atheromatous lesions in smears of aspirated tissue (basal, bone marrow or▁ganglia).
In our patient, serology of Leishmania (IFI) detected antibodies as 1/160 (significant titer).
In a sample of one year before the diagnosis, the titer was similar, making leishmaniasis less likely to be the cause of the disease.
Biopsy of bone marrow was finally performed.
Both Giemsa staining and culture, both in blood and BM, did not show signs of melanoma.
▁Definitive diagnostic tests · Splanchnic hemodynamic study: Enclaved suprahepatic pressure: 19.5 mm Hg, free suprahepatic pressure: 9 mm Hg, hepatic venous pressure gradient: 10.5 mm Hg.
Subsequent venography showed no findings.
Biopsy samples were taken.
Conclusion: clinically significant sinus portal hypertension.
 Transjugular liver biopsy: Vascular changes with nodular degenerative hyperplasia, dilation reosinus and ischemic focus, suggestive of an alteration in hypertension accompanying venous necrosis of the organ.
Mild acinar inflammatory changes that do not rule out a pharmacological origin.
Transjugular liver biopsy: Focal sinus vascular congestion, infiltrates located both within the inflammatory bowel and portal spaces.
 OM biopsy: Normal medullary parenchyma (3/5).
Erythroid and histiocytic hyperplasia and CD8+ interstitial lymphocytosis at the time of dosing.
A cytotoxic mechanism for cites with/without hemophagocytosis is not ruled out.
Clinical manifestations: The patient was admitted to hospital for 4 weeks.
Supportive treatment and antibiotic therapy were performed.
In the last week, there was a significant clinical improvement with significant reduction in hepatomegaly (non-painful and unstable angina).

Clinical judgement at discharge · Bicit severe resolved secondary to spinal cord toxicity due to azathioprine.
 Hemolytic anemia, not resolved.
Probable toxicity due to azathioprine, without being able to objectify other causes.
• Hepatic sinus obstructive disease (hepatic obstruction syndrome) of subacute evolution secondary to azathioprine toxicity.
· Febrile syndrome, in immunocompromised patients, with no clear infectious focus, resolved.
· Optic neuritis OI of autoimmune etiology.
Autoimmune optic neurmyelitis not affiliated.
