A 45-year-old male.
She lives in a rural epidemiological environment with contact with biomass, domestic animals and non-stabulated cattle, ex-smoker, diagnosed with Splenecmus Marginal Zone lymphoma stage IV, splenectomized.
She came to the emergency department with dyspnea and fever of 39 oC of acute onset.
On arrival, the patient was in poor general condition, normotensive, with HR 149 bpm, tachypnea and semiology of massive right pleural effusion, which was confirmed by complementary tests of Hb 976 mg MCL, among which we emphasize:
leucocytes 4800 x 103/mcL (PMN 99.3 %; Lymphocytes
Pleural drainage was performed with Pleureate, obtaining‚ñÅexudate ambar fluid and empirical antibiotic therapy with imipienem and amikacin IV was initiated.
The patient was admitted to hospital for hypoxemic left apical pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion.
Campylobacter coli is isolated in hemocultives and directs antibiotic therapy with haemodialysis or tracheal intubation and teicoplanin. However, the clinical course is torpid requiring admission to the ICU for acute failure multiorgan.
Microbiological studies are extended by Bronchiolalveolar Lavate.
The chest CT scan showed pulmonary infiltrates and signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, starting anticoagulation with Heparin not prescribed.
Perceived encephaloptic seizure during neurological windows was acquired with a cranial CAT scan and hypodense lesions were catalogued later by cerebral MRI.
The evolution in the ICU is unsatisfactory, and weaning from IMV is impossible, with cutaneous lesions appearing in the pair of faces and left thighs of retiform purpura type that are biopsied.
As a result of BAL and skin biopsy with isolation of Lichtheimia corymbifera being catalogued as invasive fungal disease (pulmonary, CNS and cutaneous) so treatment with cerebral amphoreticin is initiated liposomal lesion.
Finally, the patient died 24 days after admission.
Licht in the spirit of mental illness establishes a prognosis in the angiogram of the order of the vast majority of cases affecting immunosuppressed patients, clinically indistinguishable from fusarium or aspergillus intrcon
