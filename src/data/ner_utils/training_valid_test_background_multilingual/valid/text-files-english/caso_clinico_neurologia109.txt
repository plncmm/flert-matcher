Anamnesis A 36-year-old male with a history of recurrent rhinosinusitis and spontaneous pneumothorax.
He was an active smoker, occasional cannabis consumer and a former cocaine consumer (nasal and smoked).
He came to the emergency department for headache of 7 days of evolution, of great intensity, continuous (also nocturnal), located in the right periocular level.
In recent days, pain had intensified, becoming holocraneal and associating right ocular tear, evening "tiritone" and fever with maximum peaks of 40 oC.
She had experienced nausea and vomiting, which was associated with taking ibuprofen.
He did not report flu, myalgias or other symptoms.
Two months before, she had suffered a similar clinical picture, with right eye headache, vespertine, similar to the current episode without fever, which had resolved spontaneously within 10 days.
Physical examination revealed a febrile, asthenic patient, although with good general condition.
Neurological examination revealed final neck stiffness and positive bilateral Lassègue maneuver.
Pain upon palpation of the right eye and paranasal sinuses, and pain with eye movements were the most common.
The rest of the neurological examination and by devices did not show alterations at any level, except for one septic mouth with caries.
▁Complementary tests • Leukocytosis (21,000/mcl) with left shift, elevated CRP and procalcitonin were observed in the laboratory tests performed; and significant alteration of coagulation.
A Bengal rose was requested, which was negative.
• A cranial computed tomography (CT) was performed, in which only the presence of small and scarce extracerebral air bubbles in the right frontal region was observed.
• A lumbar puncture revealed the presence of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (220 leukocytes/field) predominantly segmented (95%), 86 mg/dl proteins and glucose in normal range.
Gram stain was negative.
With the diagnosis of acute meningitis by non-membered germ, empirical treatment of broad spectrum (ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin) was prescribed.
Diagnosis Frontal subdural empyema and aseptic meningitis related to parameningeal focus secondary to pansinusitis.
Treatment 24 hours after admission, and due to a clinical worsening with tendency to sleepiness, a new CT focused on the sinuses was requested, in which a right frontal sinusitis associated with right frontal sinus air empyema 5 mm was observed.
The patient was assessed by ENT, and urgent surgery was performed with opening and drainage of the maxillary sinuses, etm frontal rights, authenticated by the Neurosurgery Department.
Due to a new clinical worsening and an▁epileptic seizure, a new cranial CT scan was performed, which showed the persistence of occupation of the right paranasal sinuses and increased size of the empyema frontal line of approximately 6 mm, with cerebral deviation.
After urgent drainage of the empyema, in successive CT scans, extension of the empyema was observed at the right temporal level, insinuating the parietal lobe, which was a reintervention and a very wide craniectomy.
Culture of CSF and purulent material extracted from both empyema and drained paranasal sinuses was negative, but was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 8 weeks, with good clinical outcome.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated substantial temporal reduction of empyema.
Posterior sinus stenosis MR control showed radiological improvement of the empyema, persisting pansinusitis.
She was discharged waiting for a second surgery for the placement of a skull vault implant.
As a sequel of the episode, you suffer from symptomatic epilepsy that is being treated.
