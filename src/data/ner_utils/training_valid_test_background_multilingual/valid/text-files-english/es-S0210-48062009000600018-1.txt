An 80-year-old man with a history of TURP 3 years ago presented with pollakiuria, hypogastric pain and fever of 48 hours of evolution a month after surgery for an incarcerated right inguinal hernia.
When asked, she reported progressive worsening of her voiding jet in recent months.
Physical examination revealed bladder balloon, minimal serous secretion of inguinal wound and painful induration of the penile base.
A cystostomy tube was placed because of the impossibility of urethral catheterization and laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with deviation to the left and urine sediment positive to gram-negative bacilli, and was admitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment.
After clinical and analytical improvement, an abdominal ultrasound showed subtricial seroma at the right inguinal level and cystostomy tube cystography where an extravasation in the proximal penile urethra was observed.
After treating febrile UTI with positive urine culture for multisensitive C. trachomatis, the patient was discharged.
At the follow-up visit, the patient reported important perineal pain that had been treated with conservative and pathological symptoms contributed to the anatomo-pathological report of the surgery service where she had undergone inguinal hernia surgery, reporting that the‚ñÅresected material was adenocamopathy.
At that time, it was suggested as a possible urethral squamous cell carcinoma with inguinal adenopathy and an extension study was performed.
Pelvic MRI showed a collection of 3 cm between the urethra and the right body with no signs of stenosis, as well as right inguinal lymphadenopathy.The toco-abdominal CT showed a single adenopathy suggestive presence in upper lobe.
The patient was admitted due to poor perineal pain control and the appearance of several cutaneous nodular lesions in the pubis and right thigh.
Biopsy of one of these lesions was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient underwent 6 cycles of polychemotherapy with cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (CDDP 137 mg-5FU 6839 mg) with good tolerance and good initial clinical response with improvement of asthenia,
One month after the end of chemotherapy, the patient presented early progression of the disease with a higher number of skin lesions.
Perineal radiation therapy was then performed, achieving better pain control and a poor response to the lethaloids.
He is currently receiving palliative care at home, with treatment consisting of a palliative care team, 9 months after the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.
