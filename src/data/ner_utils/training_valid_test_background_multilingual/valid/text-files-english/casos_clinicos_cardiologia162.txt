Outpatient follow-up was scheduled.

NURSING A CURRENT Cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) as an alternative to resuscitation performed by a mobile emergency unit (ICU) after an out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (ECC) managed in less than ten minutes.
The patient after recovering spontaneous circulation, in sinus rhythm, persists with low level of consciousness, so he required intubation and mechanical ventilation by the mobile IVU.
The event took place on the street, without close relatives as witnesses.
Later, the patient does not remember what happened at that moment (lacunar amnesia) and refers to having been asymptomatic in the previous days.
PHYSICAL EXPLORATION Upon arrival, the patient was afflicted with ventilation, heart rate (HR) 82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 155/83 50% mmHg, and 100% SatO2 with orotracheal intubation, connected to
Carotid disease without murmurs.
Normal jugular venous pressure.
Cardiac auscultation revealed a pink holistholic murmur in the mitral area radiating to the axilla (similar to that described in previous cardiology explorations).
vesicular eruption with conserved mucus.
Abdominal examination showed no pathological findings.
Good distal perfusion, no edema.
Central and distal peace.
Laboratory tests: biochemistry: glucose 260 mg/dl, creatinine 1.26 mg/dl, urea 36 mg/dl, normal ions, troponin T US 18 ng/dl and CKl 107 at 3 hours
Blood count: Hb 15.6 g/dl, normal leukocytes and platelets.
Coagulation: PT 109%, aPTT and D-D within normal range.
Toxic: undetectable ethanol, negative urine residual toxics
Arterial gasses: pH 7.2, pCO2 65 mmHg, pO2 163 mmHg, bicarbonate 21"3 mmol/l.
Portable chest X-ray: cardiomegaly anteroposterior.
Properly positioned endotracheal tube
No pulmonary congestion data.
Electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm.
Normal PR.
Left side.
Left anterior hemiblock.
narrow QRS.
ST decrease of approximately 1 mm in V4-V6 and T wave flattened in aVL.
Urgent skull CT: no evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
Perfusion map and normal supra-aortic trunks.
Echocardioscopy in the emergency room showed a poor echocardiographic window.
Left ventricle (LV) of normal size and slightly hypertrophic.
LVEF is moderately affected by global hypokinesia with thinning zone and hypocontractility in the inferoposterior basal segment.
Normal right ventricle (RV).
Mitral regurgitation that is at least moderate to very eccentric (ischemic vs.
Normal aortic and tricuspid valves.
No pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries with minimal irregularities, without significant stenosis.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out: preserved LVEF.
Acinesia insurance scheme or insurance scheme.
Normal RV.
Mitral regurgitation (probably severe) with posterior leaflet.
Normal rectum.
Transesophageal echocardiography: confirms severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior leaflet with predominance of anterior directed jet with Coanda effect.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): mitral stenosis with associated severe mitral regurgitation.
VI dilated (VTD 120 ml/m2).
Weakening and hypocontractility of the basal and mid inferolateral segments, with late intramyocardial enhancement in the inferolateral basal segment.
RV of normal size and function.
‚ñÅCLINICAL EVOLUTION The evolution of the patient is good during his stay in the VIU, being able to extubate at 24 hours and going to a stable and asymptomatic hospitalization plant.
A broad differential diagnosis, such as cardiorespiratory arrest, had already begun in the emergency room.
The complementary tests were carried out and the malignant mitral valve diagnosis was reached as the cause of the event.
During hospitalization, she presented several streaks of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (with upper axis and morphology of right bundle branch block).
In severe mitral regurgitation with LV dilatation confirmed by MR, it was decided in medical-surgical session mitral valve repair intervention, which takes place at admission, with implantation of two neo-cords Goretex MB2 plus 30 mm/0 a
Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was subsequently implanted in secondary prevention.
The clinical evolution can be discharged with the following medication: toemide 10 mg, ramipryl 2.5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg atorvastatin 40 mg, cardiometabolic goal tramadol 100 mg, ferrimanol 5 mg.
DIAGNOSIS Malignant mitral valve prolapse.
Resuscitated cardiorespiratory arrest, in rhythm.
Severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral stenosis
Dilatation of the left ventricle.
Ventricular tachycardia monoforms not measured
