Anamnesis A 28-year-old male patient, with the only condyloma acuminata in the perianal and genital region, who was diagnosed with common acute▁lymphoid leukemia aqueminated (B).
Initially she received chemotherapy, which is effective, until 9 years after the diagnosis she presents a late recurrence refractory to chemotherapy.
As there are no HLA identical siblings, a haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is performed from their mother.
After infusion, the patient begins with urinary discomfort, penile glans injury and inguinal pain.
Physical appearance Skin of necrotic penis
A yellow-green, balanopreputial ulcerated lesion with purulent▁exudate, painful to palpitation.
Inguinal adenopathies.
▁Complementary tests • Culture of▁exudate: growth of multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies.
•▁Haemocultives: colony growth of Pseudo aeruginosa multiresistant.
• Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a hyperintense signal in penile tissues, with covered destructuring and presence of gas.
Diagnosis Ectopic sclerosis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia.
Treatment Antibiotic coverage by intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 hours.
Measures of life support in the Intensive Care Unit.
After systemic stabilization, the patient is placed on the ward, where he remains for a period of 3 weeks in treatment with local cures and unsatisfactory evolution.
On the 52th day post-infusion, a wide surgical debridement was performed, removing the entire necrotic skin surface, and the resulting defect was evaluated by Plastic Surgery.
The penis is completely debrided, with skin fully debrided, with a purulent▁exudate, which remains positive for P. aeruginosa.
Cures based on tapering (first with ointment and later in dressings) are prescribed for cleaning the lesion with a view to surgery.
Firstly, penile coverage with a partial skin graft is proposed.
Given the situation of hematologic chimerism of the patient due to her maternal HSCT, this graft should proceed not from the patient but from her mother, in order to avoid the graft-versus-host reaction1.
On the 93th day post-infusion, in the dorsal decubitus position with a monosymptomatic receiver, the gross partial skin graft was extracted from a maternal donor and, under spinal anesthesia, a single graft was implanted as a receiver.
The implant is performed by traction of the penis body to its maximum extension and after the suture a ferulization2-4 bandage is available.
No complications occurred in the postoperative period, and after grafting was confirmed, the patient was discharged.
The 6-month follow-up showed complete coverage of the penis with the graft, with no signs of rejection, flexibility of the graft, and adequate functionality.
