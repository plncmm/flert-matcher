A 9-year-old girl, with no relevant pathological history, presented with a pruritic rash, with small‚ñÅpapulo-eritematous lesions that in some areas become confluous palms and palms.
There was no enanthema and the patient was afflicted.
The patient had been taking amoxicillin for 9 days due to LII pneumonia diagnosed in the reference hospital.
The differential diagnosis is initially made with: Micoplasma pneumoniae infection, viral exanthema (probable infectious mononucleosis), drug allergy to amoxicillin and toxicodermia.
Because of the clinical picture of the patient, it was decided to suspend antibiotic treatment, an antihistamine was prescribed to calm the pruritus and a blood test was requested.
The results of the first laboratory tests were: ESR 31; Hb 14.1 g/dl; Hto 41; leukocytes 8.200 (N 44.7%; L 42.1%; M 9.3%; Eplasma IgG 2204; platelets 564.000
After this first analytical test, she takes more the possible viral etiology, probably a monoxonucleic syndrome GL negative, and at 2 weeks a control analytical is performed with the following results: GOT 130 positive Paul IgM / L IgG ser IgG IgG IgG; GPT IgG 3
Arrived at this point, it was decided to repeat the analytical one month later, expanding the study and discarding the most frequent causes of transaminitis.
The results were: GOT 228 U/L; GPT 483U/L; GGT 257U/L; CPK 87 U/L; alpha-1-antripsin 147 mcg/dl negative antinuclear antibody serology 43 mcg/dl
After this analysis, the suspicion focuses on Wilson's disease.
To complete the study copper was requested in urine, with the result of 170 mcg/24 h (normal: 0-60) and liver ultrasound showing mild steatosis.
With the suspicion of a patient with a diagnosis of D-penicillosis, she was referred to the pediatric hepatology unit of a reference hospital where the diagnosis was confirmed and treatment with D-penicillium (+) was initiated.
