On February 28, a 50-year-old man with IgA nephropathy who received a third kidney from a deceased donor in 2016, with an estimated 24-hour history of glomerular fever (GFR), estimated 24-hour history of fever (GFR)
She reported no other symptoms, no history of travel abroad, or exposure to infected or pre-existing infected patients with COVID-19.
The patient's medical history suggested a scheduled resection of the tumor in 2003, caused by thrombocytopenia,▁lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) associated with Epstein's disease secondary to renal failure secondary to a complete remission of the disease.
After remission of PLE and a negative EBV viral load, she received a third renal transplant with induction of immunosuppression (IS) by thymoglobulin, tracrolimus, everólium dialimus and▁steroids,
He was also being treated for high blood pressure with 50 mg losartan twice daily.
In a first evaluation in the emergency department, the patient presented with symptoms of a slight disorientation.
Physical examination was, moreover, irrelevant, including respiratory sounds on auscultation.
Clinical analysis of acute phase proteins were normal, such as C-reactive protein < 0.50 mg/dL (normal value < 1.0 mg/dL) and leukocyte count of 8.58 x 109/L, but mild renal dysfunction (1.6 mg/dL).
She was discharged with a provisional diagnosis of non-severe viral gastroenteritis and oral hydration and acetaminophen were prescribed on demand.
Five days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with persistent fever but coughing.
She no longer presented gastrointestinal symptoms.
Physical examination showed a temperature of 37.4 °C, blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg, pulse of 66 l.p.m., respiratory rate of 16 r.p.m.
and 98% oxygen saturation in room air.
The patient presented signs of mucosal erythematosis and crackles in the lower part of the right lung, as well as signs of conjunctivitis in the left eye.
Cardiac examination showed no murmurs, frictions or gallops.
The abdomen was blade, painless and depressible and the neurological examination was normal.
Leukocytes in peripheral blood were 10.15 x 109/L (total lymphocyte count 1.8 x 109 U/L), with a thrombocyte count of 126 x 109/L, a procalcitonin value 0.50 mg/L).
A slight persistent renal dysfunction (Cr 1.6 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (129 mEq/L) were also observed.
Hepatic transaminases and coagulation were within normal reference values.
An anteroposterior radiograph showed consolidation in the middle lobe.
Consequently, a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was assumed and a provisional treatment of ceftriaxone (1 g per day) and beta blockers (1500 mg per day) was initiated.
A nasopharyngeal smear and a rapid nucleic acid amplification test were performed for influenza A and B and respiratory non-disorder virus, which were negative.
Subsequently, although the patient had no history of travel or contact with known infected people, the local authorities collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for screening tests of COVID-19 after an update.
Real-time RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 of both smears were positive (from this moment considered as reference day: D0).
The local protocol for the COVID-19 was activated, with hospitalization of the patient in isolation and on day D+1 treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 b.i.d. orally was started.
Due to the interaction of ritonavir with calcineurine inhibitors, tacrolimus was removed, as was everómilus due to the identified risk of mnitis-induced pneumonitis.
A provisional treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics (cephataroline and meronepem) was initiated and maintained, despite negative results from cultures of viral, bacterial or fungal infections, such as pneumocystosis.
Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed orally (400 mg twice daily for 24 hours, then 200 mg twice daily).
After 10 days from the initial symptoms and 72 h of symptomatic and antiviral treatment, the patient showed worsening of respiratory symptoms, with hypoxia, despite the contribution of nasal oxygen to diffuse high flow, CT and a progression in bilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
At this time, interferon ß was administered. The patient was intubated (D+6), with assisted breathing and high positive end-expiratory pressure (12 cmH2O).
Serum creatinine increased to 2.1 mg/dL (eGFR 30 ml/min), with tacrolimus, remaining 10 days after withdrawal to 5.1 ng/mL.
Currently (D+12), the patient is still breathing in the ICU, is hemodynamically stable and is still receiving lopinavir/navir 400 mg twice daily (interferon/100 mg orally administered) treatment (if available at hospital) twice daily.
It has serum creatinine values of 3.0 mg/dL, white blood cells of 14.5 x 109 U/L, lymphocytes of 0.9 x 109 U/L, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/DL, normal thrombocytes of 410 x 109 U/L
