A 19-year-old male who was brought to consultation by his family because of abnormal behavior for three or four days.
The family had come two days before to ask for help on how to‚ñÅconvince the patient to come to the consultation.
When he comes to the clinic, the patient has a partial awareness of the disease, being aware that something strange happens to him: he refers that from the past weekend, where he had consumed between 10 and 15 different cannabis consumptions a day, he feels that he has.
In his usual work (he is a bar waiter) he interprets people's gestures towards him as annoyance, "as if they censor him what he does."
At home he is angry and distant person, "as isolated, in his world", and at some point, when he shows interest in what happens to him, he has responded aggressively.
As this situation got worse, they went to the consultation.
The family describes it as "a good boy", something nicknamed and with some difficulty in social relations.
He had left his studies a year ago, and had begun to work in a bar from an acquaintance, without trouble.
The family has been disorganized, with separation from the parents for 4 years, with poor relationship between both.
He is the third of five brothers, with a bad relationship between all, having taken a different game after separation from his parents.
No family history of mental illness.
She has been consuming cannabis since she was 13 years old, with an initial consumption of the weekend with friends of two to three daily consumptions.
Subsequently, after separation from parents (he was 15 years old) consumption increases until daily consumption, in a quantity of 5-6 times/day.
Non-consumption of other toxic substances (sporadic).
Recently, the consumption was 10 cigars a day.
The family reported that it had been very bad after separation from the parents.
They also mention two or three previous episodes similar to the current one, after a high consumption of cannabis at the weekend, which ceased without treatment after being kept on a friendly footing.
The patient admits taking medication for one month ( risperidone is administered up to 3 mg/day): in subsequent appointments there is complete remission of symptoms and intolerance to the side effects of treatment (sedation).
In telephone follow-up, the family reports that the patient is well and has not resumed the consumption.
Two years later, she came to the emergency service of the Provincial Hospital with the family for presenting a similar episode, with greater conduct disorders (verbal aggression at home and at work), of one week duration.
The symptoms were similar, although the patient had pseudoauditory manifestations (you increpated).
He had not fallen into bed when he went to the consulting room, and had broken a furniture at home.
A short-term admission to achieve cannabis abstinence (had been consuming again for 6 months, increasing consumption up to 4-5 times/day at present) and starting a treatment, which he admits, is proposed.
During admission, the same treatment is administered at a dose of 2 mg/day and there is a rapid remission of symptoms, asking the patient to be discharged on the 5th day after admission.
Risperidone is administered in depot form before leaving due to a history of treatment discontinuation (25 mg/14 days).
In subsequent controls, the patient remains suffering from psychotic symptoms and does not present psychotic symptoms, but a mild depressive condition reactive to the experience of problems caused to the family.
Subsequently, treatment is discontinued and the consultations are re-established every three months.
Six months later, the psychotic symptoms reappeared after cannabis consumption (which had restarted three months earlier, with consumption of 8-10 times/day), on this occasion that the patient had repeatedly complained of suicide, for the second and third reason.
In this case, admission is involuntary ( given the high risk of suicide and the lack of awareness of the disease).
The admission lasts two months, being discharged with neurogenic seizures and partial remission of symptoms, with a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.
