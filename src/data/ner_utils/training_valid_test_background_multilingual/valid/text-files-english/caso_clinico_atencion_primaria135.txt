Family and Community approach This is a patient with special vulnerability since it is an unaccompanied foreign minor (the age officially known that it is not real, but we ignore the true infection), who has made a long trip to health
Therefore, he is an individual at risk of suffering diseases that can be little known in our health area and that, when he is in precarious condition when▁arriving to our country, he must pay special attention because he is in a period of African Magist
The risk of geographical mobility will also make it difficult to monitor the patient.
Clinical judgement (list of problems, referential diagnosis) - Intestinal schistosomiasis - Chronic hepatitis B to be ruled out (we do not know if it is positive for HBsAg) - BMI 17, thin.
Plan of Action - She was referred to external infectious disease consultations after direct contact with them to avoid delay, and was referred to the following week to learn the results of the requested complementary tests.
There they request treatment for schistosomiasis, which is praziquantel 40 mg/kg in a dose or repeated in two doses.
This medication is not available in our country, so the infectious diseases service has made the prescription and sent it to the Ministry of Health, since it is a foreign medication.
She was also referred to complete the immunological study of hepatitis B.
- The patient was referred to a nursing consultation to initiate a complete vaccination as the previous immunizations of the patient were completely unknown (previously hepatitis B serology was performed).
- You were told to return to our consultation after evaluation by the infectious disease service for further follow-up.
- I prescribed oral iron.
