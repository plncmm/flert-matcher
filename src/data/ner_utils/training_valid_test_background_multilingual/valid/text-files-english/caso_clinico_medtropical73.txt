Physical examination revealed a macular oval lesion of light brown homogeneous and well-defined borders of 1.5 x 1.0 cm.
Dermoscopy revealed multiple brown spicules, unrelated to grooves or crests, which did not follow any pattern suggestive of a sickle cell lesion.
With the clinical suspicion of tinea nigra palmar, and after ruling out physical examination and dermoscopy a new cystoid lesion. After treatment with tape was initiated, treatment was repeatedly observed for persistence of the lesion.
This was performed at the Colombian Institute of Tropical Medicine, where the lesion was scraped for direct examination and culture.
