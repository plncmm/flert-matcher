The patient also presented dyspnea on moderate exertion and pleuritic pain in the left side.
Physical examination revealed an 8 cm mass, of about 6 months of evolution, ulcerated at the level of ECI of the left breast, without signs of infection, without palpable lymph nodes in other axillary chains,
The patient also complained of pain on palpation of the spinous process at the level of D12, L1 and L2; the rest of the examination showed no abnormalities.
▁Complementary tests The following complementary tests are performed in the emergency room: - chest X-ray: spiculated nodule of approximately 1.5 cm in LII - X-ray of the spine: blastic lesions at LPT level 89; alkaline phosphatase LDH -
Rest of parameters in the normal range.
After expansion, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent MRI of the spine and breast MRI. A posterior spinal cord injury was observed in the MRI scan of the spine D12 with an urgent extension in both vertebral bodies.
Greater involvement of the L1 vertebral body with signs of bone expansion and involvement of all posterior elements.
Setup holes were severe in D12-L1, moderate in L1-L2, and mild-moderate in D11-D12, and radicular compromise in D12 and L1.
Affectation of the spinous apophysis of L2 and two nodular foci in D11 suggestive of metastasis.
Breast MRI showed an 8x8x5 mass in the ECI of the left breast, with exophytic growth, poorly defined contours and signs of skin involvement.
BAG is performed, which is positive for Notingham Grade II Ductal Infiltrating Characteristics, SR 100%, PR 90%, Her 2 +++, Ki 67 60%.
Luminal B Her 2+.
In an extension study, CT also reports a right paratracheal adenopatic▁conglomerate of 3.5 cm and pulmonary nodules, greater than 15 mm in the apical segment of LII and in the LSI of 5 mm.
In GGO, there are multiple lesions with a predominance of chondrolytic junction obstruction of the 3rd costal arch, in posterior segments of 5th right costal arch and fracture of 2nd left costal arch.
Diagnosis Finally with the diagnosis of Ductal Infiltrating Multidisciplinary Mama cT4NxM1 luminal B Her 2 positive receives hospital discharge on 10/10/2015 and the patient is evaluated systemically in Committee.
Treatment After being evaluated in medical appointments, it was decided to start spinal anti-inflammatory radiotherapy due to poor analgesic control.
Subsequently, she began chemotherapy in the first line with Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab-Trastuzumab without notable toxicities.
Upon visiting the clinic to receive the second cycle, the patient continues with low back pain with functional limitation despite third step analgesia and even reports greater weakness in the lower limbs, although without loss of strength on examination.
demonstrate fracture without suspicion of spinal cord compression decides to hospitalize, steroid treatment is initiated at high doses and spinal MRI is performed compared with the previous objective spinal cord involvement at the level of the superior vertebral body kyphoplasty and secondary myelopathy.
Relative rest was indicated, without neurological symptoms at the time of evaluation , and options for orthosis and rehabilitation were assessed, after consultation with the Rehabilitation Service, dorsolumbar orthosis was performed.
With good initial evolution, the 16/1215 chemotherapy cycles corresponding to Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab- Docetaxel with zolendronic acid were prescribed.
After 48 h of the cycle, the patient presented fever without apparent source (except for tumor lesion in the breast), so she began empirical therapy with Augmentine (after culture is positive for Staf.
Amoxicillin-sensitive Aureus).
The patient had a good initial evolution and received 3rd cycle of CMT on January 7, 2016.
However, the patient presented fever peaks, so when a clear focus was absent, a CT was requested for tumor reassessment and for the study of persistent febrile syndrome.
A CT scan showed a clear tumor response, but an abdominal lesion suggestive of intestinal perforation secondary to abscess located at the sigma level was observed.
It is operated on urgently on the 8/1/16 performed Hartmannli type with resection and Klebsiella isolation (ileum paralytic which required NGT and feverish picture in the context of neutropenia post-chemotherapy Faecalis).
In the anatomopathological study of abdominal surgery, peritoneal implants not consistent with known primary breast tumor were reported, after extensive▁immunohistochemical study (cell positivity for CK-AE1-AE3, papillary progesterone receptor for GADF, W15 was confirmed.
A retrospective CT scan showed a right adnexal mass of about 6 cm and multiple peritoneal implants.
The case is reassessed in the Clinical Section and, when the diagnosis of ovary is made, chemotherapy is modified in order to maintain the response achieved in the breast with adequate coverage to the second ovarian cancer.
Therefore, Carboplatin-Paclitaxel chemotherapy is indicated, as well as Her-2 block maintenance. Therefore, after resolution of post-surgery complications and withdrawal of isolation, the patient is discharged.
It receives on 11/2/2016, 1st cycle (80% dose), without remarkable toxicity, receives the following cycles with 100% dose with PR by CT after 4 cycles, pending evaluation after 6 cycles.
The patient was referred to the Genetic Council consultation with molecular results 5382insC in BRCA1, confirming that the patient is carrying this mutation, indicating follow-up for her and her descendants follow-up in that genetic unit.
