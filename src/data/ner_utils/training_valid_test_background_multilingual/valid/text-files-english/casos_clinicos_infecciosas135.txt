A 76-year-old male was admitted for a febrile syndrome preceded by chills and thiritens.
The patient's personal history included an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that had been urgently intervened one year earlier, by endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm and placement of bi- and iliac endoprostheses Endurant®, with anchorage
A control CT angiography was performed two months after surgery, which showed adequate permeability of the stent without signs of endoleak. It was extended by a hypodense collection of 10x10x4 cm interpreted as venous hematoma with enhancement.
CT angiography was repeated nine months after surgery (3 months before hospital admission), showing persistence of the periprosthetic collection although with a significant decrease in size (8x8x2cm).
The possibility of infectious complications was raised, but in the absence of fever, abdominal pain and elevation of acute phase reactants conservative management was decided assuming the first diagnostic suspicion.
In the month prior to admission, the patient suffered intermittent and self-limiting episodes of fever with a predominance of evening fever, preceded by chills and shirts.
For this reason, please contact your Primary Care doctor who diagnosed you with urinary tract infection and prescribed ciprofloxacin treatment.
After completing 7 days of treatment the same symptoms reappeared, reason why she was admitted for study.
Physical examination revealed rhythmic tones at 90 beats per minute, with systolic murmur V/VI irradiated to the axilla not previously described.
Pulmonary sequestration and abdominal palpation are normal.
There are no lower limb edemas or stigmata of systemic embolisms.
Blood count showed a hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dl (normocytic-normochromic) with white blood cell series and normal platelets.
Coagulation was normal, and biochemical tests showed CRP of 120 mg/l with normal renal function and creatinine levels.
Chest X-ray was also normal.
A bedside echocardiography was performed showing preserved LV diameter and systolic function, with moderate and eccentric mitral regurgitation in a possible mitral valve connection.
The differential diagnosis between endovascular stent graft infection and infective endocarditis (IE) is discussed.
On admission, given the patient's clinical and hemodynamic stability, it was decided to extract serial hemocultives and wait for results for antibiotic treatment.
In the first 72 hours growth occurs in 2mp of each antibiotic/4kg gentamicin aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis, so when there is suspicion of infection of the endoprosthesis directed, 2 mg cannot be ruled out.
In the first 48h after starting antibiotic treatment, the patient developed erythematous-violaceous lesions in soles of the feet, compatible with Osler nodules and abdominal discomfort with vomiting without alteration of intestinal transit.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and afflicted.
After commenting on the case with Vascular Surgery Service, we reached a consensus on the conservative antibiotic treatment versus elective surgery due to the high surgical risk.
Differential diagnosis We propose the differential diagnosis between associated and non-associated endoprosthesis infection.
The presence of a febrile syndrome with a bacteriemic profile and the existence of a periprosthetic collection made us think about the infection of the endoprosthesis as the first possibility, although the decrease in the periprosthetic hematoma supported by angio-CTs.
However, polymicrobial bacteremia in a patient with an infrarenal aortic endoprosthesis, two pathogens responsible for subacute course infections, supported the infectious etiology.
Microorganisms isolated in hemocultives, both Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis are germs present in the oropharyngeal flora, without the patient presenting oral inflammatory or infectious processes.
The presence of bacteremia in the context of a bacterial endocarditis caused by pathogens frequently occurring in a patient with valvular pathology and a new murmur should be ruled out.
The natural history of this disease is extremely variable and is directly related to the causative agent.
Thus, it can present as an acute infection of rapid progression with heart failure, cardiogenic shock and/or systemic embolisms, usually when produced by Staphylococcus spp, but also as a subacute or chronic disease caused by Streptococcus spp.
and Enterococcus spp.
Less frequently, it is produced by slow-growing pathogens such as Aggregatibacter spp., which account for 0.3% of native valve infections and 1.1% of those that lie on prosthetic valves.
This larvated presentation could agree with the clinical features of our patient.
There are very rare clinical manifestations, but highly suggestive of infective endocarditis such as Janeway's lesions (another painful erythematous macules in palms and soles), osteolytic nodules in the reddish spots of the hand (mainly erythematous of the pear spots of the skin).
Establishment of a diagnosis based on modified Duke criteria, which consists of major and minor criteria.
Our patient met three major infectious endocarditis criteria, one major positive for germ HACEK group and two minor (fever and immune phenomena such as Osler nodules), being necessary for the diagnosis
Echocardiography is the technique of choice for diagnosis of stenosis and has an essential role in the management and monitoring of these patients.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed when the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is negative and there is high clinical suspicion or positive TTE to rule out local complications.
However, there are situations such as mitral stenosis (as in the case of our patient), degenerative lesions and prosthetic valves that reduce the sensitivity of this test.
The evaluation of patients with infective endocarditis is no longer limited to conventional echocardiography, but should include other imaging techniques such as multislice CT, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and active positron emission tomography (PET) in place.
xau seated aorta with abdominal fluid angio-CT showing a bifurcated abdominal endoprosthesis without signs of endoleak and adequate permeability, persisting a mass of density of previous 0.6 x 10.5 cm hollow sections
At this level, water density lesion and anfractuous edges were observed in relation to fluid collection, stable with respect to previous studies.
Once these results were obtained, CT-guided FNAB of the collection was performed, in which S. oralis and A. aphrophilus grew in the same sample as those isolated from the hemocultives.
Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation due to rupture of tendinous chords of P2, with no signs suggestive of endocarditis.
Blood cultures for control were negative 72 hours after antibiotic treatment was started.
Since the introduction of antibiotic treatment, fever did not recur, with progressive improvement in general condition.
Similarly, there was a progressive decrease in acute phase reactants and recovery from anemia of chronic disorder.
After 14 days of treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin, we continued on an outpatient basis in a day hospital with ceftriaxone 2 g/day until the month of treatment.
After this, we started levofloxacin 500 mg/day.
She did not present complications derived from antibiotic treatment and maintained acute phase reactants in normal range.
▁Definitive diagnosis Endovascular prosthesis infection by Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Streptococcus oralis.
