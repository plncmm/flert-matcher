We present an 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension with years of controlled evolution with 4 drugs; Diabetes Mellitus type 2 in treatment with oral antidiabetics; Ischemic Heart Disease (Double-Block AMI and 2011; RA angioplasty in 2000; and folic acid in 2000;
In October▁2015, the patient was admitted for a distal penetrating aortic ulcer. An AFX 22-60 bifurcated stent was placed. In December▁2015, a straight Endurant tube was implanted inside a locked lock.
With this background, the patient came to the emergency department with a fever of 39oC of a week of evolution, without jaundice and anorexia.
He did not report apparent infectious symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable.
Awareness and guidance in the 3
Cardiopulmonary arrest without pathological findings.
Not neck stiffness.
▁Pulse asymmetry was pedal with absent left, symmetrical radial.
No other findings.
Analytically, chronic iron deficiency anemia with Hb of 11.3 g/dl; 8000 leukocytes.
Normal renal function and renal function.
PCR 143 mg/L and PCT 6 ng/ml.
Urocultive (negative) and the first tanda of hemocultives were extracted, in which a viridans group was isolated.
In view of the above, PET-CT was requested to rule out endoprosthesis infection, which showed increased metabolism in the posterior region of the abdominal aortic endoprosthesis compatible with an infectious process.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which ruled out infective endocarditis.
Vascular surgery after evaluating the case, given the advanced age along with the other previous comorbidity, reject performing other diagnostic tests and explanting the prosthesis.
Thus, as the only valid treatment in this case, the suppressive antibiotic therapy and control in the Vascular Surgery outpatient clinic are indicated.
In the Infectious Diseases Unit, intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated with peracillin/ Piperacillin dressing (P/T) for 15 days along with vancomycin for 4 days, and the patient was discharged from hospital after 10 days.
After 15 days of treatment with P/T amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg was replaced orally indefinitely.
