A 79-year-old woman with a history of osteonecrosis of the right chest after treatment for breast cancer 20 years ago.
She was admitted for fever, dyspnea, chest wall fistula, right pleural effusion, mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia and marked elevation of CRP (245 mg/L) and Procalcitonin (19.33 ng/mL).
A chest CT scan showed massive pleural effusion and signs of osteonecrosis in the 3rd to 5th right costal arches with wall involvement.
Pleural drainage resulted in empyema with pure isolate of Baoides fragilis, also cultivated in▁exudate of the external fistula.
The▁exudate cytology showed no malignancy.
The patient was diagnosed with sepsis and infection by Baccoidosis of the chest wall including osteomyelitis with contiguity to the pleural cavity and empyema.
He received Metronidazole and Imipenem with progressive improvement, but 9 days later he developed seizures with iv seizures with hyponatremia of 113 mEq/L, in a situation of euvolemia and compatible index with FurstDH.
Imipenem was removed due to its potential with a tapered dressing, and Metronidazole was maintained and Tolvaptan 15 mg/day was administered with sodium correction.
Seven months later, the patient remained afflicted with Met and paucisymptomatic with oral metronidazole and required Tolvaptan due to persistent hyponatremia.
