A 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic nephropathy was admitted to the Hospital and Emergency Delphina Rinaldi Abdel Aziz, a reference center for treatment of Manaus COID,
The patient was admitted to another hospital and was diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR.
Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was intubated, received a high dose of vasoconstrictor, was hemodynamically oriented, and presented with cardiorespiratory and cold extremities.
Norepinephrine was administered at 1.41 μg/kg/min and invasive mechanical ventilation was applied to aspirate an orotracheal tube with high parameters (positive telespiratory pressure 8/FiO2 26 60%/respiratory rate).
The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 86.6.
Oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) and chloroquine (450 mg twice daily on the first day) were administered via nasoenteral cannula i.v.
(500 mg/day), ceftriaxone i.v.
(2 g/day), furosemide i.v.
(20 mg three times daily) and subcutaneous prophylactic enoxaparin (40 mg/day).
Corticosteroids were not used.
Analytical tests showed hyperuricemia 0.7 mg/dL and increased creatinine (8.46 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein (12 mg/L).
Normal values of potassium and sodium (5.24 mmol/L and 136.8 mmol/L, respectively) were observed.
The following results were also obtained: leukocytes 6.530/μL, thrombocytes 285x109/μL, hemoglobinemia 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 34.5%,▁lymphocytic colitis (8, neutrophilia).
Chest X-rays showed consolidation and nodular in the right lower lobe.
No CAT scans were performed.
Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.
On the third day after admission, the patient became hemodynamically worse and presented resistant shock, with irreversible hypotension and bradycardia.
He died the next day.
Microscopic analysis of lung tissue showed clearly defined presence of Aspergillus structures, including fungal hyphae and spores, as well as a well-defined Aspergillus head, with phyllalides, conidia and spores.
