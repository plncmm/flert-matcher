He had traveled to Sierra▁Leone for three years and in Thailand for six without any relevant health problems.
He came to the Infectious Diseases Clinic of our center due to the presence of nodular pruritic skin lesions (figures 1 and 2) of 1 year of evolution in the upper extremities, ear pinna, hips and back.
Some of these lesions had ulcerated.

and Giardia intestinalis) and Graham's test for Enterobius vermicularis, skin biopsy and cultures.
Pathologic diagnosis was made as a nodular prurigo.
A brain CT scan was completed and all normal or negative tests were performed. After reasonably organicity was ruled out, the patient was provisionally diagnosed with Ekbom Syndrome (Lausional Pregabalin Parasitosis was started).
The patient refused both the diagnosis and treatment initially and even managed to▁convince his wife and children that they suffered from the same disease.
After 2 months attending the clinic frequently, the patient assumed her diagnosis and started treatment with aripiprazole 2.5 (1-0-0) and pregabalin 75 (0-0-1), with improvement of symptoms after 3 weeks of treatment.
In addition, the patient admitted this diagnosis and papulately accepted that he did not suffer any organic disease, the relationship with his wife and children also improved.
Three months after the onset of symptoms she had become aware of the disease and is currently symptom free.
