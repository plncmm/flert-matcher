Anamnesis A 17-year-old woman with difficult-to-control atopic dermatitis who, after lack of response to phototherapy (closed-band UVB), received▁cyclosporine, but the patient discontinued it after 2 months due to poor improvement.
The patient had a history of severe congenital mitral regurgitation and secondary heart failure.
He came to the emergency department with a fever of 39oC with general▁malaise, rhinorrhea, arthralgias in feet and hands, mucous vomiting, watery diarrhea and acral skin lesions of 6 days duration.
The patient reported having been camping in a home.
Physical examination revealed several erythematous-violaceous subcutaneous nodules, intensely painful on the feet and hands.
In addition, pale skin areas with diffuse edges in acral zones with slow capillary▁refill.
Necrotic skin areas were not observed.
He also presented generalized xerosis with skin thickening in folds and erosions secondary to scratching.
▁Complementary laboratory tests: anaemia, platelet count and elevated acute phase reactants.
• Serologies: (clamidia, triponema, coxoxiella, myco, bartonella, bartonella, tularella, treponema, riponema, hepatitis B, CMV, parvovirus).
• Echocardiogramtran transesophageal: negative for endocarditis due to bacterial endocarditis in Gram-positive peripheral blood: growth of Gram-positive▁cocci in clusters • Hemoculture: growth of Staphilocomycin acid-congenital dermatitis
After several days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient's general condition improved, the hemocultives became negative and the skin lesions reappeared until complete disappearance.
No residual ischemic skin or other organ lesions were observed.
The patient became aware of the importance of good control of her AD and currently has good adherence to▁cyclosporine.
