We report the case of a 25-year-old man who came to our outpatient clinic from Internal Medicine for repeated episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia.
As a family history, she has diabetic grandparents under treatment with oral antidiabetics and insulin.
His personal history included epilepsy treated with valproic acid and levetiracetam and a chronic diarrheal syndrome not affiliated.
She used cannabis up to a month before the first consultation.
In the anamnesis, the patient reports frequent episodes of hypoglycemia with values below 30 mg/dl of capillary glycemia, accompanied by tremors and sweating, not related to the ingestion, and which remit after ingestion of carbohydrates.
She denied administration of hypoglycemic drugs and alcohol intake.
It has increased 12 kg of weight in recent months.
Physical examination was normal.
It provides a record of capillary blood glucose with hypoglycemia at any time of the day up to 17 mg/dl as the lowest figure.
On fasting blood tests performed in the first hour of the morning, the patient presented venous glycemia of 30 mg/dl with insulinemia and C-peptide not suppressed.
Given the findings, admission was decided, fasting test was performed which after 6 hours confirmed endogenous hyperinsulinism and the beginning of the localization study.
The patient underwent Somatostatin Receptor Stem Cell Scintigraphy, SPECT-CT, CT scan of the chest and abdomen, and ultrasound, which were normal.
An arteriography was performed after intra-arterial calcium administration, without catheterization of the gastroduodenal artery and in which there was an increase in insulinemia after stimulation of the superior mesenteric and splenic arteries.
Because of the absence of imaging findings, the study was extended with pancreatic MRI, CT angiography and CT with contrast of the abdomen, and repeated arteriography 3 months later with similar results.
Subsequently, 18-Fluor PET (DOPA) was performed, and no pathological image was found.
Finally, laparotomy was performed with confection, intra-operative pancreatic ultrasound and indiocyanine green, resecting two nodules analyzed by pathologists intraoperatively as non-pathological lymph nodes, and performing pancreatic biopsy.
Biopsy analysis showed pancreatic tissue with a slight increase in size and number of islots, compatible with B-islot hyperplasia.
No histological signs of malignancy.
Currently, the patient is waiting for a corporeal pancreatectomy but tolerance, with the diagnostic suspicion of non-insulinoma pancreatogenic hypoglycemia (adult nosidioblastosis); he is treated with diazoxide, with mild improvement in number and severity.
