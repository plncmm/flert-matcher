A 50-year-old senegalese woman has lived in Spain since 2008 and has been frequently travelling to her country of origin, an area with a high prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis.
The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin and glicazide, normal multinodular goiter, erosive gastritis with Helicobacter pylori, and a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus 609 IU (HBV, viral load).
She lives with people of African origin and had consumed unpasteurized milk.
During the last year the patient presented the following symptoms/signs: - Chronic migratory polyarthritis (predominant affection of ankles and sacrum).
Plantar fascia enteropathy with calcification at its insertion in the calcaneus.
- Previous Uveitis (2 episodes).
- Cephalea biparietal with associated▁parotid swelling.
Cranial computed tomography (CT) scan showed no relevant data.
- Pérrez de strengthen en el lower extremities, complaining of falls, hyperalgesia, apalesthesia, paraesthesia, malleolus oedema.
An electromyogram showed mixed sensory-motor polyneuropathy.
- erythematous annular plaque on the back of both feet,
- Pérrez de 6 kg de weight en elapsement dans les months.
He had no other risk factors for infections or toxic consumption.
He had a positive Quantiferon and Mantoux, the latter later became negative.
Analytically, the patient presented stasis, hypercalcemia, hypovitaminosis D and hypergammaglobulinemia.
Malnutrition or maladjustment data were not available.
Quantification of immunoglobulins was normal.
He had no paraprotein in blood or urine.
The 24-hour urine analysis was normal, including the determination of porphyrins.
The immunological study was normal.
She had elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (171 IU/L).
The chest X-ray was normal.
An abdominal CT scan showed a possible proliferative pathology of bone marrow in the vertebral bodies and in the iliac level, which was confirmed by MRI.
A chest CT scan showed multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathies, larger than 15 mm, subpleural nodules and areas of ground glass in the upper lobes.
All this led to a disseminated granulomatous disease in a natural patient from a country with high prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis and chronic HBV infection.
A skin biopsy was performed, which was reported as a non-necrotizing granulomatous disease.
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage -- without microbiological isolates and with an increase in CD4/CD8 -- ratio and FNAB of a submammary lymphadenopathy was performed.
The pathology of the adenopathy confirmed the presence of granulomatous non necrotizing disease, compatible with sarcoidosis.
Other causes such as cancer, autoimmune diseases or infections were ruled out; mainly disseminated tuberculosis with joint involvement (Poncet's disease).
Mycobacterium tuberculosis or leprae was not isolated in biopsies, nasal▁exudates and other biological fluids studied.
With the diagnosis of probable sarcoidosis, latent tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis due to HBV, she was treated with corticosteroids, disseminated tuberculosis and antiviral drugs.
Prophylaxis of▁coccidioidomycosis strercoralis was also performed.
