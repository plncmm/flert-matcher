▁Oncological History Presents the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian woman who was a bank director as a profession, with two sisters, married, living with her husband, and with a daughter in common life, independent for the activities.
There are no known allergies or toxic habits.
She is hypertensive on enalapril/ hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg. She does not take any other chronic medication except occasional paracetamol if needed for pain.
He has been operated on for more than 20 years from a multinodular goiter.
No other relevant pathological history was reported.
As a family history, her father was diagnosed with gastric cancer at 66 years and her mother of endometrial cancer at 48 years.
In June 2013 the patient was 65 years old with a supero-externe quadrant tumor of the right breast. A fluorescent probe was detected incidentally in routine mammogram (HER-2 positive) and a fluorescent probe was started.
Tumor markers at diagnosis were CEA 67.2 and Ca 15-3 108.7.
An extension study was carried out with several tests, highlighting the PET/CT, with multiple blastic bone metastases at the level of D7, D9, transverse apophysis of L4, S1, right iliac bone and femoral head.
With the diagnosis of breast ICD with positive receptors and HER-2 positive stage IV due to bone metastases, the patient started chemotherapy within the first line of treatment with paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and after October 2013, with appropriate tolerance.
The patient also received radiotherapy for bone metastases in the iliac and right femoral head (30 Gy each) in November 2013, despite which she had a pathological fracture of the right hip in December 2013 that was treated by cemented partial arthroplasty.
It received 6 cycles until February 2014, achieving partial response, after which paclitaxel was suspended and continued letrozole, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, until October 2014, ending by left deterioration.
Because of radiological bone progression, the patient starts a second line of treatment with MDD1 3.6 mg/kg every 21 days, which remains to date.
Anamn. The patient comes to second opinion in outpatient clinics with progressive nausea and vomiting. On July 29, 2016, the predominant febricula is vespertino associated with back-lumbar pain radiating to the right hip.
During the interview, she reported two previous admissions to different hospitals.
One of them, from May 30 to June 6, was diagnosed with Staphylococcus epidermis (SE) reservoir infection, treated with vancomycin and removed and discharged with ciprofloxacin for 4 days.
Due to the persistence of fever, she consulted on June 11 in another hospital, and cefixima was given for 7 days.
Given the clinical suspicion of OV, it was decided to request urgent laboratory tests, hemocultives (HC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which showed fracture in D9 and D10 with abundant edema in both vertebral bodies.
Given the severity of the situation, on August 8, 2016, admission was decided to start empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy and complete the study.
Physical examination upon arrival at the hospitalization ward revealed a haemodynamically stable condition and a tapering pattern, with no findings except for selective pain upon palpation at D9 and D10.
▁Complementary tests Laboratory at admission showed normal biochemical renal and hepatic function, highlighting an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) to 98.6 mg/l (normal: less than 1 mg/l) with procalcitonin.
The hemogram showed normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl, already known, with values of leukocytes and platelets within normal range, with leukocytes of 8,910 (normal values between 4,500 and 11,000).
During admission, the results of the HC were pending.
In addition to the aforementioned MRI, a chest X-ray was also performed, which showed no abnormalities of interest, as well as Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks and transthoracic ultrasound, aimed at screening for endocarditis, without pathological findings.
Diagnosis The patient was diagnosed with vertebral osteomyelitis D9-D10 by Staphylococcus epidermis.
Treatment of clinical and imaging data, empirical treatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was initiated based on previous SE isolates.
Serial HCs performed in our center confirmed the positivity of this microorganism, oxacillin-resistant, maintaining vancomycin for 15 days, with improvement of symptoms and subsequent discharge of continuous oral PCR reagents for 15 days.
The chronic peak is compatible process November 13, 2016, the patient consults for new patients up to 38.5oC, reason why is performed NRT, showing findings of persistence of O17 continue to be treated conservatively with endoscopic mucosal resection.
