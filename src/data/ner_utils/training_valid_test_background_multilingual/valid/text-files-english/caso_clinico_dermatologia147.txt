Anamnesis Female patient, 50 years old, born in Senegal with residence in Spain for 9 years, but with frequent trips to his country, who entered in charge of internal medicine to cause a total decrease of 2 months.
Relevant antecedents in the last year were: erosive gastritis with gastric ulcer associated ulcers; polyarthralgias migratory of large articu­lations without oral diabetes mellitus; two cases with non-diabetic uveitis
She also had a history of normal multinodular goiter pending thyroidectomy.
In the last months (not specified), he reported weight loss of 7-8 kg associated with asthenia, but not hypoxia, without associated fever or night sweats.
Physical examination revealed poor general health, with prostration due to pain in the lower limbs.
As for the constants, the patient was normotensive, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, a febricula of 37.6 or C, and basal oxygen saturation of 97%.
Physical examination revealed a recessive goiter in the right lobe, with no associated pain.
There was no hepatomegaly or palpable lymphadenopathy or accessible chain lymphadenopathy.
Neurological examination performed by▁Pneumology showed hyperalgesia in both lower limbs with apalesthesia in the forefoot (absence of fracture-distal mobility, tremor in lower limbs with alteration in the diagnosis).
The skin examination revealed the presence of two symmetrical plaques on the dorsum of both feet, contrasted with the non-hard skin type VI (dark) and brownish brownish brownish brown appearance on both feet.
▁Complementary laboratory tests were performed for diagnosis in which blood count and coagulation were within normal range, a biochemical test with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels of 171 IU/l (8-52), rheumatoid factor and negative autoantibodies.
As for microbiological analysis, the Mantoux test and QuantiFeron TB were positive, as well as serology for hepatitis B virus infection (inactive carrier).
The rest of the serologies were negative.
No bacilli were identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening, and contrast-enhanced chest CT identified multiple clavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathies, as well as a prepleural glass-coated infiltrate with alcohol.
The neurophysiological study of the lower limbs showed polyneuropathy of mixed axonal and demyelinating type, sensory-motor im­portant degree.
In addition, histological samples were taken from a paratracheal adenopathy and one of the cutaneous plates.
In the adenopathy was pre-adjuvanted epithelioid aggregated with histiocytes and a▁lymphoid population, without finding acid-resistant bacilli, compatible with lymphadenitis.
The skin biopsy showed in the dermis several small and well-defined granulomas,▁surrounded by large histiocytes, with multinucleated giant cells, patchy infiltrated and scarcely infiltrated.
There was no necrosis and Ziehl­Neelsen staining was negative.
Diagnosis Systemic sarcoidosis, in a patient with latent tuberculosis infection.
Treatment Started treatment with prednisone 40 mg/day with progressive clinical improvement.
In addition, tuberculous treatment and antiviral treatment with entecavir were initiated.
The evolution was clinically favorable after one week of systemic corticoid treatment, with improvement of the general▁malaise and neuropathy and disappearance of the febricula, which allowed the discharge of the patient for follow-up
The skin lesions had resolved one month after treatment.
