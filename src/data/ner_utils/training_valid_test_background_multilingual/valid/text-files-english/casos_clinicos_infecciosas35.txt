We report the case of a 64-year-old male patient, active smoker of 20 cigarettes/day since his youth, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia treated with loartan and simvastatin.
He came to the emergency room of another center referring right lumbar pain of two months of evolution that does not have his usual activity, until it is done abruptly more intensely and does not interfere with first step analgesia.
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious, oriented and cooperative, eupneic with basal oxygen saturation 98%, TA 190/112 mm/g, HR 83 bpm, and profane sweating.
Cardiopulmonary arrest normal.
The abdomen was blandom, but painful to palpation epigastric and right hypochondrium with abdominal defense.
In the emergency department an analytical was performed in which hemoglobin 13 g/dl, 10180 leukocytes/mm3 with 54.8% neutrophils, creatinine 0.99 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 29 mg/L, troponin 14 relevant.
Intravenous analgesic treatment was administered without symptomatic improvement, so abdominal ultrasound was requested in which an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6.6 cm was observed in the proximal segment without visualizing data of rupture.
The study was completed with a renal bifurcation associated with an abdominal CAT scan, in which a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm was observed with marked thickening of the aortic wall, internal displacement of the▁intimal calcifications, intramural hematoma and aneurysm 1 cm.
Given these findings, she was referred to our hospital for assessment of cardiac surgery and vascular surgery.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and after six days of admission she underwent surgery for abdominal aneurysm by programmed aortic by-pass and common iliac to the celiac trunk.
As a complication, both renal arteries are▁resected and a sample of the aortic wall is taken for culture due to the presence of abnormal periaortic inflammatory tissue.
The patient has a complicated postoperative period with hemodynamic instability despite treatment with vasoactive drugs and, due to anuria and suspicion of bladder injury, an ultrasound is performed and subsequently an abdominal CT scan that showed, in addition to the post-surgical renal defect, a bilateral renal collection.
The patient begins with continuous venous hemostasis and after recovering hemodynamic stability intermittent hemodialysis was started.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 68%, without abnormalities in▁contractility, with displacement of the left atrium by the descending aorta aneurysm without other changes.
An acute phase reactants and clinical signs of infection are analytically produced, so samples for empirical microbiology treatment are extracted (i.e., broad spectrum antibiotics, culture of tracheal aspirate, and urine culture response).
All cultures were negative except for aortic wall culture taken by the surgeon in which Staphylococcus lugdunensis was isolated, so treatment with cloxacillin i.v. was started.
(2 g every 8 hours) according to the antibiogram.
Differential diagnosis In summary, this is a 64-year-old male with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissecting aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, isolated in cultured aortic wall of S. lugdunensis.
This microorganism is found in human skin and is a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci, but shares similarity with Staphylococcus aureus due to its high virulence and ability to produce suppurative infections.
It is a rare contaminant (<20%), and usually present in patients with immunosuppression or some underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, surgery or previous trauma.
Clinically, they present persistent fever (>80%), bacteremia (associated anemia (81%), and sepsis (in more than a third of cases).
It is a pathogen responsible for both nosocomial and community infections and has been associated with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, central nervous system abscesses and soft tissue infections.
In infective endocarditis, the overall mortality is between 18 and 38.8%, higher than those caused by S. aureus (22%) and the rest of coagulase-negative staphylococci (16%).
In the etiological evaluation of aortic aneurysm, clinical history and radiological images are essential.
The degenerative aneurysm without rupture is usually asymptomatic and its risk factors are mainly advanced age, male sex, hypertension and smoking.
These factors are shared for both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, although in the former the presence of genetic (Marfan's disease), infectious or inflammatory factors is more frequent.
The most common location is infrarenal, and there is no association between inflammatory findings on CT.
The findings suggesting aneurysm infection are: saccular or multilobulated aneurysm, inflammation of the periaortic tissue, presence of intramural air or in a periaortic collection or perivascular collection.
When we meet these findings, we must think that there has been an infection of a predetermined degenerative aneurysm.
Inflammatory aortic aneurysm is characterized by thickening of the adventitia, with an inflammatory ring greater than 1 cm around the aorta in which the intensity may increase with intravenous contrast and extends to retroperitoneal inflammatory fibrosis.
Therefore, in the presence of any of these characteristics, a different etiology from degenerative one should be considered.
Aortic stenosis is the affectation of the aortic wall regardless of its cause.
The clinical presentation is nonspecific, with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, acute coronary syndrome or abdominal pain.
Basically, they differ in two types: inflammatory (infectious and non-infectious) and non-inflammatory.
Among the infectious causes are those produced by bacteria (Salmonella spp.
and S. aureus, the most common cause 40% of cases; Lis conscious, Baccoidos HIV.gilis, Clostridium septicum and Campylobacter jejuni), tuberculosis, syphilis, or viruses such as tuberculosis
They usually affect a segment already injured with plaques of arteriosus or atherosclerotic plaques and spread by contiguity or septic emboli (in sepsis or infective endocarditis).
Cardiac arrest during admission to the ICU was able to stabilize the patient hemodynamically, extubation was achieved and after three weeks of antibiotic therapy directed with cloxacillin, the patient was discharged to the operating room.
On arrival, we consulted to assess the duration of antibiotic treatment.
When we performed the first assessment, we found a patient with good general condition, analytical distress, hemodynamically stable, spontaneous breathing without requiring surgical treatment, and no sequelae after ICU admission, and no signs of wound infection.
We reviewed the medical history and the patient reported a two-month history of low back pain, without interfering with his daily life that he was on paracetamol until the day that sudden pain appeared in the emergency department.
He had not had fever at any time, chills, weight loss, or other symptoms.
In the initial laboratory analysis there was no increase in acute phase reactants and, as there was no fever, there were no hemocultives prior to post-surgical infectious complications.
At this moment we raise a question: Is S. lugdunensis really the cause of aneurysm rupture, or is it part of 20% of the percentage of contaminants?
In any case, since the germ was isolated from sterile biological material, we completed up to six weeks of antibiotic treatment with cefazolin 1 g daily i.v., given its efficacy and convenience of administration in hemodialysis patients
Final diagnosis Objectively we are in a patient with a cardiovascular complication and a nonspecific clinical presentation, suspected infectious nature according to the surgical findings and negative, but without fever, so we request a serology of endocarditis.
The results were as follows: Bartonella (Ig G and Ig M negative), syphilis (EIA negative, Coxi3276g positive Ig M8, Ig G phase I > 1:32768, I weak phase II).
We requested the amplification and detection of bacterial DNA from the microorganism in blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which was negative (performed in the Reference Institute of Health Carlos III de Ma).
Aortic tissue was not available for PCR or immunohistochemistry.
The final result was rupture of abdominal aneurysm with chronic infection due to Q fever.
Treatment was initiated with methotrexate (100 mg/12 hours) plus hydroxychloroquine adjusted for renal function (200 mg/12 hours) after normal examination of the eye fundus.
Cardiac Surgery decided to postpone the intervention on the thoracic aneurysm in order to see the evolution of renal function and plan the most appropriate technique.
Two months later, the patient died in another hospital due to shock, and neither CT nor necropsy studies were performed.
