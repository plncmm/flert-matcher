She was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without treatment on admission; without personal or family history of heart disease, history of heart failure, or sudden death.
The patient was seen in the emergency room of our center due to progressive dyspnea on exertion, until reaching a minimum level of effort (less than 5 meters) in the last year.

Coagulation: INR 1.43, PTTA 29.5.

Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly to a dilated right cavities.
Signs of vascular stenosis and fluid in a minor fissure
Serologies: Toxoplasma, Echinococcus, Trypanosoma, Treponema authenticdum, stercoralis, Schistosoma negative.
Paracoccidioidomycosis in peripheral blood was negative.
Plasmodium IgM negative and IgG 1:80 (recent infection).
Trichinella, Fasciola, Taenia negative.
HIV negative.
IgM negative AHA with positive total A.
HBV: HBcAc positive, anti-HBe indeterminate and anti-HBs positive.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: fibrosis endomyocardial infarction VI.
Severe LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF 20% and restrictive diastolic pattern.
Low cardiac output.
Dilated RV, hypocontractile with 11 mm TAPSE, with no clear image of apical occupation.
She had mild left atrial dilatation and AD.
Mild functional MR.
Severe functional IT.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
I digest right retroauricular pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary CT angiography and cardiac CT: minimal focal repletion defect in the posterior basal segmental branch and lateral subsegmental of the RLL, compatible with chronic peripheral artery.
Cardiomegaly with signs of right heart failure.
Atheromatosis in aortic arch and coronary arteries.
Increased fat density in the middle▁mediastinum does not individualize the esophageal wall, nonspecific.
Coronary angiography: 1-vessel coronary artery disease.
Anterior descending with critical ostial lesion, diffusely ill vessel with limit caliber and distal flow 2.
The apical portion is filled by homocoronary circulation from the epicardial vessel coming from the circumflector.
EVOLUTION The patient was admitted to the cardiology unit due to heart failure with a right-sided onset, FC III/IV NYHA; the object was restrictive echocardiography compatible with severe RV fibrosis and LV diastolic hypertension associated with systolic dysfunction VI.
Depletive treatment was initiated with good response and progressive titration of neurohormonal treatment (bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 hours, ramipryl 5 mg/24 hours, eplerenone 25 mg/24 hours).
Pulmonary artery angio-CT was requested with a chronic diagnosis of pulmonary artery stenosis and a thoracic CT scan was performed to assess the extent of the endomyocardial fibrosis, with absence of endomyocardial calcification, objectivy coronary atheromatosis.
Coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease of the anterior descending artery with critical ostial lesion, visualizing a diffusely ill vessel of borderline caliber.
Infections were detected as an ethiopathogenic factor of endomyocardial fibrosis.
Given the characteristics of the patient, absence of angina, LV dysfunction secondary to endomyocardial fibrosis, is associated with medical treatment already established AAS and statins and the case is presented in endoscopic surgical session (endomyocardial resection).
It is rejected for mass resection surgery and revascularization of the LA due to high surgical risk.
Oral anticoagulation is not initiated due to an important idiomatic barrier and a high risk of treatment noncompliance.
During follow-up, the patient did not attend outpatient follow-up.
DIAGNOSIS Cardiac failure debuts in relation to cardiomyopathy caused by restrictive endomyocardial fibrosis VI.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism.
Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Ischemic heart disease.
Coronary artery disease of 1 vessel, with no clinical signs of angina.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
