Clinical history and anamnesis We present a 17-year-old male with a history of primary hypercoagulability due to heterozygous mutation of the prothrombin gene and the homocysteine gene, who had an episode of thrombosis in the sinus 6 years.
Ten years ago he had presented with a clinical picture of almost continuous oral ulcers, two episodes of genital ulcers in this period, pruritus and redness of the free edge of both eyelids and liquid stools (3 times per day).
She was diagnosed with prurigo due to acneiform lesions with residual tricles.
In September 2013, the patient came to the emergency room for skin lesions that began on the inner side of the left thigh and spread distally, ruling out venous thrombosis.
In addition, she had intermittent episodes of self-limiting peripheral arthralgia, asthenia and fever, with weight loss of about 3 kg in the last months.
The patient was referred from the enteropathology service and to Internal Medicine consultations on January 8, 2014 to rule out a possible Behçet's disease, where general laboratory tests, CT study of autoimmunity, immunodeficiency
The patient had a hard and firm tumor on the anterolateral side of the neck, suspecting as a first possibility adenopathy to rule out▁lymphoproliferative syndrome.
The patient came to the emergency service on January 9, for a cervical tumor 48 hours after a cough that is increasing in size.
On physical examination, dysphonia and cervical tumor in the left anterolateral pulsatile region, two oral aphthous lesions in the tongue and internal face of the lower lip were observed.
I'm back without findings.
An image compatible with a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior wall of the left common carotid artery (ICAC) of dimensions 28x28x26 mm was observed after urgent cervical ultrasound, which was also confirmed as a prominent venous soft tissue angio-CT in the posterior structures.
After the results of these imaging tests, the patient is transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where on day 10 angiography is performed, showing chronic occlusion of the superior longitudinal sinus with great development of collateral venous circulation.
Giant pseudoaneurysm (7-8 cm long with a narrow neck of about 8 mm) and severe stenosis of the ICCA in relation to its spontaneous dissection.
Two sealant stents were placed plus endoaneurysmal trombin injection, with result of partial seal of the same in the subsequent control with Angio-CT.
On day 15, the patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward.
▁Complementary tests Complete blood biochemistry was requested with normal results including ESR, PCR was 77.4 mg/L, blood count with leukocytosis of 15.410 with neutrophilia of 82.4%, thyroid hormones and elemental iron normal serum levels.
In addition, serology for Chlamydia, Hepatitis B and C Virus, Mycoplasma, HIV, CMV, EBV IgM and Syphilis were requested, resulting negative with EBV IgG positive and EBV IgM negative.
Proteinogram with albumin/globulin ratio 0.7, slight increase of alpha, beta and gamma-globulins and increase of immunoglobulins (Ig G 1944.9 mg/dL, Ig A 581.10 mg/dL normal complement) C
Tumor markers were normal except for Ankylosing C.A.
125 of 55.9 U/ml.
Genetic testing for HLA B51 was negative.
Differential diagnosis The diagnosis of Behçet's disease is exclusively clinical, there are no laboratory tests, autoantibodies or specific histological findings, so we must exclude other processes that justify the different symptoms of the patient requiring another management.
According to the revised classification criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease (2006), 3 points or more are needed to establish the diagnosis of Behçet's disease, the patient had oral and genital ulcers, obtaining aphthous classification.
We must rule out large vessel vasculitis such as Takayasu's arteritis where there is no venous involvement and in the case of our patient did not meet criteria, in the case of advanced giant cell arteritis with bilateral adenopathy and GSV must appear in children
Recurrent polychondritis includes ocular, joint and cutaneous involvement, with vascular involvement in the form of aneurysms appearing, but our patient had no chondral involvement.
We can think of Hughes-Stovin syndrome due to a history of venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, but the presence of pulmonary aneurysms was ruled out.
In the case of vascular Ehl-Danlos vascular ruptures occur vascular pseudoaneurysms and perforations without presenting frequent venous hyperlaxity and prominent wound healing, with no apparent changes in wound healing, after a
It also usually has a typical facies.
The definitive diagnosis is based on heterozygous mutation in COL3A1 and COL3A2 genes.
We could think of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), non-erosive arthritis, skin involvement, oral aphthous ulcers, gastrointestinal disorders, thrombosis and vasculitis.
According to the new diagnostic criteria for SLICC (systemic Lupus International Conservative Clinics), our patient only has oral aphthous ulcers and synovitis, without meeting four criteria (immune aphthous).
Sarcoidosis is associated with anterior uveitis, arthritis, skin disorders, hypergammaglobulinemia, but the venous system is not affected and our patient had no typical pulmonary involvement.
Clinical judgement and outcome The patient was diagnosed with Behçet's disease with orogenital aphthous ulcers, anterior ocular involvement without hypopion, acneiform skin lesions, probable gastrointestinal arthralgia ICA, and pseudo-neurism.
During his stay in the plant the evolution was favorable, with fever secondary to superficial phlebitis venous access with negative hemocultives.
The patient presented with hemoptoic sputum, discarding pulmonary arteriovenous fistula and pulmonary artery aneurysms by new emergency chest angio-CT, which showed an image of infectious or inflammatory tenuous▁bronchiolitis.
On January 17, a new arteriography was performed with placement of a PTF endoprosthesis and seal of the pseudoaneurysm with minimal leak, confirming spontaneous thrombosis on a control Doppler ultrasound.
After initiating boluses of 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone in three doses and continuing with 60 mg/24h oral prednisone, the general condition improved, disappearing the general clinical and hemoptoic expectoration.
The steroid cycle was consolidated with the first dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide (mg) on January 20, without incidents.
Five more sessions of cyclophosphamide were completed on an outpatient basis. Currently the patient is being treated with azathioprine 50 mg/12h, double antiplatelet therapy with dagregin 75 mg and aspirin 100mgt, and
