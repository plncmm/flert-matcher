Anamnesis 33-year-old male, smoker, severe exbedor, occasional cocaine user, with a history of fatty liver disease, gynecomastia associated with genital fatty liver disease, herpes zoster oft
He came to the Neurology outpatient clinic complaining of a progressive picture of 2 weeks of evolution of proximal weakness in the upper limbs, paresthesias and pain in the lower limbs, dysphonia and dysphagia for liquids.
He did not complain of fever, headache, weight loss, insect bites, joint inflammation or sphincter alterations.
Physical examination The vital signs were within normal limits, and the general physical examination was normal, except for whitish lesions in the oral mucosa.
In the neurological examination, the upper functions were preserved.
Speech was dysphonic.
Normal confrontation campimetry.
Isochoric and normoreactive hairs to light.
Eye mobility preserved, no nystagmus, with dubious left ptosis.
On examination, the rest of the cranial nerves were normal.
Muscle system: at the level of the right upper limb had marked paresis (3/5) associated with ipsilateral shoulder, minimal weakness in the biceps and extensor muscles of the third and fourth fingers (4+5).
At the level of the left upper limb stood out a (4 +/5) shoulder paresis and a (4/5) paresis for the thumb with evident tenar eminence of that hand flexion.
In the lower limbs paresis (4/5) was observed for psoas and quadriceps.
Tricipital osteotendinous reflexes and lower limb reflexes were abolished.
Cutaneous-plantar bilateral flexor contracture.
Fasciculations in the right shoulder
Hypoesthesia at the level of the lateral aspect of the left thigh, right arm and both feet.
Coordination and gait were unchanged.
Additional tests • Normal blood count and coagulation
Normal biochemistry except GOT 113 IU/l, GPT 770 IU/l, GGT 97 IU/l.
Thyroid hormones were normal.
VSG 67 mm/h.
Urine analysis: leukocyturia and negative nitrites.
• Anti-nDNA, antimitochondrial, smooth muscle, anti-LKM1, ANCA and ANA antibodies negative.
Proteinogram and complement were normal.
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): 2 leukocytes, ÷¥s, proteins, glucose and ADA without alterations.
▁Cytology, CSF culture and B-K Lowestein showed no abnormalities.
• Serology: HIV positive, cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG (+) IgM (–– Epburgh virus), Mycoplasma pneumoniae simpler IgM (–), Bruxella IgG (+) virus (–)
HCV and HBV serologies were negative.
• positive CMV PCR in blood and CSF.
Enterovirus, ESR 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, DM negative.
HIV viral load in serum 1,840 copies/ml.
• Cellular immunity: CD4 92.8/mm3, CD8 284.2/mm3.
• Complete cerebral and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): no significant findings.
• Electroneurography: findings compatible with multiple mononeuropathy, left ulnar motor neuropathy and degenerative neuropathy in the forearm.
Decrease in motor amplitudes of more than 50% of the left nerve with respect to the right and posterior tibial and peroneal nerves left, median rights with respect to left, median rights with respect to palliative care.
• Electromyography: recent active denervation data in all muscles explored (left and right gastrocnemius, right anterior tibial and vastus lateralis).
Diagnosis Multiple mononeuritis.
HIV infection stage B3.
Treatment Regimen
Following a decrease in CMV viral load, maintenance treatment with valganvir 900 mg/12 h orally was initiated.
Specific HIV treatment was initiated with emtricitabine 200 mg/24 h, 245 mg/24 h, durunavir 800 mg/24 h and ritonavir 100 mg/24 h. Tenofovir was re-diagnosed as a re-motivation.
On the other hand, during the study of the clinical picture presented a progressive and rapid clinical deterioration in a few days, experiencing a marked progression of weakness and sensitivity in the four limbs.
The evolution after 6 months was partial recovery.
Proximally the lower and distal limbs in the upper limbs presented paresis of 4/5 and impossibility of flexion or flexure of the right shoulder.
The neurophysiological control study showed a moderate partial lesion of the right axillary, left median, left cubital, left radial, right tibial and peroneal nerves, as well as normal or mild partial nerve injury in the rest of the patients.
At the functional level, after 6 months of rehabilitation, the patient still needed help to dress the upper part of the body, was able to eat without help, had no gait limitations, or sphincter problems.
