We report the case of a 32-year-old man without known drug allergies, with the only personal history of polyarticular rheumatism in childhood.
She was admitted to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left hemithorax, which did not change with respiratory movements, postural changes, without cough or dyspnea, and without other accompanying symptoms.
Physical examination revealed a small nonspecific right laterocervical adenopathy, with hepatomegaly of about 3 cm from the costal margin, with no other relevant findings.
Presenting the following complementary tests: BACY COMPLEMENTARY PRUEBAS CBC and peripheral blood smears: hemoglobin 13.3 g/dl, platelets 281,000/ul, glycosylated lymphocytes 1%,
Biochemistry: Creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, Urea 52 mg/dl, (creatinine clearance 59 ml/min), total protein 10.8 g/dl, total calcium 9.8 mg/dl, normal rest.
Proteinogram: monoclonal peak in gamma band.
Coagulation: APTT 33.6 seconds, INR 1.35.
Basic urine culture: Positive protein with presence of mucin in the sediment.
Chest X-ray: Small nodular image calcified in the left lower lobe, probable calcified granuloma.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES ESPECIES Indigenous People-Immunophenotype in peripheral blood: 45% of total white blood cell count has an abnormal immunophenotype CD45+, CD3879+,
Bone marrow aspirate: Presence of plasma cells in a proportion of 50% of the total cellularity, heterogeneous in size, predominantly intermediate-sized elements.
Common binucleated and trinucleated cells.
Bone marrow biopsy: Multifocal interstitial collagen of the medullary parenchyma due to plasmatic cells stimulus IG-Kappa.
Medullary Plasmocytosis is 40-50%.
Amyloid material was negative.
Beta2-microglobulin: 7.3 mg/dl.
Bone series: No evidence of osteolytic lesions.
Serum immunoelectrophoresis: IgG 4.390 mg/dl, IgA 14.5 mg/dl, IgM 4.17 mg/dl.
Serum immunofixation: Paraprotein IgG-Kappa.
Urine immunoelectrophoresis: Proteinuria of light chains (Bence-Jones) of 1.310 mg in 24 hours, for IgG-Kappa paraprotein and free Kappa light chains.
Serology HBV, HCV, HIV: negative.
Abdominal ultrasound: Hepatomegaly without focal hepatosplenic lesions.
There is no evidence of intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or free intraperitoneal fluid, rest without alterations.
Diagnosis: The patient presents a clinical picture compatible with a multiple myeloma in his variant primary plasma cell leukemia.
Treatment: Given the patient's age, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation was decided.
Induction chemotherapy was initiated with the C-VAD regimen.
