A 39-year-old male, 170 cm in height and 65 kg in weight.
Among the antecedents there is a Hodgkin lymphoma at 5 years of age that required resection, liver biopsy and mesenteric▁ganglia for staging and that was treated with radiotherapy on the▁thorax.
At 34 years of age he underwent hemithyroidectomy for follicular adenoma.
He was previously asymptomatic and had an active life. He came to the emergency room for two days of evolution with general▁malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, vomiting, diarrhea and fever.
Blood tests showed mild leukocytosis.
Abdominal ultrasound, thoracic and lumbar plain radiology revealed no abnormalities.
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.
The patient was diagnosed with low back pain and discharged.
Three days later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room due to worsening of the condition with thiritone, fever of 40 ̊C and hypotension.
Blood tests revealed 34.8 × 103 leukocytes/μL (92% neutrophils and 15% falls), platelets 465 × 103/μL, ESR 40 mm, creatinine 1.55 mg/dL, procalcitonin 6.dL
Bacteriuria, 5-10 leucocytes/field and oxalate crystals were observed in the urinary sediment.
Hemocultive and uroculture were extracted.
With the suspicion of severe sepsis not affiliated, rescue fluid therapy was administered and antibiotic treatment with meropenem and linezolid was initiated.
Two days after admission, the patient developed dyspnea at rest and pulmonary edema, probably related to intravenous fluid intake, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
On electrocardiogram, a second-degree AV block progressed to complete AV block with exit at 70 bpm.
Transesophageal echocardiography detected moderate tricuspid insufficiency, mild mitral insufficiency and normal functioning aortic valve, as well as mobile images suggestive of vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet.
Dopamine infusion was started to maintain heart rate, and when infective endocarditis was suspected, antibiotic treatment was modified with cloxacillin, daptomycin and gentamicin.
The patient's evolution was favorable and extubation was possible 6 days after admission.
After 10 days of admission, the patient presented with retroactive pain and signs of sudden onset pericarditis.
Echocardiography showed mild pericardial effusion and progression of endocarditis with vegetations on the anterior mitral leaflet, septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and mitral-aortic junction without significant valve regurgitation.
Computed tomography angiography showed an aneurysm of probable fungal origin in the anterior face of the ascending aorta as well as thoracic aorta and small pulmonary artery.
The patient underwent emergency surgery.
After opening the pericardium, the pericardial fluid was bleeding and sent for culture.
Although subjectively▁appreciated, the aorta, vena cavae and pulmonary artery appeared to be very small for the size of the patient in the surgical team.
A hematoma was observed on the anterior face of the aorta and on the fat pad of the right ventricle.
It was cannulated and then proceeded to debrid the hematoma draining abundant pus followed by active arterial bleeding due to possible rupture of the mycotic aneurysm.
Once the extracorporeal circulation was connected and the aorta was clamped, the ascending aorta was opened, abundant with atheromatous plaques, a small mycotic valve with signs of inflammation and a small annular aortic valve with competent aneurysm 16 mm.
A vegetation anchored to the septum medulla was observed below the aortic valve and▁resected.
A Teflon-reinforced suture was placed after pincelling the septum with povidone-iodine upon suspicion of communication with the right atrium.
The portion of the aortic wall that included the mycotic aneurysm was▁resected and the aorta was directly closed respecting the aortic valve.
A right auricularotomy was performed, observing a large vegetation in the commissure between the anterior leaflet and the septal one, probably related to the▁resected vegetation on the left ventricular face.
Vegetation was▁resected, painted with Betadine and the commissure was reinforced with a suture.
Then the atrial septum was opened and a large vegetation was observed on the anterior mitral leaflet that was▁resected.
At the end of the intervention, a definitive epicardial pacemaker was implanted over the right ventricle.
Hemocultive and urocultive were negative.
The pericardial fluid culture was positive for S. pneumoniae.
Although the culture of the vegetations was negative, the DNA study by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for S. pneumoniae in all samples.
The postoperative evolution of the patient was initially favorable in echocardiogram normal functioning valves without residual shunts.
However, 3 weeks after the intervention the patient suffered progressive deterioration of the general condition with fever and hypotension.
Several blood cultures were positive for Candida orthopsilosis.
Despite antifungal treatment, the patient died due to septic shock and multiple organ failure two months after surgery.
Invasive candidiasis was observed in liver and lung in the autopsy study.
