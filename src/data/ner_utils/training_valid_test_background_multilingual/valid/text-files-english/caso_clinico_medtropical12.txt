Personal history: no cardiovascular risk factors were detected.
In his childhood, he returned to a rural Ecuadorian zone.
Episode of arrhythmia in his home country with unknown diagnosis and treatment.
Hermanus with probable diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia.Analysis (biochemistry, blood count and coagulation) showed no alterations of interest.
▁Myocardial damage markers were negative.
ECG: sinus rhythm with ischemia in the facelateral.
Frequent ventricular extrasystole.
Echocardiogram: Dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, severe hypokinesia of inferoposterior face and apical aneurysm.
Emergence therapy: beta-blocker treatment.
It performs 10 minutes of Bruce protocol.
Maximum frequency 132 bpm (75% theoretical maximum frequency).
It stops with dyspnea without symptoms of angina or ST depression. It presents frequent ventricular extrasystoles unrelated to exercise.
Telemetry: abundant ventricular tachycardias (NSVT) and idioventricular rhythm (VASR) were detected.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: left ventricle dilated, EF 35%.
Decreased thickness of the myocardiac wall in the inferolateral, apical and medial segments of the▁anterolateral segment with akinesia in these segments and apex dyskinesia.
Transmural contrast enhancement (gadolinium) in inferolateral medial and partially anterolateral segments.
Non-viable myocardium secondary to chronic infarction.
Coronary angiography: No coronary artery lesions were detected.
Ev.▁~~~ The patient, being followed up in external cardiology consultations, is clinically stable.
In September 2007, the patient was admitted for acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVA) in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, which was fibrinolytic and had no complications.
