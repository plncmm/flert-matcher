Anamnesis A 21-year-old man, with no relevant past medical history, came to the emergency department of our center complaining of a short 4-day history of fever, pharyngeal pain and right odynophagia, together with mild cutaneous lesions.
Two weeks before she had experienced a fever episode, without other symptoms, self-limiting in a few days.
Also, one week before the current episode, he had been seen in the emergency room for swelling and pain in the right ankle without previous trauma, which had been diagnosed by traumatologists as sprain, and which resolved spontaneously.
The patient denied dysuria, urethral secretion, arthralgias outside those that presented with ankle pain or testicular swelling.
She reported having had sexual relations only with a steady partner in the last three months.
The emergency department, which provisionally diagnosed the cutaneous lesions of follicosis, requested an assessment by pathology.
Physical examination The patient had a temperature of 37.5oC.
A purpuric pustule of 9 mm in diameter was observed on the volar side of the fifth finger of the left hand.
There were also pustular lesions▁surrounded by erythematous halo on the right side, the largest of which was an indurated nodule of about 2 centimeters in the twin zone, of pustulous center.
A slight pharyngeal hyperemia was observed in the mucosal examination.
No other skin or nail lesions were detected.
The rest of the physical examination was normal.
Blood tests showed no abnormalities except for a C-reactive protein of 85 mg/L.
Since skin lesions and history suggested a systemic infectious picture, echocardiography, blood, urine, pharynx cultures and digital pustule content were requested, and a larger biopsy of the lesion of the right was performed.
Echocardiography revealed no abnormalities.
The biopsy showed a dense neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue, as well as edema of the papillary dermis, without signs of vasculitis or septic emboli.
Cultures were negative, except for the pharyngeal one, in which Neisseria gonorrhoeae grew.
Diagnosis Disseminated gonorrhea infection.
Treatment Initially, empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was started, with fever disappearance within 24 hours.
Once ƒla aetiology was confirmed, and after clinical improvement, 400 mg cefiximab was switched to oral cefiximab every 12 hours until 10 days of treatment were completed.
Symptoms and skin lesions resolved completely with treatment.
