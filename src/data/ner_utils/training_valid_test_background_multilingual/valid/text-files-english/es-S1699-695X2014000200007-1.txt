This is a 22-year-old, asthenician, pale and thin male who repeatedly attends our health center's office in the last month due to postprandial epigastric pain associated with vomiting.
Episodes have been present for 7 years, reason why he has consulted the emergency services on multiple occasions, without ever having found acute pathology.
He was admitted 3 years ago for one of these episodes, performing a gastric biopsy showing positive gastric infection for H. pylori. He was treated with current triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and alienate negative.
Due to persistence of symptoms, treatment with antiemetics and multiple proton pump inhibitors was instituted, with no long-term response.
On admission, the patient was assessed by the Mental Health Service, since the symptoms of acute pain persisted and he was on vomiting, being diagnosed with anxiety-depressive syndrome with poor follow-up and therapeutic non-compliance.
She had no food or drug allergies.
Currently, the pain was in a genupectoral position and with cannabis consumption.
On physical examination we found a patient with stable constants, with a BMI of 17.7.
The abdomen is lying flat,▁tympanic, bl, and slightly painful to achieve deep fixation. There are no masses, adenopathies or enlargements.
The laboratory tests showed no alterations; absence of anemia, negative inflammatory response markers, no liver alterations or electrolyte disturbances, total protein 5.8 g/dl (normal value 6.4 to 8.3 g/dL).
Abdominal X-ray showed no signs of intestinal obstruction.
In our consultation, a total abdominal ultrasound was performed in the supine position, with no evidence of relevant findings. As we consulted the patient for all kinds of compression i.e., continuous compression i.e., endoscopic▁retrograde gastrointestinal tract, no more
Because of this finding, an abdominal CT angiography was performed, resulting in a vascular clamp that produced compression of the duodenum in its third portion.
The pinch mes affected the duodenum and the left renal vein, producing pre- and post-compression compression and dilatation.
