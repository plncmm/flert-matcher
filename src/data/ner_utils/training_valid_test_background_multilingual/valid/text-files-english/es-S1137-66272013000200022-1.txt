A 33-year-old patient with no history of interest was diagnosed with ileal Crohn's disease in early 2005.
She was treated with carnoseral 500 mg/8h and azathioprine at a dose of 150 mg/day since December 2005 for corticoid dependence.
He was also receiving oral iron in quarterly tandems, monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 and folic acid two days a week.
Since then the patient was asymptomatic.
In January 2007, an increase in the number of enzymes responsible for stasis was observed. This meant that the outpatient study could be expanded and azathioprine was withdrawn.
Personal hygiene: arterial hypertension: 100/60 mm/sec; PAGE: 70 bpm; Temperature: 36oC; Weight: 80 kg; Talla: 180 cm; Good general condition.
Aware and oriented.
Cardiopulmonary arrest normal.
The abdomen was blushing, depressible, painless, non-masses, or enlarged.
Lower extremities were normal.
Persistence of stasis is realized: Analytical.
Blood count and coagulation were normal.
Platelets: 108,000/ml.
Hepatic profile: Transaminase normal.
FA: 248U/L.
GGT: 390U/L.
Ferricus profile and autoimmunity were negative.
Serology was negative for hepatitis B and C virus.
Abdominal ultrasound.
Diffusely enlarged liver with smooth contour and diffusely tosque parenchyma, heterogeneous and hyperechogenic, without occupational lesions.
Pathologic gynecomastia
Normal door opening and permeability.
Rest of structures without alterations.
Abdominal MRI.
Diffusely enlarged liver, smooth contour and homogeneous hyperparenchyma in the T1 sequences of medium level, in the T2 sequences appears hypointense, with diffuse, discreet occupational patchy areas.
Pathologic gynecomastia
Rest of structures without alterations.
Gastroscopy.
In the lower third of the esophagus, three small varicose cords disappear with non-sinusitis.
The persistence of stasis to the biliary tract despite removal of the cystothioprine was decided to perform a liver biopsy in which a preserved general architecture was observed.
Some portal spaces are widened with incomplete port-portal bridge.
Isolated centrilobular veins.
No stasis or stenosis was observed.
No macrophages.
PAS diastase positive.
Some portal spaces present a slight round cell infiltrate that does not overflow the limiting plate.
The trabeculae of irregular hepatocytes show a pattern in regenerative zones and in pavement zones.
There are frequent binucleated cells and vascular structures with a pelitic pattern.
An irregular reticulin frame with collapsed areas was observed.
The histology described above is compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia.The subsequent evolution, both analytical and data of portal hypertension, was good with normal analytical and disappearance of esophageal varices.
