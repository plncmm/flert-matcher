A 19-year-old man, who had been in the bedroom of a popular holidays, was referred to our department for ten hours from another primary care center with left▁orbital trauma due to a bull▁horn.
The initial examination showed an incisive wound in the superior▁orbital rim (superior attachment) sutured in the hospital of origin and a penetrating wound (skinned) with an aberrant edges of the left eyelid hernia.
The largest diameter of the entrance orifice measured 1.7 cm and approximately 1.5 cm deep from the▁orbital rim.
A thorough examination of the wound was performed and the integrity of the ocular globe with normal ophthalmoscopy was confirmed.
The wound was thoroughly washed with povidone iodine diluted in saline in a 1:2 ratio.
Debridement of herniated fatty tissue and primary closure of the wound were performed.
Computed tomography (CT) showed a left▁orbital roof fracture.
A booster dose of diphtheria toxoid was prescribed, together with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours and clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours.
Four days after the trauma, the patient developed tumefaction with▁exudate, limitation of supraduction and inferior displacement of the eyeball.
Regardless of whether the origin was infectious or inflammatory, samples were taken for culture of▁exudates margin of the wound, vancomycin was the best intracranial dressing regimen IV every 12 hours to cover the potential Staphylococcus aureus resistant strain 1 gram.
Systemic corticosteroids were administered in descending order.
Colonies of Staphylococcus epidermis sensitive to almost all antibiotics tested in the antibiogram probably constituted a contaminant of the sample.
CT revealed thickening of the superior rectus muscle and soft tissues in relation to the inflammatory process with displacement of the eyeball.
The patient presented satisfactory recovery, presenting 2 months later, a visual acuity without unity correction, normal ocular motility and normal mental tension and 12 mm Hg ocular tension.
