Anamnesis Female 39 years, with no known drug allergies or medical history of interest.
Contraceptive patch as sole treatment.
He came to the hospital with a sudden onset of sensation of right hemilingual shortening and dysphagia, accompanied by a right handgrip on the right ala and on the first two fingers.
No association was found between loss of strength or language or vision impairment.
She did not report accompanying headache.
One week before, he had been submitted to cervical stretching maneuvers for a "cervical contracture".
Pathological fixation: conscious and oriented in the three.
Language: fluid, understand, name and repeat.
Dysarthria.
Cholesterols and normoreactive.
Normal external ocular movements.
No campimetric alterations.
No diplopia.
▁Right supranuclear facial paralysis and right facial hypoesthesia.
Hypophonia.
Paralysis of the XII right cranial nerve.

A negative Romberg with normal gait.
NIHSS = 2.
Lived erythematous plaques on the feet and faces of a yellowish appearance impressive with livedo reticularis.
Normal general examination.
▁Complementary tests: arterial saturation: 160/98 mmHg; heart rate: 108 bpm; O2 99%.
Afebril.
• Analytical: blood count, biochemistry, thyroid hormones, homocysteine, normal lipid and renal pattern.
• Serology: hepatitis B and Brucella negative.
Borrelia: initially positive (IgG + IgM) without further confirmation in cerebrospinal fluid or serum.
• Immunological study: anticardiolipin, antinuclear, anti-DNA, ANCA,▁cryoglobulins and lupus anticoagulant antibodies: negative.
• Thrombophilia study: negative.
• Biochemistry and immunoelectrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid: normal.
Cerebrospinal fluid serology was negative.
• Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm with no changes in repolarization.
• Cranial computed tomography: a cortical hypodense lesion that can be assessed in a single cut in the right temporoparietal region without significant mass effect and with a slight enlargement of a near sulcus.
In the left cerebellar hemisphere, a deep hypodense lacunar lesion was also identified.
Chorea is characterized by a parietal sulcus on the left side with a small area of cortical hypodensity at the depth of the sulcus.
Abstract: left parietal lobe ischemic lesions of old-fashioned appearance, right temporo-occipital region and cerebellar hemisphere of the left side.
These were ischemic events of small vessels and in several territories.
In addition, a diffuse brain retraction greater than expected was identified for the patient's age group.
• Neurosonological study: supraaortic trunk duplex: patent carotid axes,▁intimal thickening in the right common carotid.
No atheroma plaques were observed.
Patent vertebrals with left dominance.
Transcranial duplex: symmetrical and permeable middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery.
Posterior fossa: normal basilar, permeable vertebral, left dominance.
• bubble test: negative at rest and with Valsalva maneuvers.
• Cervical CT angiography and cerebral arterial polygon: no significant carotid or vertebral atherosclerotic lesions were identified.
In the anterior circulation, no alterations of the anterior cerebral arteries were identified, dominance of the left side as anatomical variant of normality and without alterations of the middle cerebral arteries in the segments M1-M2.
No alterations were observed in the circulation of both IAP, AICA, superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries, with apparent millimetric permeability of the posterior communicating arteries.
• Cranial magnetic resonance imaging: in the supratentorial compartment there was a zone of hyperintensity in sequences T2 and FLAIR, which immediately affected the caudal cerebral cortex of the left hand sulcus according to the caudal area.
This zone showed a marked hyperintensity in the diffusion image with decrease of apparent diffusion coefficients.
There were other areas of peripheral hyperintensity in FLAIR sequences, none of which showed a restriction of diffusion, one of them is located in the depth of the left circumflex, indicating the expansion of the left side.
There was also a hyperintensity in one of its temporary circumcisions, but without associated volume loss and extension of the alterations to the adjacent white matter.
In addition, in the posterior fossa, a focus of millimetric hyperintensity located in the cerebellar hemisphere of the left side was visualized, also without apparent decrease in diffusion coefficients.
Conclusion: acute ischemic injury affecting part of the primary motor area of the left side.
Other lesions were identified, one of them of chronic aspect and another evolved located in the cerebral cortex of the left parietal and right temporal lobes, respectively.
Old lacunar infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
• Magnetic resonance angiography of the▁polyposis: no alterations of special pathological significance were observed in the▁polypoid features.
The cervical study did not identify mural hematomas in the cervical segments of both vertebral arteries.
• Arteriography of the supraaortic trunks and CI: alteration of the distal branches of the cerebral arteries suggestive of vasculitis of the medium/small caliber arteries.
• Echocardiogram (ECG): unchanged.
• Holter ECG: no cardiac rhythm abnormalities were identified.
• A skin biopsy was performed from the right knee: a perivascular inflammatory process of mild dermal superficial intensity, histologically nonspecific.
No vasculitis or vascular occlusion images were found.
Ev.▁~~~ No.▁~~~ No.▁~~~ No.
Diagnosis • Ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery of infrequent cause.
• Clinically silent, evolving territorial infarctions (left parietal and right temporal).
• Cerebral vasculitis with small and medium size involvement.
• Livedo reticularis.
Located as Sneddon syndrome
