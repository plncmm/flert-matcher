Anamnesis A 63-year-old male with a previous diagnosis of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy, emergency room as code stroke.
At 5:30 a.m. in the middle of the night, it is found on the ground with difficulties to mobilize and with language and inconsistent.
The last time he was asymptomatic he was at 00:00 h. The patient is dysphasic, confused and disoriented, so it is not possible to anamnesis.
The family does not provide any more data of interest, denying symptoms the previous days.
Physical examination revealed arterial hypertension 141/81 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm, oxygen saturation 99% (FiO2 21%), temperature 35.8 oC.
DTX: 100.
Aware, disoriented, confused.
Fluctuating language alteration with mixed dysphasic features.
No campimetry, cranial nerves or motor abnormalities or malformations.
Additional tests • Blood tests, chest X-ray and ECG are normal.
The clinical suspicion of stroke in the territory of the left MCA of undetermined evolution time is made a basal and multimodal cranial CT with perfusion and CT angiography where no alterations are evident.
▁Complementary diagnosis was made when the tests ruled out fibrinolytic treatment and the patient was admitted to the Stroke Unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke of the left MCA.
Upon admission to the Stroke Unit, a partial-onset generalized seizure was observed, which jugularised with diazepam.
The possibility is raised that the initial situation of the patient corresponds to a post-critical period, even the initial cause of the unexplained crisis, without ruling out the vascular cause.
An urgent electroencephalogram is requested, where a pattern of periodic lateralized▁epileptiform discharges (PLED) is identified. Hemodynamically, the patient presents with a low-grade fever, and from the neurological point of view, he continues to present neurological disorder.
Six hours after admission, a lumbar puncture was performed for CSF analysis, requesting HSV PCR upon clinical suspicion and supported by EEG of herpetic encephalitis.
Treatment After lumbar puncture, whose emergency biochemistry is normal, empirical treatment is started with a beta-blocker 750 mg/8h. EHS recovers the patient's favorable evolution over the days of admission, waiting for a normal MRI.
The patient complained of difficulty in recalling memories and complained that occasionally he noticed strange smells, the examination being normal at all times.
The negative result of PCR analysis HSV was obtained a day later, and MRI showed findings consistent with left limbic encephalopathy.
Treatment was completed with topical▁steroids (10 doses), and aetiological diagnosis of encephalitis was initiated. A differential diagnosis was made with autoimmune, inflammatory and paraneoplastic pathologies.
The tumor extension study was performed, which was negative, blood serology and negative markers of autoimmunity in blood and a CSF study of onconeuronal antibodies was performed, which were equally negative.
A new control MRI is requested, which is performed 5 days after the first, observing a pseudonodular image in the left temporal region that presents diffusion restriction, without contrast being objectified pathological enhancements after surgery.
The possibility of a low grade malignant process is proposed.
a. glioma suggestive of stability, the patient is discharged home with outpatient follow-up in the Neurology and Neurosurgery Department, receiving treatment with levetirazetam 1000 mg/12 h, with the diagnosis of symptomatic temporal-grade epilepsy
One month after discharge, the patient was admitted again due to complex partial status requiring increased dose of levetirazetam at 1,500 mg/12 h and adding lacosamide 200 mg/12 h. A relative MRI was performed prior to admission.
From the neurological point of view, the patient progresses to his previous situation.
The patient was discharged and referred for a new control MRI within 2 months.
In the new control MRI, a previous lesion with areas of uptake within the lesion accompanied by increased perfusion was observed, all of which was compatible with tumor progression.
The patient is evaluated by Neurosurgery and a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion is performed.
The pathological study resulted in the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma grade III.
After the patient complaining of memory and emotional complaints, with occasional complaints of nomination to the examination, the importance of continued treatment with radiation therapy and on medical failure is stressed.
