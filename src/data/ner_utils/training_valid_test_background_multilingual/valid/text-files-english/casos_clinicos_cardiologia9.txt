Inheritance and vasopressors in the ICU 09/18/2012 with the diagnosis of septic shock of unknown etiology, with the urinary focus as the most probable, requiring low doses of inotropic drugs.
Five hours later, the patient remained stable, being able to withdraw inotropic and vasopressive drugs.
However, disorientation and sleepiness persist, with aphasia and right hemiplegia of new onset.
Urgent skull CT scan was performed and evaluated by Neurology, without intravascular invasive procedure due to a history of lumbar puncture in the previous 24 hours, and antiplatelet therapy with ASA was administered.
Emergency TTE was performed, which showed LV not dilated with severe MR.
On 09/19/2012, in the morning, there was a deterioration in the level of consciousness, with pupillary clear and decortication posture.
OTI and connection to mechanical ventilation and a new head CT are required.
Despite treatment, neurological deterioration progresses, persisting intubated and with only some trunk reflexes.
No feverish peak at any time.
In the anamnesis directed to the relatives, no possible focus of endocarditis was observed.
TEE 09/19/2012 Little mobile vegetation and homogeneous density of 15x14 mm, with perforated aneurysm associated with anterior mitral valve.
Severe mitral insufficiency with 2 jets, one that originates through the perforation of the aneurysm and is directed to the posterior wall of the left atrium with a coanda effect, with another of smaller magnitude at the central level.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation due to stenosis
Mild degenerative aortic insufficiency.
Cultivational Cultivations Pathed upon admission.
Positive for Streptococcus mitis sensitive to Penicillin,▁Cyclin, Ceftriaxone, Cotrimoxazole resistant to Clindamycin and Erronetin.
The clinical course progressed to brain death on 09/21/2012, 96 hours after admission to the ICU.
Cervico-thoraco-bladder catheterization is requested because it can be considered a donor.
TAC body: Less than pin bone and right kidney compatible with small embolic infarctions.
