An 8-year-old male, with no relevant clinical history, presented to the emergency department with fever up to 39.5 or 14 days of evolution, chills, bilateral emergency cervical lymphadenopathy, and skin discomfort.
She had been treated with 500 mg of methotrexate per day for five days.
Physical examination revealed a grade II/III systolic murmur at the auscultatory focus corresponding to the left ventricle.
The electroencephalogram and chest X-ray did not show any pathological findings.
Laboratory tests showed the presence of inflammatory markers: leukocytes of 10,500 cells/ml, neutrophilia of 70%, and elevated CRP (119 mg/L).
Cefuroxime IV was started.
200 mg/kg/day prior serial blood cultures were taken on two consecutive days.
At 24 hours of non-compliance, both hemocultives were positive.
Gram stain revealed Gram-positive bacilli pleomorphic in the form of "V".
The direct identification of the microorganism from positive blood cultures by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF was C. pseudodiphtheriticum.
In this context, an echocardiography was performed, which showed the existence of a vegetative formation of 10 mm (FE) on the left ventricular side, causing moderate regurgitation, with no impact on hemodynamics and cardiac function.
The presence of bicuspid aortic valve disease was also confirmed.
With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, gentamicin (6 mg/kg/day) was added to therapy pending the definitive identification of the microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
After 24 h of inoculation in solid culture media, growth of▁grey colonies in positive blood agar plates catalase was observed.
Identification by 16S RNA gene sequencing confirmed the isolation of Corynebacterium pseudo­diphtheriticum.
Antibiogram with epsilol resistance (E-test) showed a narrow sensitivity index (CIM > 256 μg/ml) and sensitivity (CIM) to amoxicillin/ác.
Treatment with antibiotics was started (16 μg/ml), cefoxime (0.38 μg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.5 μg/ml), linezolid (38 μg/ml), febrile penicillin (0.25 μg/ml).
Due to the good evolution, having negativized the hemocultives and without imaging changes, cardiac surgery was not proposed at that time, unless there was any clinical deterioration.
Sixteen days after admission, the patient again developed fever associated with frontalis, desorienation and poor motor skills, which led to right brachial paresis, right hemi-hospitalization and aphasia.
The clinical picture was interpreted as a septic cerebral embolism.
Linezolid was added to the antimicrobial treatment due to possible overinfection by resistant microorganisms in some other source.
Because of the risk of a new embolism, cardiac surgery was performed on the aortic valve territory (Ros procedure), which was successfully overcome.
On the third postoperative day the patient developed intracranial hypertension.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an ischemic infarction due to occlusion at the origin of the left middle cerebral artery.
Due to its severity, the patient died in the following days.
The final microbiological results confirmed the isolation of C. pseudodiphtheriticum in the blood cultures.
