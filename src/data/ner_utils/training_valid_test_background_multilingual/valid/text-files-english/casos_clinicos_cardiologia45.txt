PRESENT ANESTHETIC ANESTHESIS, PRESENTATION AND EXPLANATORY A 50-year-old male who came to the emergency department for chest pain.
No known allergies.
No toxic habits.
She does not undergo routine treatment.
No CVRF.
Surgery was performed on a patient who underwent open cholecystectomy in childhood and left meniscectomy as the only antecedents.
Assignment from the cardiological point of view, until the early morning of admission (4:00 to.m.).
It begins with prickling pains at the level of the jaw.
Subsequently, they irradiate to the anterior region of the chest, are made of oppressive type, of moderate intensity, without vegetative cutting.
Spontaneously resolved one hour later.
It has several recurrences, of greater intensity, so it comes to the emergency department.
It arrives more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms, with slight residual discomfort.
Improvement after conventional analgesia.
On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable.
TA 119/83 mmHg; HR 68 bpm; SatO2 98 % with room air; Ta 36.1°C.
Glasgow Coma Scale: 15/15.
Consent, oriented in the 3⁄4n.
Eupneic at rest, well hydrated, well nourished and infused.
CA: Rhythmic without murmurs or extracts.
PA: vesicular murmur preserved in both lung fields without overlapping sounds.
Abdomen: hydroaerial noises present, blando, non-painful to deep or superficial fixation.
Renal impairment (-).
Extremities: no edema, no signs of DVT.
Basic neurological condition was normal.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES ECG: sinus rhythm at 68 bpm.
Poor growth of R wave in precordial leads, Q wave isolated in leads III, with no other alterations.
There were no changes in subsequent electrocardiograms.
Portable echocardiography (Emergency Department): LV non-dilated, or hypertrophic, with normal global and segmental systolic function.
Normal aortic root.
Undilated RV.
No significant valvular heart disease.
No pleural effusion.
Blood count: leukocytes 5200/uL; neutrophils 61.3 %; lymphocytes 27.2 %; Hb 15.5 gr/dl; Htc 43.4 %; VCM 87, platelet 180,000/uL.
Hemostasis: APTT 29.3 sec; INR 1.
glucose 112 mg/dl, creatinine 1.07 mg/dl, sodium 141 mmol/l, potassium 4 mg/l, total protein 6.3 g/dl, phosphorus total acid 3.496 mmol/dl, bilirubin 163 mg/dl, alkaline cholesterol 114 mg
Enzymatic serology: 1a: CK 766 U/l, troponin I 25.89 ng/ml (normal < 0.06 ).
2a: CK 727 U/I troponin I 36.13 ng/ml.
3a: CK 696 U/I, troponin I 27.52 ng/ml.
Chest X-ray showed no evidence of CHF or parenchymal infiltrates.
Serology: IgM HAV: negative; IgG anti HBc: negative; Anti HCV: negative; IgM anti CMV: negative; IgM against ACV: negative; Anti HIV: negative; IgG toxoplasmosis IgM: negative.
MRSA culture: negative.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Imagn 2): VI with preserved systolic function.
Late gadolinium enhancement in basal and middle segments, anterior, lateral and inferior left ventricle respecting only the septum and apex.
The enhancement showed subepicardial distribution without transmural involvement, being compatible with myosinitis.
Coronary angiography: TCI, DA and CD within normal limits.
Mild CX: 20-30 %.
Preserved LVEF on ventriculography.
No images suggesting coronary anomalies, dissection or thrombosis.
Clinical manifestations of chest pain and elevated enzyme levels establish the initial diagnosis of NSTEACS.
She was admitted to the ICU and started on dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, statins and beta-blockers.
It remains hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic, with no cardiac rhythm abnormalities or CHF data.
Serial markers of myocardial damage show a clear increase, in addition to continuing with mild chest pain.
Coronary angiography was performed, which did not reveal any coronary disease to justify the clinical picture.
Laboratory tests revealed increased transaminase and bilirubin without clinical abnormalities at the digestive level, so a viral serology study was requested.
a Febrile response to coronary angiography was re-questioned to the patient, who reported that in the last 2 months he had presented with catarrhal symptoms and pharyngitis with symptoms the week prior to admission of general▁malaise, myalgia
The presence of coronary arteries without significant lesions, pain after respiratory infection and elevated markers of myocardial damage establishes the diagnostic suspicion of myocarditis.
Treatment of NSTEACS is discontinued.
On the ward, the patient remains stable, with no recurrence of chest pain, no symptoms of heart failure, or arrhythmias.
An echocardiographic study prior to discharge showed preserved LVEF without alterations in global or segmental▁contractility.
There were no ECG changes during admission.
Clinical manifestations were favorable, with treatment with ACE inhibitors.
MRI was requested 48 hours later, which confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis.
Acute▁bronchiolitis of probable viral etiology.
Conserved LVEF.
