A 61-year-old woman with morbid obesity, intrinsic asthma, idiopathic right ventricular paresis and hypoventilation-obesity syndrome, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, hypertensive heart disease and latent tuberculosis infection, among others.
She had had a two-year progressive deterioration of her functional capacity due to arterial embolism in the right lower limb, with syndrome associated with the embolectomy, which left femoral mononeuritis with difficulty.
She came to the emergency department of our center due to dyspnea, fever 38.2oC and acute dry cough in the last 24 hours.
On physical examination, wheezing and lengthening of the time due to infection were auscultated; bronchodilators, corticotherapy and levofloxacin were initiated when asthma exacerbation was suspected.
A few days later, he was scaled to meropenem, aztreonam and vancomycin when multi-resistant Pseudomonas was isolated and MRSA in sputum, and a chest CT was performed without relevant changes.
As the treatment did not improve, the corticosteroid dose increased, nebulized colistin was eliminated, and antibiotics were rotated to cotrimoxazole and zolid, although a previous regimen exceeded the previous one, resulting in a worsening of oral aphta.
A new chest CT scan showed the de novo appearance of multiple bilateral nodular lesions.
CMV PCR for oral ulcers was positive.
Due to the suspicion of a significant immunosuppression situation, a gammaglobulin study was also requested, in which there was a deficiency of IgG and IgM and a mannequin that was positive for very high titers.
Treatment was initiated with ganciclovir, voriconazole and anidulamycin, but the patient had an unfavorable evolution to death a few days later.
Clinical autopsy revealed that the cause of death was invasive aspergillosis.
