An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 160 l.p.m.
e biventricular hypertrophy.
The last echocardiogram performed 2 weeks before admission showed left ventricular dilation with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 39mm Z+7.3 FE30% and global longitudinal deformation −10%.
Leukocytes count was 21,400/mm3 with 12,890/mm3 neutrophils and C-reactive protein 36mg/L.
Treatment was initiated with fluid restriction and conventional therapy (1-2 PML).

Blood tests did not show▁lymphocites (2540/μL), C-reactive protein was 244mg/L, and D-dipsia was 973ng/mL.
Blood cultures were negative.
