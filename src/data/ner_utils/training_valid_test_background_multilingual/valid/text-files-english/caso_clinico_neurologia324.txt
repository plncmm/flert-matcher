Anamnesis A 35-year-old Asian woman, who comes to the emergency department for an episode of loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic movements of onset during sleep, associated post-tranquillization headache 20 minutes or prolonged tongue debut, associated with a morcitic frontalis
Among the personal history there were no cerebrovascular risk factors, but an episode similar to the current self-limiting episode in China 15 years ago, not studied, without medication, has been asymptomatic since then.
Represented in Spain for 3 months.
He worked in a shoe and waiter factory.
There was no neurological family history of interest.
He did not report toxic, drug or▁herb intake.
Physical training Conscious and oriented in three.
Well hydrated and nourished.
Temperature 36.6 oC, blood pressure 136/90 mmHg, heart rate 77 bpm.
Good distal perfusion.
Eupneic.
Absence of mucosal-cutaneous lesions.
Isochoric and normoreactive hairs to light, no signs of meningism.
Eye fundus was unchanged.
The cranial nerves were unaltered.
Force and sensitivity in all its modalities preserved symmetrically in the four limbs.
Mild, symmetrical, normosmia, cutaneous plantar flexor reflex.
Coordination, posture and gait were within normal limits.
▁Complementary tests • General biochemistry, blood count, coagulation, urine sediment, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were performed, without alterations.
• Normal electroencephalogram.
• Lumbar puncture: opening pressure 10 cm H2O.
Crystalline fluid, without blockages
▁Cytobiochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid showed no alterations.
• Microbiology: syphilis serology, HIV, hepatitis C and B virus (Ac.
Hbs, AcHbc, AcHbe positive).
Giardia cysts positive in▁faeces.
Coprocultive negative.
Serologies: hydatidosis, cysticercosis, toxoplasmosis, stercolaris, negative.
Mantoux 15 mm.
Sputum smear negative.
• Cranial computed tomography (CT) (without contrast): a hyperdense image (16 x 11 mm) is observed in the left parieto-occipital cortex, with calcium-point images of higher density suggestive of
There are three other hyperdense punctiform images of the white matter located in the left semioval center, another in the right cerebellar hemisphere and the last in the cortex of the right occipital lobe.
• Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (without contrast): a heterogeneous lesion (25 x 15 mm) is identified in the left parietal region.
In T2 sequences, it characteristically presents a hyperintense center and a very hypointense peripheral ring.
In echo-gradient sequences shows significant magnetic susceptibility.
Around the lesion, there is a slight hypointensity that translates hemosiderin deposit due to previous bleeding.
A minor venous angioma is observed.
In addition, there are other smaller lesions in the left periventricular region, right parasagittal occipital region, the upper margin of the right cerebellar hemisphere, the left middle vermisular retroinsular peduncle,
Diagnosis • Symptomatic epilepsy in relation to multiple cavernomatosis.
• Other diagnoses: asymptomatic intestinal giardiasis.
Treatment and evolution Treatment was initiated with paracetamol and levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours, with good tolerance and response, remaining asymptomatic without recurrence of new seizures.
She was treated with metronidazole to treat asymptomatic intestinal giardiasis coinfection.
It was proposed to carry out a genetic study, as well as follow-up of their descendants, pending their evaluation in consultations after hospital discharge.
