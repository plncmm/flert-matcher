A 35-year-old male, born in Mali and residing in Spain for 8 years, agricultural worker.
There are no known drug allergies or personal history, except migraine-type headache.
He came to the emergency room for pain in hypochondrium and left renal fossa of 4 days of evolution, along with occasional nausea and fever, without voiding syndrome or hematuria, for which he had been treated medically.
On examination, the patient is in good general condition, with good hydration of the skin and mucous membranes, aphthousand hemodynamically stable, with blood pressure of 123/83 mmHg, heart rate of 64 beats 97% without oxygen supply and sealant.
The abdomen is painful to palpation in the left flank, with a palpable mass in the left hypochondrium and a positive left renal percussion.
Laboratory tests showed microcytic anemia (biochemical hemoglobin a normal creatinine / dL), normal leukocytes (4400/ mm3) with neutrophilia of 81.1%, C-reactive protein of 31.8 mg / L and a slight increase in urea dL.
The urine test showed proteinuria of 300 mg/dl with negative leukocytes, nitrites and blood.
Due to the persistence of pain, an abdominal ultrasound is initially performed, which describes a chronic dilation of the left excretory system with echogenic content inside.
With these findings, it is extended to the performance of an abdominal CT, which shows a markedly enlarged left kidney (20.4 x 15 x 12 cm of maximum cranial-causal axis x anterior-posterior paroxysmal expansion x transverse maximum
In addition, calcification of the distal third of both ureters and bladder walls is observed.
Differential diagnosis Given the findings on abdominal CT, we must make a differential diagnosis that includes the most common causes that give rise to calcification of the bladder walls and ureters, together with genitocamurinary tuberculosis, which is the most common.
Urinary tuberculosis is the third leading cause of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and occurs in 2-20% of people with pulmonary tuberculosis, being more common in men and with a mean age at diagnosis of 40 years.
In the context of the dissemination of bacilli from a pulmonary focus, these reach the interstice and renal▁cavernous sinus, which, over many years, can manifest stenosis with the excretion of bacilli to the urinary tract hydrothermal,
Papillary destruction can lead to abscess formation.
Typical clinical manifestations consist in the insidious appearance of a voiding syndrome, together with hematuria (micro or macroscopic), systemic symptoms being rare (fever, weight loss).
Pyuria with negative urine culture is typical.
The age of our patient, the country of origin and the presence of ureteral and bladder stones with hydronephrosis favor the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
However, the lack of previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis, the lack of voiding syndrome, and the absence of pyuria and hematuria go against this diagnosis.
Malignant tumors of the bladder and upper urinary tract occur at a mean age of 70 years.
Urothelial (or transitional cell) cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the bladder and upper urinary tract. It can be multifocal, due to the exposure of the urothelium to potential▁carcinogens excreted in urine.
2 Other types of tumors are rarer, epithelial cell cancer being the second most common variety affecting the upper urinary tract (8% in developed countries but with a much higher frequency in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic).
In addition to S. haematobium infection, its occurrence has been associated with other types of urinary or recurrent infections, lithiasis, radiotherapy and tobacco consumption.2.3 Malignant tumors present with constitutional hydrophrosis or lumbar pain.
Calcifications of the urinary tract appear if the tumor is associated with schistosomiasis.
Although the patient was diagnosed with hydronephrosis in an endemic area for S. haematobium and presented with pain due to hydronephrosis without voiding or constitutional syndrome, he did not present macro- or microscopic hematuria, which is a urinary cancer.
Of the five Schistosoma species that cause infections in humans, S haematobium (endemic in Africa and the Middle East) is the one that causes genitourinary disease.
In chronic infections of long duration (inactive phase of the disease), proteinuria appears via the development and stenosis to different levels of the urinary tract, with a urinary sediment where there is usually no hematuria and mild epithelial cell cancer.6,7 Hydrops can already be
Bacterial superinfection with the development of pyelonephritis is common.
5 The country of origin of our patient, the presence of urinary tract calcifications without hematuria, and the development of hydronephrosis make schistosomiasis the most probable cause of the patient's clinical picture.
Abdominal CT findings were recorded upon admission for study.
It is initially managed with analgesia, bladder catheterization and third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone).
Chest X-ray, sputum smear microscopy and Lowenstein-Jensen culture of sputum and urine, and infectious serology for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C virus, which are negative, are requested.
Urocultive examination, urine tests for cystosoma and serology were also requested, which were also negative.
The patient remains hospitalized due to persistent pain, requiring continuous infusion analgesia for pain control.
Given the suspicion of pionephrosis, a percutaneous left nephrostomy was performed, with a flow rate of approximately 700 cc of purulent fluid, sending samples for microbiological study that were negative.
After the intervention, the patient showed significant clinical improvement, leaving the catheter connected to the bag.
A new consultation to Urology is performed in order to programme nephrectomy and cystoscopy to obtain a biopsy to confirm the pathology.
Urethrocystoscopy showed a bladder with granular mucosa on its entire surface, and a biopsy was performed.
It is reported the presence of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with abundant▁eosinophils and rounded structures at the lamina propria level compatible with schistosomes.
The patient evolved favorably, with good control of pain and maintaining the affliction, so it was decided to discharge with follow-up in Infectious Diseases and Urology consultations.
Upon review in the Infectious Diseases Clinic, treatment with praziquantel 1400 mg every 8 hours for 1 day was initiated.
Finally, the patient underwent nephrectomy.
Final diagnosis: Chronic schistosomiasis of the urinary tract with severe secondary left hydronephrosis.
