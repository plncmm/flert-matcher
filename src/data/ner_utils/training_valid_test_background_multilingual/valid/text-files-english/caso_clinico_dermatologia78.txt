This is a 70-year-old man, born in northern Santander and from Bogotá, with a history of chronic▁lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed 5 years before and chronic infection by hepatitis B virus in the erratic phase, who consulted a general emergency department.
As antecedents, in addition to the above, he had been corrected with clamp (clipping) a cerebral aneurysm, he had undergone an arachnoidectomy and esophageal varices ligation.
During hospitalization, lesions were observed in the lower limbs, which were asymptomatic and of progressive extension.
Consultation was requested with the Emergency Medical Service (ED) for malignant transformation of the▁papules and erythematous-violaceous plaques on the inner side of the thighs.
On the left anterior side of the cleft palate, there was a rare malformation with a narrow band, and a biopsy was taken.
The diagnostic impression was that of a vasculitic process.
Biopsy reported skin with epidermis of usual appearance.
In the dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue stromal cells with prominent irregular nucleus and acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate with leukocytoclastic phenomenon and red blood cell extravasation were found.
In addition, dilated dermal vessels were found, with irregular and endothelial cells, some of them with prominent hyperchromia nucleus.
The PAS staining (Periodicosis-Schiff) was negative for dementia.
Immunohistochemical study for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed, which strongly stressed the endothelial and large stromal cells previously described.
With these findings a diagnosis of a cutaneous viral infectious process by cytomegalovirus was made.
During hospitalization, the patient presented with a clinical picture of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, associated with encephalopathy of hepatic origin and prerenal hyper- azoemia due to the disorientation and severe anemia.
The patient was managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and support, but had a torpid course and died two days later, without starting antiviral treatment.
