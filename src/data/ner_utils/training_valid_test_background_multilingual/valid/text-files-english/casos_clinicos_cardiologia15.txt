A 55-year-old male with biological valve prostheses (Bioimplant) mitral and aortic since 1989.
He was admitted in May 1996 due to low back pain, fever and general shortening of 4 weeks of evolution, with clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis.
The physical examination of the patient revealed fever of 38 °C, apical impulse displaced laterally and inferiorly to the anterior axillary line, rhythmic heart sounds of normal intensity with mild systolic/aortic ejection murmur II.
On admission laboratory tests a leukocyte count of 11,300/μl (91%) was observed, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (GSR) was 12 mm at the first hour.
The rest of the analytical parameters were within normal limits.
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 70 beats/min, PR space 0.16.
QRS axis at + 60° and nonspecific ventricular repolarization disorder from V4 to V6.
Chest X-ray showed grade I radiological cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic index of 0.55.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral prosthetic valve dysfunction with one of its leaflets and mild insufficiency due to endo prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction, with mild vegetative insufficiency; non-definite vegetation;
Six serial hemocultives were performed, and Staphylococcus capitis growth was detected in all of them.
Specific antibiotic therapy was established according to the antibiogram and according to the therapeutic regimen recommended in the literature with vancomycin (30 mg/kg iv.
every 24 h in four daily doses), rifampicin (300 mg. v. o.
every 8 h) both for six weeks and gentamicin (1 mg/kg bw).
every 8 hours) for two weeks 7, remitting the fever on the third day of treatment.
Six days after admission, the patient suffered a fleeting episode of dizziness, dysarthria, paresthesia in the left hand, headache and generalized tremor.
The cranial CT scan showed a brain infarction image of right temporoparietal location.
Transesophageal echocardiography detected valve vegetations of aortic and mitral location, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation.
Fifteen days after admission, the patient developed pain in the left hypochondrium and increased sacral slope.
An abdominal ultrasound and a gallium-67 scintigraphy showed the existence of a splenic infarction.
Fever recurred 21 days after admission, and a new laboratory test showed increased ESR up to 84 mm in the first hour and anemia not present at admission with a hematocrit of 9.8 mg/dl.
Given the clinical evolution of the patient, it was decided to perform a surgical intervention, with double replacement of biological valve prostheses by new mechanical valve prostheses on day 30 of admission.
The same antibiotic therapy regimen was continued for another two weeks.
Microorganism growth was not detected in the hemocultives performed later.
The clinical evolution of the patient was favorable and he was discharged 57 days after admission.
The germ entrance door could not be identified.
