She had previously consulted for the reason described above, and so far she was treated with topical nitroglycerin, topical mupirocin and topical corticosteroids after being initially oriented as a perianal fistula.

Given the diagnostic orientation of sexually transmitted infection, a diagnostic study was requested with blood serology (syphilis, HIV and hepatotropic virus) and PCRs for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma Genitalium and Gonoco in the pharynx.
Finally, a sample of the perianal ulcer was taken to expand a PCR (C.L.‚ñÅlymphogranuloma - L1, L2 and L3) and Herpes venanal Virus (C.L.)
