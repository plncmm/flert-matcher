A 40-year-old man, a chronicler, hypertensive with associated hypercalciuria, obese (BMI 30Kg/m2), with no toxic habits, with family history of maternal tuberculosis in children.
The patient consulted for an inflammatory mass in the right costal pair, without pain, cough, fever or constitutional syndrome.
After two weeks without improvement, puncture and drainage were performed, with negative sputum smear but positive culture for multisensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Subsequently, a CAT scan revealed a subpleural nodule of 2 mm in the right upper lobe, thickening and ipsilateral pleural calcifications, an air cavity secondary to drainage in the lateral wall and small adenopathy.
After having the culture postponed one month later, treatment with Rifater was started. Two months later Rifaldin replaced it. Four months later, the rib access had a complete closure and a rib cage showed a compatible irregularity.
In successive reviews, uric acid (8mg/dl) and triglycerides (191mg/dl) increased compatible with good treatment adherence, with normalization after completion.
