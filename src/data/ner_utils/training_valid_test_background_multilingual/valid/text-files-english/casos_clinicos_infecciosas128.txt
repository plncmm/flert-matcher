We report the case of a 73-year-old male, without known drug allergies, ex-smoker with a accumulated tobacco consumption of 106 packs/year and drinker of about 10 grams of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, with uncontrolled hypertension.
In addition, the patient had a symptomatic chronic obliterative of the lower limbs (LLLL), so he underwent surgery in 2006 performing an arteriobifemoral bypass with a Dacron graft.
Since then, she was under regular follow-up by vascular surgery.
In 2014, the patient was evaluated in gastroenterology clinics for abdominal pain.
The finding of a blinded plastron on CT requested during the study, and with the suspicion of colorectal neoplasia, was programmed and a right hemicolectomy was performed.
In the surgical specimen, a blinded ulcer was observed and the tumor origin of the lesion was ruled out, and the etiology of the perforation was not completely established.
The episode was resolved after surgery and the postoperative course was uneventful.
In May 2017, in a routine Doppler ultrasound in vascular consultations, the patient was asymptomatic, dilation of both distal anastomoses not previously present was observed, so a CT was requested to exclude stenosis of the distal anastomosis bypass.
In this context, and not yet having performed the requested CT, the patient comes to the emergency department in July 2017 for asthenia and progressive dyspnea to moderate respiratory failure of 24-36 hours of evolution, cardiac infection or semiology.
The patient reported a 4-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, colic rhythm unrelated to food, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea without pathological, diurnal and nocturnal products.
Afebrile at all times.
She also reported a 4-5 kg involuntary loss of consciousness in the last weeks.
On physical examination, the patient was afflicted with hemodynamically stable condition.
Mild cutaneous-mucosal discomfort was highlighted.
Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic murmur II/VI in non-irradiated apex, with no signs of cardiac failure.
The abdomen was palpable mass, tenderness, no enlargement or signs of peritonitis.
Peripheral lymphadenopathy was not observed and femoral and pedal pulses were preserved, symmetrical.
The emergency laboratory tests showed mild hyponatremia, anemia of 9.3 gr/dL similar to baseline and elevated acute phase reactants, with a C-reactive protein of 105 mg/L.
No studies were performed in emergency departments.
The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine for the study of the constitutional syndrome, requesting the study of anemias and an abdominal CT with contrast.
An increase in acute phase reactants and iron-deficiency anemia persisted analytically, with Hb levels similar to those usually presented by the patient, with the rest of the analytical anodyne.
On CT scan, a slight dilation of common femoral arteries was observed at the level of the anastomosis with the periprocedural halo and small fluid collection adjacent to the left common femoral artery of about 2 cm in diameter.
There was no contrast leak or other abdominal findings.
After performing the CT, the patient was assessed by a physician of Infectious Diseases who established a probable infectious complication of the femoral bypass.
Differential diagnosis We present a patient with radiological image compatible with a periprosthetic collection.
The main options to assess would be, on the one hand, bypass infection; on the other hand, after the onset of another anastomosis; less plausible that there was no contrast leak and considering that this first complication is more common adjacent organs,
Therefore, as a first option, we would like to evaluate the infection of the vascular prosthesis.
With this suspicion, endocarditis should be considered as a potential complication of this type of infection.
In addition, the gastrointestinal clinic should alert us to a possible fistula of periaortic lesion.
As discussed above, the possibility of vascular prosthesis infection was stressed.
On examination, the left inguinal region showed no changes in color or other data suggestive of local inflammation.
The case was commented on with Vascular Surgery and given that on CT the collection seemed accessible, it was decided to perform an echodoppler in which the lesion could be seen, so a puncture-aspiration technique was made with a macroscopically guided foot, with purulent material.
A sample was sent for culture and, as there were no data on hemodynamic instability/sepsis, it was decided to keep without antibiotic therapy pending the results of urgent Gram stain and culture.
Blood cultures (BC) were performed without fever.
Gram stain showed no bacteria and the culture of the material obtained by puncture was negative.
However, in HC without fever, Enterococcus faecalis with basal phenotype grew in all HCs (4/4).
Following these results, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was requested to rule out the presence of infective endocarditis (IE) and it was decided to start antibiotic treatment with intravenous ampicillin, 2 grams every 4 hours.
TTE described moderate mitral insufficiency not previously known (although there were no previous studies or studies), with preserved LVEF and no signs of dementia.
However, in the presence of E. faecalis bacteraemia and valvulopathy, it was decided to perform a transesophageal echocardiography, which was negative for endocarditis.
The patient remained afflicted at all times.
Therefore, our suspicion was that of an infection of the femoral bypass with secondary bacteremia due to E. faecalis without associated data for the moment.
On the one hand, we have raised the best strategy for antibiotic treatment and, on the other hand, what attitude to take regarding bypass.
As for antibiotic treatment, we added a scheme similar to that of a enterocolitis, adding ceftriaxone IV, 2 grams every 12 hours.
In the face of the prosthesis, assuming it as the primary focus of infection, the need to intervene to the patient was initially raised to explant the prosthesis and to place an axillobifemoral bypass.
At first, the patient refused the surgery due to the risks of the technique, and then it was decided to perform a diagnostic-therapeutic arteriography of the lower limbs (left endomyelography route) with the intention of angioplasty sector revascularization.
Arteriography showed a patent biliary bypass.
However, after catheterization of the native iliac artery, a critical injury of the external iliac artery was observed, so it was not possible to access it endovascularly until the bypass level.
At this point, the patient finally accepted the surgery initially proposed.
Thus, it was decided to schedule it after 1 week of intravenous antibiotic therapy and after extracting control HC.
In the operating room a fistula was evidenced (from the 4th duodenal bypass), appearing to the explant of the femoral bypass 8 mm, suture and implant of double axillary bypass grafting ring.
Samples were sent to Microbiology for culture of fluid from the periprosthetic collection and also kept to cultivate the protuberant material explanted.
Both preoperative control CH and cultures of intraoperative samples were negative.
The postoperative period was favorable, with no fever and good peripheral revascularization.
The surgical wounds did not present complications.
Thus, after 17 days of treatment with ampicillin IV and 10 days of treatment with ceftriaxone, it was decided to be discharged home to continue with amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours orally until completing 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy.
The patient has followed periodic reviews by vascular surgery.
One year after surgery, the patient has had a very favorable evolution, remaining asymptomatic, with no clinical intermittent claudication and no data on complications of the new bypass.
He is currently being followed up for vascular surgery.
Final diagnosis: Vascular prosthesis infection with secondary bacteremia caused by Enterococcus faecalis.
