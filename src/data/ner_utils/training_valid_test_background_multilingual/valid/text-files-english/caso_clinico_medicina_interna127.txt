A 64-year-old female patient, with no history, was hospitalized due to a fever of recent onset, intense asthenia, myalgia and polyarthritis.
During hospitalization, she developed left ear chondroitis and inflammatory skin plaques affecting the limbs, evoking Sweet's syndrome and vascular purpura.
The laboratory analysis showed an abrupt increase in CRP, transaminase and neutrophilia.
The infectious study showed a positive IgM serology for HEV.
Acute HEV infection was confirmed by PCR in▁faeces.
Immunological tests, including ANCA and▁cryoglobulinemia did not find specific abnormalities.
Skin biopsies showed neutrophilic dermatosis and vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.
A bone marrow biopsy did not provide arguments for a bone marrow disease.
The clinical picture led us to consider the diagnosis of polychondritis with necrotizing vasculitis.
Despite a bolus of methylprednisolone and prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day, new skin lesions appeared.
▁Cyclophosphamide (0.7 g/m2) was initiated, insufficient to control the disease with the appearance of new necrotic lesions in the toes and persistence of inflammation and leukocytosis.
The disease was closed after a second bolus eight days later.
The patient was then treated with a conventional scheme of necrotizing vasculitis.
Liver function returned to normal rapidly and definitively.
She was treated with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, metorexate.
Currently, after 3 years of evolution and low 5 mg/day of prednisone, the disease behaves mainly as a digital destructive inflammatory arthropathy.
A very limited vasculitis sprout was observed.
Hepatitis has not been reactivated.
We report a case of syndromic association of aggressive necrotizing vasculitis, Sweet's syndrome and chondroitis, contemporary to a HEV infection.
In our case, the infection could be the trigger of the inflammatory disease, which is self-limiting.
HEV can cause chronic infection and cirrhosis in patients or with long-term HIV.
Prognosis seems to be good in patients with low inflammatory rheumatism.
