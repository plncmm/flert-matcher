Coagulation: Prothrombin index 72%, INR 1.15, activated partial thromboplastin time 38 sec.
Angio-CT of the pulmonary arteries: there are no repletion defects in the pulmonary arteries and their ramifications suggest.
The caliber and normal morphology along its thoracic path.
Extensive infiltrates of alveolar characteristics in the right upper lobe and middle lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusion was present in the right hemithorax.
Signs of right heart failure with reflux of contrast to the inferior vena cava and suprahepatic, and rectification of the septum.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV non-dilated or hypertrophic, with hypokinesia of the medial segment of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) face and good global and segmental systolic function.
The aortic valve was trivalvular, with normal functioning.
Prolapse of the posterior mitral valve due to rupture of the chordae tendinous, which conditions a massive mitral valve flail directed to the interauricular septum.
Left atrial fibrillation.
Non-dilated RV with moderate dysfunction.
No pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography: the common trunk shows mild atheromatosis.
The anterior descending artery shows diffuse irregularities with a moderate lesion in the middle segment that affects the origin of the first diagonal, with moderate stenosis.
The circumflex artery is of medium development, destined to two marginal obtuse branches with mild atheromatosis, without significant lesions.
The right coronary artery is the dominant vessel of great development.
In the middle segment, a highly atrophic lesion with severe stenosis was observed.
Good distal bed.
EVOLUTION We evaluated the patient in the emergency room, aiming at a situation of acute pulmonary edema with hemodynamic stability initially.
The echocardioscopy performed in the Emergency Department showed severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior mitral stenosis and a possible rupture of chord tendinous chord. As a result of this procedure, the patient was contacted at the coronary care unit for urgent cardiac surgery.
Upon arrival at the Coronary Care Unit, the emergency room received 100% oxygen reservoir, intravenous diuretics and low-dose ACEIs, although the respiratory form continues to worsen as well as hemodynamically.
Under cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary catheter tip was performed with a medium right saphenous vein, with good quality of vessel.
Subsequently, a biological prosthesis was placed in the left atrium, observing a rupture of a tendinous chord at the level of the head of the belly papillary muscle, and a mitral valve replacement was decided moderately destructured 27.
The patient is transferred back to the Coronary Unit.
In the postoperative evolution, the patient developed severe pump failure in the first hours, requiring inotropic support, placement of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, which could be removed after 24 hours, with subsequent hemodynamic stabilization.
The patient also presented complete atrioventricular block, recovered within less than 48 hours, and perioperative atrial fibrillation, which was managed with an intravenous amiodarone regimen.
When he was already in the hospital ward, he presented with sepsis of probable respiratory origin, requiring prolonged treatment with intravenous meropenem and vancomycin for 3 weeks.
After a prolonged hospitalization with slow physical rehabilitation due to the significant loss of muscle mass, the patient is finally discharged from hospital, with controls by Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.
