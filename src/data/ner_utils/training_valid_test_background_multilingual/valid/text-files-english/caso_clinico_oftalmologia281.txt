A six-year-old patient who came to the Ophthalmology Department complaining of decreased visual acuity in the left eye of approximately one month of evolution, and ocular redness that he had at the time of consultation did not.
The patient did not report any personal or pathological antecedents of interest.
His only epidemiological history of interest was that he liked to play with dogs, cats and other domestic animals, although he did not live with them at home.
Initial evaluation: visual acuity (VA): 1.0 left eye (LE): 0.1.
Motility intrinsic and intrinsic: normal in eyes(A/O).
Pathogenic variant: normal A/O.
Anterior segment apex: No signs of ocular inflammation A/O.
Posterior segment palliative care: normal-OD.
OI- Haze vitreous 2+.
Peripheral granuloma is observed at hour 3 with a small perilesional perilesional retinal tear.
From this granuloma emerges a fibrous band to the optic disk, which tractions all the affected retina including macular area, and causes a heterotocopy of the macula, thus establishing the clinical diagnosis of Toxocariasis Ocular.
Blood and urine tests were ordered and the patient's general examination was normal, ruling out systemic toxocariasis.
Treatment consisted of anticholinergic agents (EIAs) administered systemically to control vitreous inflammation and focal laser photocoagulation in the degenerative disc.
The results obtained were favorable; the inflammation of the posterior segment disappeared, the tear is treated with a good laser effect.
It still maintains minimal residual peripheral granuloma.
The patient is followed up by an Ophthalmology outpatient clinic every six months.
Histopathology is occasionally performed on biopsy and autopsy specimens, but is not routinely used.
Other exposed eggs found in feces (Ascarisotrichuris) indicate that the child has been contaminated with feces on the ground and support a diagnosis of toxocariasis.
