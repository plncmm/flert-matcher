Anamnesis A 29-year-old male patient with no previous family or medical-surgical history of interest, or relevant home medication who presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back, progressive weight gain of about 9 kg.
At this time, the patient came to the emergency department twice, being discharged after no warning signs or laboratory abnormalities were found.
In the month of December 2017, he came again with greater clinical deterioration and tension ascites.
Then, admission for study in Digestive was studied.
Physical examination revealed that the patient was in good general condition, although her thinness and appearance of disease were striking.
Ascites, ascites, tension ascites, diffuse mass without peritoneal irritation, or enlarged spleen were evident in the abdominal palpation.
No lymph node involvement was observed, and no other relevant findings were observed in the examination by the equipment.
▁Complementary tests Serial laboratory tests performed during admission showed no alterations other than CRP and LDH slightly elevated.
The proteinogram and all viral serology performed (including HIV, hepatotropic, CMV, EBV, herpesvirus and parvovirus) were also normal.
Ascitic fluid after paracentesis showed no tumor cells or other significant data.
Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic▁epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme
A marked thickening with increased multinodular density of the greater omentum was also observed. Upper endoscopy (EDA) was also requested, which revealed a lesion in the gastric body with ulcerated lesion measuring 4 cm.
In the settlement, along the path of the end, there were several areas of compression of the mucosa that impressed that could correspond to peritoneal implants.
Samples were taken for biopsy of the findings found in EDA and anaesthesia, both with negative result for malignancy.
In this case, the diagnosis is obtained by biopsy of an axillary lymph node.
Diagnosis The pathological study concluded: lymphatic node with positivity neuronal membrane as well as malignant tumor suggestive of small and round cell tumor (TDCPR) supported by▁immunohistochemical study with positive expression of focal CKAE gene for epithelial antigen vila
With these data, the patient is finally diagnosed with intraabdominal TDCPR stage IV due to pleural, polyadenopathic, peritoneal and bone involvement.
Treatment After discharge, the patient was evaluated in the outpatient clinic of Ontario and Palliative Care Unit of our Hospital for assessment and treatment.

The patients exposed condition started treatment in January 2018.
To date, she has received four cycles with good tolerance, no relevant toxicities (only grade 2 nausea), no laboratory abnormalities that have led to delays in cycles or dose reduction.
After the second cycle, the patient came to the emergency department due to increased cough, sudden dyspnea and general▁malaise. The infectious process was catalogued and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was previously ruled out.
Up to the present day, four paracentesis evacuators have been required, with extraction of each of them showing 8 episodes with subsequent clinical improvement.
Mantain EC type 1.
A reassessment CT was performed, which showed partial response of the disease.
Pending still receiving the two remaining cycles until completing six.
