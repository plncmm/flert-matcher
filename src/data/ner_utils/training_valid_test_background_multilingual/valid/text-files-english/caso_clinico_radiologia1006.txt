An 80-year-old male presented with massive hemoptysis and was intubated.
Rx shows a ball inside a cavity in the right upper lobe (increasing air sign) pathognomonic of a mycetoma (also called aspergilloma).
A Rx in lateral decubitus can demonstrate the fungic ball changing position.
In this condition, a preformed cavity is colonized, usually by Aspergillus fumigatus.
Cavitary disease can be secondary to fibrotic lung disease, e.g. prior TBC, sarcoidosis, or ankylosing spondylitis.
Massive hemoptysis can occur and bronchial angiogram with embolization is temporary.
Surgical resection is definitive, but bronchopleural fistula can occur.
Unfortunately, most patients have insufficient pulmonary reserve to allow surgical resection.
