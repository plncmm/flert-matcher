24-year-old patient, single child, born in an industrial city of medium size.
No personal or family history of interest.
From childhood onwards, she manifested herself as a solitary child, little expressive, reserved, without excessive activity and with little interest in the studies, who left at 16 years of age, starting shortly after working in the construction, who has always dedicated herself irregularly.
At 15 years of age, the use of different substances began, starting with cannabis, alcohol and cocaine.
The few friendships they had for that time ended up following constant inadequate conducts in the context of toxics and consumption.
She has never had a steady partner relationship, which says she is not‚ñÅworried about, nor about sexual relations.
Ambivalent and distant with their parents and without any contact with the rest of their family.
For several years the consumption that has maintained, fundamentally, is that of cannabis, smoking "during the whole day".
She had two psychiatric admissions at that time, being diagnosed with psychotic disorder due to substance use, not subsequently maintaining adequate therapeutic follow-up and returning to use soon afterwards.
In the update, consciousness is a new entrance due to similar symptoms, in which there is little structured discourse, delusional ideation of reference, persecution and prejudice, constant interpretations of the megairantes, manifestations of type.
He was very annoyed with his parents on his arrival, manifesting that he did not wish to maintain contact with them since then.
With management difficulties at the beginning of admission in relation to psychotic symptoms, the referred clinic was yielding in a few days, appearing criticism of all previous approaches, showing itself adequate and collaborating.
It was equally evident throughout this period, its usual way of functioning, very little related to the other patients or staff of the unit, relating it a lot with personal issues, maintaining an emotionally distant contact and only considering interventions in relationships.
She was diagnosed with psychotic disorder due to substance use and schizoid personality disorder, maintaining treatment at hospital discharge with 3 mg of risperidone.
Given the symptomatology and vital difficulties that the cannabis consumption had provoked in the patient, we worked with him the need to maintain after discharge a dual program of dishabituation, approach and treatment of the affected baseline problems favored this approach.
A one-month admission to a dual diagnosis unit was performed, followed by outpatient treatment.
Six months later, the patient has restarted partially supervised work, maintaining abstinence and presenting an "acceptable", although poor relationship with his programmates as well as with his parents.
