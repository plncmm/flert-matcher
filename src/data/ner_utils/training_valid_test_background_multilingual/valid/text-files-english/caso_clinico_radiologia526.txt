A 49-year-old male, HIV+, was referred for urgent abdominal CT because of suspected intestinal obstruction.
Significant dilation of intestinal loops with the "sign of feces" grouped in the right hemiabdomen.
Poor definition of some segments of the distal ileum with hypodense wall, probably due to hypoperfusion.
Moderate amount of free peritoneal fluid
‚ñÅTerminal ileus and large intestine of normal caliber.
These findings are compatible with mechanical obstruction of the small intestine, probably due to internal hernia, signs of vascular compromise.
