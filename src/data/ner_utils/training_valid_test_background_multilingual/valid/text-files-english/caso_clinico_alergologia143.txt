We describe a clinical case of a 10-year-old male who was followed up in the Child Allergy Clinic since 3 years of age for persistent extrinsic asthma.
Five years later, she presented with allergic rinitis, detected as opposed to olive pollen and salsola, requiring immunotherapy for both evolution and after 4 years, suspending the same.
During follow-up she presents several episodes of urticaria and angioedema attributed to various foods such as nuts and citrus fruits.
Oral teasing against citric acid (mandarin) was performed with negative results.
At 9 years of age, after ingestion of an aceitune offered by his father who was eating nuts, he presented with urticaria and angioedema.
Oral provocation was performed against aceitune, which was diagnosed as anaphylaxis by aceitune, presenting symptoms of palatal pruritus, nasal pruritus, cough, respiratory distress and wheezing that began immediately after ingestion.
Skin test against standardized extract of aceituna and prick by prick against negative aceitune.
Pending completion of the study by immunoblot at the present time.
