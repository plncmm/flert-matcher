- MARCADORES TUMORALES: Antí © Sociedad Colombiana de Anestesiología y Reanimación (CEA); CA 125 and Ca 19.9:
- GASTROSCOPIA: A large ulcerated mass in the lesser curved neoplasic appearance with biopsies of the area underneath.
- PATOOLOGICAL ANATOMY: Positive gastric biopsy for adenocarcinoma.
- ABDOMINO-PÉLVICO TAC: Mass at the lowest curved level of the stomach, with lymphadenopathy of the gastroheptic ligament, celiac trunk and portocaval space.
- ABADOMINAL ECOGRAPHY: Hepatic hemangioma in segment V. - TORACIC TAC: No evidence of disease.
Diagnosis Locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma cT2 (dudosa M1 by retroperitoneal lymph nodes by CT).
Treatment In the Committee for Gastroesophageal Tumors, it was decided that in the presence of an intervention, if it was diagnosed with radiation therapy and if lymphadenopathy began, a new PET-CT would be requested to see the behavior of the lymph nodes; if they were taken as readjuvant
- PET-CT (02/03/2011): Gastric uptake is observed without capturing retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
28/2011 started with the first cycle of Neoadjuvant QT with Cisplatin (75 mg/m2), Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (MTF/m2).
Ev.▁~~~ A seizure 5 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy showed significant toxicity, with enteritis and prerenal renal failure, anemia requiring transfusion and mucositis.
Genetic analysis was performed for mutations in enzymes catabolizing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), obtaining as a heterozygous result for MTHFR C677T which gives it an intolerance to 5-FU.
CPT-11 regimen (Irinotecan 125 mg/m2) weekly is changed to another aetiology by administering 4 doses from 1 April to 22 April, with moderate tolerance as hepatic enzymes begin with hyperrubinemia
At one month after the end of the CT, the patient returned to the office without the Medical Consultation with Analysis, where only mild anemia with Hb of 11.1, improvement in liver function and negative tumor markers were observed, with a CT scan showing adenopathy in the stomach and PET.
For all this, it is defined as a stable disease, adenopathies due to a history of HIV disease and not to the tumoral disease, so it is decided to perform a surgical intervention.
On June 13, 2011, 70% underwent partial gastrectomy, D2 lymphadenectomy and omentectomy.
The pathological study showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and moderately differentiated areas, affecting the muscle layer, with free resection margins and 47 lymph nodes free of metastasis.
▁Definitive staging ypT2 ypN0.

Because of the poor tolerance to chemotherapy, it was decided not to give adjuvant chemotherapy, and since then it became controls.
Currently, there is no evidence of disease 5 years after surgery, with annual monitoring with CT, analysis and tumor markers.
