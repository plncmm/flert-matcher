A 78-year-old man with probable allergy to mercury, smoker, occasional alcohol consumption and history of: hypertension, dyspituitary 2003 (Acentins with persistent polyoxychorionic hypercoagulated Achilles Acidosis), recurrent hypercoagulated with another 2VAS (Paroxychoroid Acentinopathy with acyclosis),
She was admitted with fever and hematuria for two days without voiding syndrome or other infectious symptoms.
Physical anodyne.
Analytically it highlights leukocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants and hypertransaminasemia, urine sediment with hematuria without pyuria or proteinuria.
It is interpreted as a possible febrile UTI and Ceftriaxone is initiated after Urocultive and Hemocultive collection.
Renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
New cultures were extracted and Piperacillin/Tazodone was scaled due to persistent fever.
BK and PCR for tuberculosis in urine were negative; CT a non-pelvic, normal; MR prostate without abscesses, although with a PI-RADS 4 nodule (so called malignant abscess).
Urine cytology showed no atypia.
Culture negativity is suspended antibiotic therapy.
Reinterrupted, he reported myalgias in both thighs (intense during fever peaks) and began with bilateral lower limb edema during hospitalization, predominantly right lower limb edema with Doppler-US.
MRI right thigh, suggestive of myositis.
She had normal CK levels, and Aldolase was requested, which was elevated.
Negative immunological study (including Immunoglobulins, ANA, ENA, Anti-DNA, FR, Anti-CCP, myopathy profile, Anti-HCGGCoA-MBPR3, ANCA).
Normal analytical residual (including C3, C4, Cryloglobulins and Proteinogram).
Serology negative (HCV, HBV, HIV, R.conorii, B.burgdoferi, Rosa Bengala, Toxoplasma, CMV, T.spiralis, E.histolytica).
A right thigh biopsy was performed and Prednisone was started at 1mg/kg/d, with fever disappearance and analytical improvement.
PA: inconclusive.
With the decrease in corticoid doses, new increase in acute phase reactants, leukocytosis, hypertransaminasemia and elevation of Aldolase (normal KC).
EMG: normal.
A new biopsy (left thigh external vein): compatible with Nodosa Polyarteritis.
We continued with descending corticosteroids and associated Azathioprine, with good clinical and analytical evolution at the time.
It would be a PAN with only muscle involvement.
