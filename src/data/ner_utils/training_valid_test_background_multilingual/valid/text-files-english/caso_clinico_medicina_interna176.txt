We report the case of a 61-year-old Ecuadorian male, obese, type 2 diabetic, recently born in Equatorial Guinea with fever, voiding syndrome and hyperglycemia.
The physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and enlarged spleen 10 cm.
Blood tests showed: leukocytes 9,100/μl, lymphocytes 62.8%, hemoglobin 9.8 g/dl, MCV 82.4, Platelets 78,000/μl, glucose 692 mg UGT/dl
Abdominal CT confirmed hepatomegaly with portal hypertension (PHP), idiopathic hypercholesterolemia 16 cm and peripancreatic adenopathy.
Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL grew in urine culture.
The thick smear was negative with positive PCR and serology 1/640 for P. falciparum, positive HCV serology with viral load 6.153,616 IU/ml.
Imipenem-cylastine, Dihydroartemisin/Piperaquine were prescribed and glycemic control was achieved with insulin and serum therapy with clinical and analytical improvement.
The patient met criteria for HMD: stenosis > 10 cm, IgM and elevated titers of antimalarial antibodies and positive PCR for P. falciparum.
Percutaneous lymphocyte count was performed by bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood cytometry, which showed a low splenic level B-cell lymphoma of the marginal zone.
This lymphoma is related to chronic HCV infections.
HMD has also been associated with▁lymphoproliferative disorders.
The association between the appearance of lymphomas and chronic antigenic stimulation by other infections such as H. pylori, EBV or HHV has been confirmed.
In this patient, three interrelated etiologies of stenosis of the esophagus (EMH, lymphoma, HTP) are recognized, which require high clinical suspicion and specialized tests.
Another point of interest is the possibility of remission of lymphoma and sickle cell disease with treatment for HCV and malaria.
The patient decided to return to his country and permanent prophylaxis for malaria with chloroquine, HCV treatment and laboratory tests were recommended.
