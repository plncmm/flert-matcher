A 59-year-old man was admitted in September 2008 with a diagnosis of postoperative chylothorax.
A history of sigma cancer, performing liver metastasectomy in July 2008 and since then several chylothorax evacuators were performed (approximately extracted volume: 9,000 mL).
On admission, he reported asthenia, discomfort in the right hemithorax and mild respiratory distress.
Pleural effusion occupying two thirds of the right hemithorax was radiologically observed.
After pleural drainage, 500 mL of fluid was obtained from a quotient-looking fluid within the first 24 hours, whose analysis was compatible with chylothorax3: cholesterol (COL) 60 mg/dL, pleural triglycerides (TG).
Conservative treatment was decided with absolute diet and chest drainage, consulting the Nutrition Area to start parenteral nutritional support.
Nutritional assessment showed a 4% weight loss in the last two months (usually 74 kg; current 71 kg), albumin 2.6 g/dL, transferrin 154 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.6 mg/dL.
He had slight loss of fat and muscle mass, together with reduced functional capacity in the last weeks; absence of edema, malleo-fat and signs or symptoms of specific subcutaneous deficit at home.
Dietary history without recent changes.
The nutritional situation was compatible with mild protein-energy malnutrition. The following plan of nutritional care was proposed: • Objectives: To maintain at rest the gastrointestinal acoustic tract and prevent a higher degree of malnutrition in a patient with high nutritional needs kcal.
• Composition of the parenteral nutrition formula (PN): Volume 2,500 ml; 120 g of amino acids; 300 g of glucose; 60 g of lipids (MCT/LCT); 2280 kcal total; vitamins and oligoelements
Despite treatment, pleural drainage remained stable in the first days, with a chylous appearance persisting.
The ultrasound showed loculated pleural effusion resulting in 200,000 IU urokinase for two consecutive days by the digestive endoscopy tube.
Because of persistent abundant chylous drainage, it was decided to start treatment with octreotide 100 mcg/8h subcutaneously.
Drainage was progressively reduced in the following days, changing to a serous aspect.
At the same time, the patient's general condition worsened, with abdominal disfunction, oliguria and hyperglycemia.
Suspicion of adverse reaction to octreotide was discontinued on day 4.
Biochemistry showed anemia (hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL; hematocrit 28.8%), leucopenia (2,390 leukocytes/microliters), thrombocytopenia (48,000/microliters), urea 59 mg/dL, total creatinine 0.6 mg/dL
After discontinuation of octreotide, pleural drainage continued to decrease, to a reduction of 50 mL/24h, maintaining the serous aspect.
On day 19 of admission mixed feeding was started using mixed feeding (NE) with fat formula (Clinut®; 1.25 kcal/mL; 13%dura proteins or diet with fat mL, juices or herbal teas).
In subsequent days, NE increased progressively up to 50% of estimated calorie needs (1,000 mL/day), diet was progressed with the introduction of roasted bread, skimmed-milk powder, gutted white fish or bread,
At the same time, the number of requests for PN was reduced.
On day 22, after 48 hours with no changes in pleural drainage, the sigmoidoscopy and PN were removed.
The nutritional evolution was favorable, with a gain of 2 kg, not being able to objective improvement in visceral proteins in the persistence of high CRP (15.7 mg/dL).
At discharge, the patient was advised to follow the same diet supplemented with a spoonful of sopera per day (10 g) sunflower oil to prevent essential fatty acid (AGE) deficiency.
