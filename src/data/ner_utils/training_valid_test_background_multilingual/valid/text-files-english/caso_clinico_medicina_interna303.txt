Consultation address: A 21-year-old woman was admitted for progressive loss of strength in the left lower limb.
Personal history: Allergy to milk, egg, kiwifruit and freak.
NAMC.
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Repeated bronchitis.
The patient was operated on 12 years later for a left pleural empyema after pneumonia.
Current disease: Fever, cough and expectoration of 15 days of evolution, which partially improved with bronchodilator and antibiotic treatment.
He began to experience weakness in the left lower limb, which progressively worsened and was admitted to Neurology for this reason.
Physical location: Hemodynamically stable.
Afebril.
Slim.
Multiple lesions are seen in both hands, hyperkeratotic lesions in the neck, abdomen and▁thorax.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral rhoncus and rhonchi up to midfields.
Heart failure, abdomen and lower limb edema were normal.
Neurologically: Claudication of left extremities in the ̄ and MingazziniÆs syndrome.
In the left upper limb, proximal strength was 4/5 and distal strength was 4-/5.
In the left lower limb, proximal strength was 4/5 and distal strength was 2/5.
Generalized hyperreflexia with increased reflexogenic area.
Left Babinski.
▁Complementary tests normal blood count and coagulation.
Biochemistry: total proteins 5.1 gr/dl, normal rest.
Immunoglobins: IgG 476 mg/dl, IgA, IgE and IgM: normal.
IgG-1: 396; IgG-2.97, IgG-3.41, IgG-4.4.
Proteinogram: Hypogammaglobulinemia.
Lambda IgG monoclonal band in late-stage Gamma.
CSF: Inflammatory profile.
ADA 6 U/l.
Bandas: Pattern compatible with intrathecal synthesis of IgG in systemic disease.
▁Cytology: negative for malignancy.
Culture: negative.
Serology (HIV, ESR, loes and Borrelia): negative.
PCR JC virus: 331 copies/mm3.
Serology (HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, Brucella, Borrelia and Lues): negative.
IgG ESR and VZV positive.
HRCT: Findings compatible with viral infectious process.
Cranial CT: small right frontal and periventricular white matter hypodensity without enhancement after contrast administration.
Cranial MRI: Compatible as first possibility with CNS demyelinating disease.
Brain MRI with spectrogram: consistent data with clinical suspicion of PML.
Episodes of mental illness: Acute respiratory distress requiring admission to the ICU.
Over the course of the days, thermoalgesic sensitivity and strength worsening in the left upper limb are affected.
She was initially treated with methylprednisolone without improvement.
After receiving PCR for JC virus positive CSF, treatment with Cidofovir, intravenous immunoglubulins and mefloquine was started with little improvement.
Diagnostic Judgment - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
- Combined immunodeficiency, with hypogammaglobulinaemia due to IgG and IgM deficiency.
