A 57-year-old man presented with cough, dyspnea, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fever of up to 38.7 °C and abdominal pain of 8 days duration.
The trunk and thighs presented symmetrical and extensive livedo reticularis.
Analytical tests showed high values of C-reactive protein, ferritin and lymphocyte count.
A nasopharyngeal swab PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 and a chest CT scan showed multifocal ground-glass opacities suggestive of COVID-19.
Because of the unusual sudden onset of symmetrical livedo reticularis in a middle-aged man, additional tests for preconditions were performed.
Although antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANAs), pattern, thrombus, rheumatoid factor INR/APTT,▁cryoglobulins and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative, nuclear factor was positive transfer,
The previous value of antinuclear factor was unknown, and to date it has not been investigated whether COVID-19 can induce this type of antibodies.
Infectious causes of livedo, such as HIV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, syphilis, Legionella pneumophila, influenza A/B, RSV, hepatitis B/C were negative.
During 8 days, oxygen, acetaminophen, hydroxychloroquine and low molecular weight heparin were administered in a preventive regimen.
After discharge, livedo fluctuated but disappeared progressively.
At three weeks, the inflammatory parameters were normal (except by a very slightly high ferritin value), although the patient still suffered a slight exertional dyspnea.
