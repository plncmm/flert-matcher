He could move all limbs, but the upper limbs showed less mobility.
The osteotendinous reflexes were sudden and the plantar cutaneous reflex presented Babinski sign.
Initial analyses revealed Hb: 1 g/dL, leukocytes: 17,000 [lymphocytes: 1020/mm3, normal range: 800–5000 ng normal, VSG: 40 mg/L (normal ferritin: 20 mm/L).
CSF analysis revealed leukocytes: 0/mm3 (normal range: 0–5/mm3), glucose: 105 mg/dL (normal < 80 mg/dL) and proteins: 15 mg/dL (normal < 45 mg/dL).
CSF was negative for viruses, such as herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-
In addition, no oligoclonic bands were found in CSF.
The interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis and the ELISA assay for Brucella and HIV antibodies were negative.
Brain MRI showed diffuse confluent white matter hyperintensity on MRI with FLAIR, especially on the left side, with no prominent enhancement on T1-weighted sequences.
In addition, the involvement of the deep and cortical▁grey matter and the dorsal mesencephalon was evident.
A chest CT scan showed bilateral peripheral multifocal consolidations with air bronchogram consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RT-PCR assays from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, but these were negative in CSF.

8 mg three times a day, which led to an improvement in mental status after two days.
