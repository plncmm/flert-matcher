Anamnesis A 74-year-old male with the following personal history: no known allergic drug reactions; denies toxic habits; hypertension under treatment; type II diabetes mellitus; obesity; septic atrial fibrillation to tachycardia; septic shock - hypertensive - two years
She had been operated on for a left knee prosthesis 4 years ago.
She was operated on for bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy.
Usual treatment: enalapril 20 mg, tamsulosin, torasemide 5 mg, pramipexole, acenocoumarol 4 mg on regimen, allopurinol 300 mg, bisoprol mood disorder 20 mg, metformin
Physical examination revealed arterial hypertension 164/97 mmHg, heart rate 69 bpm, temperature 37.5 oC.
Awareness and guidance on three
Mucocutaneous dryness.
Heart attack, mental illness, and noiseless sounds
The vesicular auscultation was preserved with mucus and no adventitious sounds.
Abdominal air-fluids present and of normal intensity.
The abdomen was blandom and depressible, painless to palpation, with no signs of peritonitis, no signs of mass or enlargement.
▁Right inguinal hernia irreductible right side, irreducible left inguinal hernia.
bilateral renal failure was negative.
Rectal examination: prostate with regular edges, no pain, no feces in the rectal ampulla.
Lower limbs showed no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
▁Complementary tests ● Blood analysis: in which leukocytosis of 15.74 103/μl stands out, with neutrophilia (89.40%), increased acute phase reactants and deterioration of renal function with urea 7160 mg/dl.
Urine output was positive; pH 5.5, density 1.010 g/l, protein 20 mg/dl; glucose negative; leukocyte count was negative; bilirubin 0 mg/dl; urobilinogen negative; nitrites negative.
● Urgent sedation: > 100 leukocytes/field, isolated b-cells and bacteriuria.
● Hemocultiva and urocultiva: Multisensitive Escherichia coli.
Treatment The patient was diagnosed with complicated urinary tract infection, starting treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/12 hours, and was left under observation to assess the response to treatment, despite which persisted.
Given the patient's history, and the worsening of the patient's renal function, whose baseline serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl, it was decided to request an abdominal-pelvic ultrasound, which revealed a right portal hydrophrenic dilation in the right foot
In order to assess a possible compromise of the urinary tract as a cause of acute renal failure, it was decided to request a computed tomography, in which obstructive uropathy with hydronephrosis grade III was observed and there was significant dilatation of the right inguinal hernia.
The patient required hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy.
Diagnosis ● Febrile urinary tract infection
●▁Right Ureterohydronephrosis grade III due to herniation of the right ureter.
● Recurrent bilateral inguinal hernia.
Midline incisions were made in infraum months after the patient underwent surgical treatment, performing: ● Hernioplasty with a 30 x 30 polypropylene mesh by preperitoneal approach according to Stoppa technique, by intravesical incision.
● Catheterization of the right ureteral meatus with placement of a double J 6 x 30 catheter.
After surgery, the patient was discharged 4 days after the operation and had serum creatinine levels around 1.3-1.5 mg/dl.
In the early postoperative period, the patient developed a hematoma in the surgical region and edema.
Four weeks after surgery, a double J catheter was removed without incidents.
The evolution of the patient was satisfactory.
