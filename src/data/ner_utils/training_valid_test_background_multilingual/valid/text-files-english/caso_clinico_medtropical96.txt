We report the case of a 5-year-old girl from Guinea residing in Spain since 9 months before, who came to the emergency room for progressive pain in the left thigh with swelling, edema and functional impotence of 10 days of evolution.
Asthenia, unquantified weight loss and unthermal fever sensation during the last 2 weeks were associated.
Physical examination revealed painful swelling with non-fluctuating inflammatory characteristics of 6 x 6 cm in diameter in the anterior aspect of the left thigh, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathies of 2 x 2 cm deep subcutaneous adhering nodule.
Basic blood tests were performed in the emergency department. Eosinophil count showed normal leukocytes (2.6 %), muscle leukocytes (4.90%), hemoglobin 11.6 g/dl, hematocrit 35.2 %; neutrophil count 56.4 % normal.
The suspicion of tropical pyomyositis was decided to admit the patient to hospital.
Antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was initiated intravenously for 15 days, and then oral treatment was completed on an outpatient basis for 10 more days.
During admission, microbiological study was completed determining positive serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV), positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Plasmodium falciparum.
The abscess was surgically drained in the left hemiabdomen, with S. aureus being isolated.
The patient progressively developed fever and remission after 48 h. The inflammatory signs decreased until the patient completely recovered the functional capacity of the affected limb.
As occurred in our patient and although the ethiopathogeny of tropical pyomyositis is not perfectly established, according to many authors an initially localized infection would occur that if not adequately treated lymphedema, septic abscess or abscess would occur.
The cause of this possible dissemination is not clearly defined, but it has been related to tropical diseases such as filariasis, malaria, Dracunculus medinensis, etc., a fact that could cause an imbalance in the immune system Thuculus medinensis immune polarization.
