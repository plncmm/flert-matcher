A 25-year-old woman with a history of exposure to powdered acrylic for one year.
Symptoms began six months after exposure to dust, with infectious episodes treated with multiple antibiotics with partial reduction of the clinical picture.
She presented with worsening of the symptoms with progression of dyspnea to grade 2 on the Medical Research Council scale (MRC).6 Physical examination showed normal vital signs, temperature of 36.1 °C, normal blood pressure 100/70 breaths.
Arterial gasses in room air revealed pH 7.4, PO2 50 mmHg, PCO2 34 mmHg, SO2 75% and HCO3 24 mmHg.
Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were normal.
Spirometry and plethysmography showed a very severe restrictive pattern.
Volume (31%), residual volume (32%), first second (FEV1) 0.98 L (FEV1/FVC) 116%, predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) 0.99 L (26%) of predicted volume, 30 mL.
Pathological examination, including six minutes walked 350 m presenting dyspnea Borh 3-4 with saturation 89% with oxygen, since he presented saturation 72% ambient air. Expectoration cultures were negative in mycological examination, bacteriological examination
The chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and HRCT with thickening of the interlobular septa of bilateral peripheral predominance with cotton opacities in mu-sail and other glass opacities.
Fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) aspirating a vesicular material and foamy.
There were no endobronchial anomalies.
Lymphocytes, proteinaceous material and alveolar ma-cr were found by cytology.
Alveolar proteinosis was diagnosed.
Two LAB were performed in a period of three months with partial improvement of the clinical picture, so treatment with GM-CSF was started subcutaneously, without clinical improvement.
He is currently on LAB treatment every two to three months.
