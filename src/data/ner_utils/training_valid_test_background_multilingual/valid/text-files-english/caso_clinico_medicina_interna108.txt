A 56-year-old patient with a history of HIV infection and HCV copy type 4a was currently treated with tenofovir/emtricitabine and nevirapine, with good virological and immunological control (undetectable CV and CD).
The patient presented poor tolerance to treatment with interferon and rivabirin.
The last Fibroscan is compatible with a F1 stage (6.3).
The patient was admitted due to a cutaneous condition consisting of erythematous, macular and poorly defined lesions, with several days of evolution predominantly distal in extremities (short).
In the analyses, 13,240 leukocytes with 845 neutrophils stood out.
CRP 2.02 mg/dl.
Autoimmune study was requested: ANCA 1/40 (p-ANCA) and ANA 1/320 (homogeneous pattern) with normal complement C3, C4 and CH50,‚ñÅcryoglobulins and negative RF.
The HIV VC is undetectable and the HCV is 701188 IU/ml.
The results of skin biopsy are compatible with chronic perivascular liquenoid dermatitis with subepidermal vesiculation with neutrophils and vasculitic damage with focal leukocytoclasia.
The clinical picture is suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis so it is decided to start treatment with sobuvir and daclastavir presenting a favorable evolution with disappearance of the lesions.
