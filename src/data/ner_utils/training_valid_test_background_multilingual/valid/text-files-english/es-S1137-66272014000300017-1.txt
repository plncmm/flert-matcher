We report the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with a painful erythematous rash in the cervical region of 12 hours of evolution.
The patient was generally unwell, had no fever, respiratory symptoms or other added symptoms.
The patient had been evaluated 6 hours ago as a possible pretery and started treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antihistamines.
Physical examination revealed cutaneous erythema in the neck, armpits, chest and buttocks, with areas of cutaneous clearing in the axillary and cervical areas and a crusted lesion in the cervical region.
The patient also presented erythema and erythema and conjunctival inflammation, the rest of the physical examination being normal.
Heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure constants were normal.
Blood analysis showed leukocytosis (12,300 leukocytes/μL, normal formula) without elevation of acute phase reactants.
With a presumptive diagnosis of ESS, she was admitted to hospital and started treatment with cloxacillin IV, topical mupirocin, i.v. antihistamine, IV fluid therapy, and analgesia.
The evolution was initially unfavorable, with generalization of the lesions and extension of the▁erythrodermia.
On the third day, clindamycin IV was empirically associated with the treatment, with a very favorable evolution of the lesions observed 24 hours later.
Later the hemocultive was informed as negative and the culture of cutaneous and nasal swabs was positive for S. aureus (resistant to penicillin, sensitive to cloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and clinda).
After six days of hospitalization with parenteral treatment, it was decided to discharge the patient to continue antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis.
