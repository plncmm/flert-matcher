A 67-year-old man, with mild overweight and no relevant history, came to the emergency department with fever (37.8 °C) and mild respiratory symptoms.
After a diagnosis of COVID-19, he was sent home with hydroxychloroquine and mental retardation.
Five days later, the patient was readmitted to the emergency department with worsening of asthenia and fever.
Physical examination revealed anasarca, respiratory rate of 32▁rpm.
Atrial fibrillation is a rare condition that affects the lungs.
Oxygen saturation in ambient air was 87%.
A chest CT scan revealed bilateral ground glass opacities and a patchy pattern in the right lung.
C-reactive protein (114.1 mg/L, range 6 mg/L), fibrinogen (711 mg/dL, normal range 150-400 mg/dL) and normal range < 0.77 μg/mL) were elevated (1.83 μg/dL).
In addition, the association of hypootic albuminemia diagnostic 2 g/L, 50.7% of total serum protein), proteinuria (30 mg/dL, normal range 0-15 mg/dL) and anasarca syndrome due to nephrotic syndrome was consistent with
The patient was admitted to a COVID-19 facility and was treated with non-invasive ventilation, ceftriaxone and enoxaparin 6000 IU anti-Xa once a day as antithrombotic prophylaxis.
During the first 48 hours, the patient showed no further worsening.
However, as from the third day of admission, a progressive increase in the number of thrombocytes (443 x 109/L), of sickle cell disease (3.73 μg/mL), and of C-reactive protein (229 mg/mL) was observed.
Consequently, the patient was intubated and transferred to a COVID-19 ICU.
On day 5, the patient developed pain, numbness and cold in the right lower limb, as well as a large increase in the number of tenderness (> 20 μg/mL).
A double ultrasound showed complete occlusion of the right iliac and popliteal arteries, for which urgent revascularization of the lower limb was performed under general anesthesia.
A 20G catheter was inserted into the right radial artery to monitor invasive blood pressure.
To achieve an ACT greater than 250 seconds, three boluses of 1000 IU of IV UFH were required.
after an initial dose of 5000 IU.
To maintain the goal of ACT, 6000 IU more of UFH were added.
Conventional thrombectomy was successfully performed in the right lower extremity, with a Fogarty catheter in several approaches (femoral and subgenicular popliteal).
A double intraoperative ultrasound showed a biphasic flow pattern in the treated arteries.
During surgery, sudden flattening of the arterial wave and coldness of the right upper limb were indicative of limb ischemia.
Clinical suspicion was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound, which detected thrombosis of the right coronary artery.
Consequently, a right upper extremity thrombectomy was successfully performed, which restored the permeability of the humble artery.
The patient was discharged from the operating room with a continuous infusion of 1000 IU/h of UFH.
It is worth noting that aPTT ratio of 1.92 was obtained only with an increase in the rate of UFH infusion at 2000 IU/h (three5,000 IU/day).
However, the aPTT ratio dropped to 0.86 during the first postoperative day, leading to an additional increase in UFH.
The next day, the occurrence of reactive thrombocytosis explained a reduction in the aPTT ratio of 2.54 to suboptimal values.
As the anti-Xa factor test gave a value below the therapeutic value (0.34 IU/mL), a regimen of UFH of 8000 IU twice a day was started.
During the following two days, the Δημητ decreased to 0.72 μg/mL and the anti-Xa activity was between 0.60 and 0.77 IU/mL.
During this period, a high dose of▁norepinephrine (0.25 μg/kg/min) was administered to treat hypotension.
On the sixth day, the patient presented persistent bilateral lower limb aischaemia, including coccysis in extremities of the fingers and toes, lower legs, and post-operative chromatinized double echocardiography.
Consequently, prostaglandin E-1 was administered to 60 mcg twice a day.
Five days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to be transferred to the COVID-19 facility. Twenty days later, he was discharged with oral anticoagulants.
At the two-month follow-up, there were no thromboembolic events.
A slow reduction was observed in the values of the digit D, from 3.3 μg/mL to 1.6 μg/mL.
Acroischemic lesions showed a gradual improvement without amputation and the patient is currently going to a wound healing twice a week.
