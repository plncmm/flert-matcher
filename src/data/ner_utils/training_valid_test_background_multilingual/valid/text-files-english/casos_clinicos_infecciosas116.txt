A 4-year-old girl with no relevant past medical history presented with painful left cervical swelling and fever (38oC), with few hours of evolution.
The day before, after complaining of pain at the occipital level, the parents observed a scalp tick that was removed manually.
Three days before, the child had been in a rural area in contact with animals.
On physical examination, a 1 cm erythematous plaque with a normal ipsilateral exanthema is observed on the tick bite area, in the left parietoccipital region, with a normal ipsilateral cervical swelling.
Plaque of 1 cm in diameter, with central necrosis after tick bite.
A complete blood count and biochemistry were performed with normal results, without elevation of acute phase reactants, and a cervical ultrasound showed lymphadenopathies of inflammatory characteristics, predominantly in the left laterocervical region, not greater than 3.2 cm.
Cervical ultrasound.
Adenopathy of 3.2 x 1.2 cm, inflammatory and non-accessified characteristics.
Was seated a picture of tick-borne lymphadenopathy or TIBOLA (the English acronym Tick-Borne Lymphadenopathy).
Treatment was initiated with oral contraceptives (5 mg/kg/day every 12 hours) in a short course of 2 days.
Both patients became afflicted in the first 24 hours, with progressive reduction of cervical adenitis until they became asymptomatic.
Serology was performed at diagnosis and at 6 weeks, in both cases, against Ritsia conorii and Borrelia burdorferi (only serology available in our area) with negative results.
