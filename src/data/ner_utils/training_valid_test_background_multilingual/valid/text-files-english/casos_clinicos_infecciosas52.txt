A 42-year-old male patient, born in Romania, residing in Spain for 10 years.
She works in construction, and for this reason she changes her residence to Equatorial Guinea during the last year, making trips to Spain every six months.
Among his antecedents, he stands out as a smoker of 20 cigarettes/day and drink about 20 grams of ethanol daily.
She was also vaccinated for tuberculosis in childhood.
During her stay in Africa she remains practically asymptomatic except for an episode of malaria diagnosed and treated on an outpatient basis (she did not undergo chemoprophylaxis against this disease).
She had no contact with animals, drank unbottled water, consumed local dairy products, and had not bathed fresh water either.
After a year he returns to Spain for the second time, and after staying in our country for seven days, travels to Romania to visit his relatives.
A week after▁arriving to his country of origin, he began with a flu-like illness consisting of fever and arthroalgia, scarce cough, purulent discharge, night chest pain asthenia, 5 kilograms non-resectoration.
After a month in Romania, he returned to Spain.
Upon arrival, the patient was seen in Primary Care due to persistent symptoms.
He was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for seven days, but in the absence of improvement he came to our hospital.
Physical examination revealed asthenic, eupneic habits, with axillary temperature of 39oC, blood pressure of 93/60 mmHg, heart rate at 90 bpm, and basal oxygen saturation of 97%.
Weight: 55 kg.
The patient had oropharyngeal muguet and did not have peripheral adenopathies.
Cardiac auscultation was normal, but respiratory auscultation showed decreased breath sounds in both lung bases with moist crackles in the right base.
The abdomen was blushing to the apex, non-painful, with slight hepatomegaly of smooth edge, without masses or signs of peritoneal irritation.
Lower limbs showed no edema or deep venous thrombosis.
Neurological examination was normal.
0.9% Initial complementary tests were: • CBC: Hemoglobin 6.9 mg/dL, haematoma 21.3%, MCV 92.83%, MCHinfo 3pituitary cells (9% platelets 112.mm3, Leuco).
• Biochemistry: Glucose 58 mg/dL, Creatinine 0.45 mg/dL, Sodium 135 meq/L, Potassium 4 meq/L, Urea 28 mg/dL, ALT 2074 IU/L
• Coagulation: normal.
• Chest X-ray: Infiltered in the right upper lobe with associated atelectasis.
• Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 100 bpm, with normal axis and no changes in ventricular conduction or repolarization.
Differential diagnosis In summary, this is a patient who consulted for febrile syndrome, arthromyalgias and deterioration of the general state of one month of evolution, with associated respiratory infectious clinic.
The laboratory tests detected anemia, thrombopenia and hypoglycemia, as well as an infiltrate in the right upper lobe on the chest X-ray.
An epidemiological history of return to Spain after a long stay in Equatorial Guinea 6 weeks before and who had not undergone malaria chemoprophylaxis was highlighted in the anamnesis.
The initial differential diagnosis should focus on febrile syndrome in a patient from a tropical area, paying special attention to those etiologies that cause pulmonary involvement.
Malaria is the most important disease to rule out in travelers with fever when returning from the tropics, especially if the patient comes from an endemic area such as sub-Saharan Africa.
In some series malaria accounts for up to 30% of febrile episodes in▁travellers from this region of the world.
Patients often also present nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, voiding or respiratory symptoms, in the latter case mimicking lower respiratory tract infections.
Severe malaria can present pulmonary infiltrates due to the disease itself and bacterial superinfection (complicated malaria).
Manifestations associated with sepsis are common, with anemia being detected in 41% of cases and thrombopenia in 62-83%.
Hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose < 40 mg/dl) is included as one of the severity criteria for imported malaria.
If we studied cases of fever in▁travellers returning from the tropics, 11% of them presented clinical signs of respiratory infection.
In the etiological study of travelers, bacterial and viral infections (frequently due to meningitis, tuberculosis, Lölioffler syndrome, memimdiiasis, fever and meningitis) should be considered.
In our patient, we performed studies to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, since he had a suggestive upper lobe of the right lung and an associated constitutional picture that could be compatible with this diagnosis.
For long-stay travelers such as this case, the incidence of tuberculosis can be as high as for residents of endemic countries.
Cases of melioidosis with pulmonary involvement with lesions and cavities in the upper lung lobes similar to those of tuberculosis have been described, but this disease is endemic to Southeast Asia and Oceania.
Histoplasmosis also produces pulmonary histoplasmosis and is endemic in some areas of Africa (ade des tapered in America and some regions) but our patient did not refer to activities in grottos and more common Asia.
Typhoid fever can also be accompanied by respiratory symptoms, although the patient denied untreated water consumption, and did not present abdominal symptoms.
He did not present fever and respiratory symptoms that initially led us to suspect lithiasis.
Hantaviruses also cause fever and respiratory involvement, but their evolution is usually rapid to severe distress.
Another etiology to consider is the traveler's syndrome of the tourist class, as thromboembolism may occur as isolated fever (14% of cases).
Regarding the study of the febrile syndrome around the tropics, it is essential to collect in the clinical history the exposures and risk activities that may be associated with potential infections.
In our case, our patient did not report having been bathed in freshwater areas (rios, lakes...) in Equatorial Guinea, so the schistosomiasis leptospirosis (Katay fever) are less likely.
She reported having had at-risk sexual contacts that suggested acute HIV infection or the transmission of other STDs.
Nor had dairy products consumed without causing fever due to brucellosis.
He had no rashes (which suggested infection by Ritsias or Borrelia), skin rash or haemorrhagic manifestations (which suggested dengue or any other hemorrhagic virus).
Concluding positive previous clinical, epidemiological and analytical orientative data are carried out in parallel: • rapid malaria diagnosis test (panmalarial and P. falciparum atypical forms)
• Phrotis (extracranial): microcytosis, isolated thrombocytopenic purpura, intrametrocytic urticaria, compatible with Plasmodium falciparum and extraerythrocytic forms.
Parasitemia degree: 8-10%.
She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria with severity criteria. Intravenous treatment (iv) was performed with artesunate (4 doses of 180 mg at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours).
At 24 hours the patient was afflicted with parasitemia and the parasitemia was diagnosed in 1% (undetectable at 48 hours).
Dehydroquine fixed at day 9 of Internal Medicine, with fever and arthromyalgia resolved, and she completed sequential treatment with 3 tablets of Eurartesim® oral for 360 days (120 mg).
In addition to the above, since the patient was admitted to the hospital emergency room, respiratory isolation measures were taken, as the possibility of pulmonary tuberculosis infection was ruled out.
Treatment with ceftriaxone 2 gr/24 hours was started due to the possibility of being a malaria with pneumonic process, and later modified piperacillin-/8h internal medicine with complicated pneumonia in venous lobule with cavitation.
Mantoux was negative (0 mm) and despite inducing sputum, only one sample was obtained in which bacilloscopy was negative.
Fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy was performed, revealing the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the aspirated lung.
Antituberculosis treatment was initiated with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and etambu (RHZE) adjusted for antibiotic weight0/225/1.200/825 mg/day), with good tolerance.
The first 3 weeks of treatment in respiratory isolation due to the impossibility of performing it at home remained hospitalized.
During admission, other analytical results were received: • Serologies for HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, syphilis, and Schistosoma: negative.
• Blood culture: negative.
• Blood microfilariae study (saponin test): negative.
• Parasites in▁faeces (3 samples) and urine (1 sample) with concentration techniques: negative.
After 2 months of treatment with 4 drugs, the patient had a favorable clinical evolution, being asymptomatic in the outpatient review, with a gain of 8 kg.
There was also a notable improvement in laboratory and radiological findings.
Treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid was continued for 4 months, as resistance mutations to these drugs were not detected and the mycobacterial culture antibiogram showed no resistance to any of the first-line drugs tested.
During follow-up, no side effects were observed due to treatment with artemisin derivatives, such as hepatitis and, above all, hemolytic anemia secondary to the administration of artesunate.
Final diagnosis • Plasmodium falciparum malaria with severity criteria (paramia 8%-10%).
• Pulmonary tuberculosis
