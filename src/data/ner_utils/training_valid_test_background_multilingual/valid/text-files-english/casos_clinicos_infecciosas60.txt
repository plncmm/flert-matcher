We report the case of a 66-year-old woman whose most relevant medical-surgical personal history included: the absence of known allergic drug-related adverse reactions; Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) long-standing diabetes mellitus with portal hypertension
The patient underwent cholecystectomy in 2002 and underwent surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, well differentiated and located in 2012, with lymph node dissection under follow-up by the maxillofacial surgery service.
The patient came to the emergency department in February 2015 with progressive loss of vision, accompanied by pain in the nasal, periorbital and left frontal regions for three weeks.
She reported a fever of 38oC in the last week.
The examination showed a reddish area on the periorbital region and left maxillary region, painful to palpation.
The left eye showed some degree of proptosis and ipsilateral pupil in reactive middle mydriasis.
The rest of the examination showed normal vital signs.
Differential diagnosis We are faced with a patient with acute and progressive episode of facial pain and fever, whose history is: immunosuppression with corticosteroids, type 2 DM and surgical intervention for lingual carcinoma.
Among the clinical entities that course with facial pain, trigeminal neuralgia would be a possible diagnosis, but unlikely due to the existence of fever.
The patient's neoplasic history should be taken into account, since facial pain could be a consequence of tumor recurrence with invasion of the paranasal sinuses, although the existence of fever, the absence of acute signs or constitutional symptoms are unlikely.
Bacterial sinusitis mainly by Pseudomonas spp.
fungal sinusitis caused by Aspergillus spp.
o Mucorales would be a very likely diagnosis taking into account the clinical picture and the patient's personal history.
Imperative colitis and clinical suspicion of rhinocerebral mucormycosis are performed urgently on the paranasal sinuses, where occupation of the maxillary, frontal and left nostrils is observed, as well as the left nostrils.
A thinning of the bony septa of the etham cells, floor of the orbit and the internal wall of the left maxillary sinus, with erosion of the latter, was observed.
There is increased attenuation of fat and soft parts of the left chewing space, with increased density in the left pterygopalatine fossa.
These findings would be related to an infectious-inflammatory process.
No evidence of intracerebral alterations.
At the same time, an urgent analytical study was carried out in which an already known microcytic and hypochromic anemia was observed in the blood count.
Leukocytes 11980 cells/microliter (normal: 4000-11000 cells/microliter) with absolute neutrophils 10850 cells/microliter (n: 2000-7500 cells/microliter).
Platelets 306,000 cells/ mm3 (n: 15 microlitre cells/ mm3)
Normal coagulation.
Biochemistry showed glucose 300 mg/dl (n: 70-100 mg/dl), urea 86.9 mg/dl (N: 7-18 mg/dl), creatinine 1.52 mg/dl (n: 0.6-1.4 mg/dl).
Sodium 125 meq/L (n: 136-145 meq/L) and Potassium 5 meq/L (N: 3.5-4.5 meq/L).
PCR 103 mg/L (n: 0-5 mg/L).
Venous gas sequestration showed metabolic acidemia with pH 7.20 (N: 7.35-7.45), PCO2 34 mmHg (n: 35-45 mmHg) and HCO3 15 mmol/L (n: 18-23).
In urine, the presence of a vesicular body is noted.
Otorhinolaryngological examination revealed an inflamed mucosa with necrotic▁patches of the entire septum and left nasal fossa floor.
In the inferior and middle turbinates there is necrosis with visible white▁patches.
A normal examination was performed.
In the same exploratory act and in view of the findings described that confirmed the initial diagnosis of suspicion, urgent surgical intervention is performed performing middle turbinectomy, excision of mucosa of the inferior turbinate, as well as septum and floor of the fossa.
A wide middle meatotomy was performed resecting the entire sinus mucosa, anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy, sphenoidotomy and resection of the diseased mucosa.
During the surgical procedure samples were collected and sent to the service of microbiology and pathology.
Once the emergency surgical intervention is performed, correction of underlying risk factors (patient's metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia) is initiated.
Similarly, concomitant intravenous empirical antifungal treatment was initiated with liposomal amphotericin B (5mg/kg/24 hours) and caspoline adjusted according to weight of 70 mg loading dose on the first day followed by 50 mg/24 hours.
A cranial MRI was requested as a control imaging test.
The Microbiology laboratory urgently reports the existence of a pathogen belonging to the order of Mucorales, Rhizopus spp.
Rhizopus oryzae was subsequently identified.
In addition, the Pathological Anatomy Laboratory reports angioinvasion and, therefore, findings compatible with mucormycosis.
The evolution of the patient is torpid due to the existence of difficult-to-control facial pain, which requires a new review by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, who request a new head CT.
The new test performed showed inflammatory changes secondary to previous surgery, without evidence of central nervous system involvement.
In the following days, the patient presents with abdominal pain and disorientation accompanied by diarrhea. The detection of Clostridium difficile toxin in▁faeces is positive, and directed treatment is initiated.
In the following 48 hours, the patient presented worsening of the clinical picture despite treatment, and died.
Final diagnosis Rhizopus oryzae rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
Nosocomial diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection.
Chronic metabolic acidosis and probable secondary to diabetic renal failure
