On February 3, 2020, a 2-month-old and 21-day-old boy, born on November 13, 2019, was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in the Han infant hospital in the province of China.
He had cough and wheezing for three days, with dyspnea in the last 12 hours, but without other symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Your mother took him to the emergency department.
The father, who had fever and cough for three days, was treated in another hospital for possible COVID-19.
In addition, the chest CT scan of the father performed in another hospital showed ground glass opacities in the lung, indicating the possibility of viral pneumonia.
The mother had no fever or cough, and did not live with other family members.
The patient's family neighborhood is about 15 km away from the majorist market in shellfish Huanan, Wuhan, and there is no family history of contacts with this market.
However, 5 people from the neighborhood where the patient resides had been diagnosed with COVID-19.
The child was born at term and on the first day was given anti-coughing vaccine (CGB).
The patient had no relevant family history of asthma.
On the first day of admission (day 1), physical examination revealed the following data: temperature 37 °C, respiratory rate 52 r.p.m., pulse 170 l.p.m., peripheral oxygen saturation of 89 kg S.m.
The cardiac examination was normal, but the signs of dyspnea were evident, and wheezing and coughing were evident with the tapering of the patient.
The abdomen was blandom and depresible, and there was no evidence of stenosis due to palpation; however, hepatomegaly due to stenosis was detected 2 cm below the costal margin.
Initial laboratory tests yielded the following results: white blood cell count 8.81 (normal range = 4-10) × 109/L; lymphocytes 6.14 × 109/L (normal range = 1-30.5); neutrophils 1.41 0.02 × 109/L (normal range = 108 × 109/L).
The serum immunoglobulin (Ig) profile was as follows: IgG▁3.9 g/L (normal range = 2.6-6.9); IgM 0.37 g/L (normal range = 0.26-1) and IgA 0.11 g/L range (0.68).
Analysis of subpopulations of peripheral lymphocytes, evaluated by flow cytometry, yielded the following results: Total T lymphocytes 66.2% (normal P = 55% to 78%); Cooperative T lymphocytes (CD3 + CD4+CD19 interval 324%).
In addition, the procalcitonin value was 2.0 ng/mL (normal value < 0.5).
Liver functional tests were normal.
Analytical tests for the detection of respiratory viruses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which included adenovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B2/3 virus positive and paragripal cohesion virus 1/ negative.
A chest CT scan revealed bilateral pulmonary infection and consolidation in part of the lower lobe of the left lung.
The arterial gas showed H/5.3 mmol/L the following results: pH 7.33, oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) 65 mm Hg, PaCO2 38 mm Hg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) 91%, EB ?5.5 mmol/L
As a result, severe pneumonia was diagnosed and at admission non-invasive continuous positive mechanical ventilation (CPP) was immediately applied.
Antibiotic treatment with ceftizoxime (50 mg/kg, IV) was initiated.
twice daily) as bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed.
Before the antibacterial treatment, venous blood and sputum samples were sent for culture, but 5 days later, the results were negative.
In addition, he was treated with IV gammaglobulin.
(IVIG, 2 g/kg body weight in 2 doses) and methylprednisolone (2 g/kg, twice daily for 3 days).
Although the result of the qRT-PCR assay of the pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was negative 26 hours after admission, inhaled interferon (0.5 million U/kg twice daily) was administered in sterile solution.
On day 5, due to the improvement in the patient's condition, PPC was removed and non-invasive pacemaker therapy was started.
Blood tests were repeated: leukocytes 4.60 × 109/L; lymphocytes 3.27 × 109/L; neutrophils 1.05 × 109/L;▁eosinophils 0.01 × 109/L; thrombocytes 416 × 109/L; hemoglobin 80 g.
Median telephone communication was obtained from the patients' parents who tested negative for their pharyngeal swabs by qRT-PCR in another hospital and whose mother's chest CT was normal.
On day 10, the patient had mild cough, no fever and no expectoration, and the pulmonary signs had improved.
However, a pharyngeal smear test was performed using qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with positive results.
The patient continued with symptomatic treatment.
On day 17, the patient did not develop fever or cough, the pulmonary signs were normal, and the antibiotic therapy was withdrawn.
Then, a pharyngeal smear test was performed using qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results.
On day 19, the pharyngeal smear test was repeated using qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results.
On day 20, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that lung infection was almost completely absorbed.
As a result, she was discharged from the hospital and continued home care with her mother for two weeks.
