Anamnesis A 51-year-old woman who consulted her primary care physician in April 2015 for self-palpation of a painless nodule in the left breast, as she referred from a year of evolution to the service, for which she was diagnosed
Personal Background: No medical or surgical history of interest.
Oral contraceptives for 8 years
Physical examination revealed a marked breast mass.
The right breast has a normal appearance while the left breast shows a fixed and hard tumor of approximately 10cm, attached to deep planes and very sensitive to skin.
Not known axillary lymphadenopathy.
▁Complementary tests » Bilateral mammography (14/04/2015): An 8 cm mass with ill-defined borders was identified in the left breast.
» Bilateral breast ultrasound (14/04/2015): Hypoechoic mass, heterogeneous solid content, imprinted on the nipple-areola complex, with apparent inconvenience.
No lymphadenopathy was identified.
» Breast MRI (03/05/2015): 8 cm mass located in the inner quadrants of the left breast, hypervascular, with marked enhancement and cutaneous involvement.
An 18mm lesion in the supero-internal quadrants of the contralateral breast of similar appearance.
Bilateral nonspecific axillary lymph nodes.
» Toxico-abdominal-pelvic CT (07/05/2015): No evidence of distant disease.
» Tumor Markers (07/05/2015): CEA 1.8, CA 15-3 5.4.
Diagnosis▁Right breast: Angiosarcoma (CD34+, CD31+).
Left breast: Angiosarcoma (CD34+, CD31+) HHV8 negative.
Absence of mutation in k-RAS and NRAS.
Ki67 25%.
Primary bilateral breast angiosarcoma.
Treatment: A first-time (26/05/2015), simple mastectomy of the left breast and quadrantectomy of the right breast, subsequently performed right mastectomy due to insufficient margins (23/06/2015).
PA: Angiosarcoma (CD31 and CD34 expression).
Ki67 20-25%.
Grade 2.
No vascular permeation or perineural isolation.
The case is presented in the committee of breast cancer diagnosed according to histology. The patient would receive adjuvant radiotherapy for what is being carried out, and was then treated on the left hemithorax due to the size of the tumor
It was decided not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy due to the low expected benefit.
Sepsis is defined as the start of patient follow-up.
The first CT scan performed for reassessment on 09/2015 showed the appearance of liver lesions in segment VI and VII and another of larger size in segment VI.
At this time, it was decided to start the first line of chemotherapy for advanced disease with paclitaxel 80mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, starting on October 16, 2015.
After four cycles of treatment, we performed the TAC-abdominopelvic response on January 31, 2016, which showed persistence of the hepatic lesions previously described, but with higher necrotic content translated into its interior.
The patient is well tolerated, although with grade 1 neurotoxicity.
After the administration of 7 cycles, on April 22, 2016, a new toraco-absorbent TAC showed mild disease progression at the level of two splenic lesions of new onset.
It was decided to complete the molecular study of the tumor in order to perform targeted treatment, non-resorptive ALK rearrangement or microsatellite instability, with MET amplification in only 10%.
A new line of treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was started in May 2016
