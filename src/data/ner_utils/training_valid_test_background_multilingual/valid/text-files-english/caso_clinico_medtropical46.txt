Female patient, 56 years of age, born and raised from the shapono of Niayope in Sierra de Parima (2o 47 ́21" N, 64o 13 ́55" W, Altituda: 885 ms referred to concomitant liver pain
Due to the clinical-epidemiological suspicion and the historical records of cases of hydatid disease in Venezuelan Guiana, it was decided to do serology to rule out this parasitosis.
For the serological diagnosis of both patients, the immunoenzymatic fraction (ELISA) assay with R-50 of an antigen of sheep hydatid cyst optical density was used to detect specific IgG antibodies (normal value D).
≤0.170).
With the same antigen, we performed "Western blot" (WB) for the detection of 6 specific molecules of 15, 20, 21, 29, 35 and 46 kDa.
(Antifical Path and Inhouse Protocol) Immunology Section of the Tropical Medicine Institute "Dr. Félix Pifano" (Colmenares et al., 2009).
The patient's serum IgG-Hidatidosis ELISA was positive for a D.O.
of 1.336.
This result was confirmed by WB, detecting 4 of 6 specific bands.
The right lobe was located in the aorta between the Hospital Universitario de Caraca (HUC), where an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed showing cystic images in the right hepatic lobe and a more detailed image in the left abdominal CT scan showed 19
The patient was medicated with Albendazole 800 mg daily for three months until the surgical moment, which was performed by laparoscopy using the technique of puncture, aspiration, instillation and respiration (PAIR).
The fluid extracted from hydatid cysts during surgery was citrine, possibly due to cell death due to medical treatment.
On microscopic examination (40X), numerous▁filamentous fungi without movement of the flammygerous cells were observed and measured 40 ganciclovir.
Morphobial and digestive endoscopy showed a mean total size of 40 μ, 24.96 μ leaf and 15.04 μ Mango de los Egan gel, characteristic of this type.
The patient was successfully treated with albendazole for three additional months and underwent post-operative tomographic control.
