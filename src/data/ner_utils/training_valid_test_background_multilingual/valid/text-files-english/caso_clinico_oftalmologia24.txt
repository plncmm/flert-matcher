We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with bilateral, painless and progressive decrease in visual acuity (VA) in the last 4 days.
In his anamnesis, he highlights that one week before the onset of symptoms, the patient suffered a flu-like illness with fever of 38.5° of 3 days without other associated symptoms.
There was no previous history of travel abroad, low-cooked meat or contact with animals.
The general examination was also anodyne, with no skin or other abnormalities found.
Pathological examination showed a VA of 0.15 in both eyes (AO) that did not improve with stenopeic.
In the anterior segment stood out the presence of AO positive (+).
Funduscopic examination showed bilateral optic disc edema, flu-like infiltrate in posterior pole, periflebitis areas affecting the posterior pole and, more markedly in the periphery – in the 360°, yellowish vascular peri-lumen columns
Discrete colitis localized in the periflebitis areas was observed.
suspecting a neuroretinitis, the following complementary tests were requested: complete blood count, basic biochemistry, sedimentation rate (SGA), C-reactive protein (CRP), chest X-ray and cranial computed tomography (CT).
The results showed a leukocytosis of 18,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils and a CRP of 0.1.
The rest of the tests were normal.
The patient was admitted in order to complete the study.
Complete biochemistry, coagulation, rheumatic tests, immunoglobulins, Mantoux intradermal reaction, proteinogram, gammaglobulins, ANA, ENA, ANCA and ACE HBV serology, toxoplasmosis HBV, toxoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis
To control the evolution, treatment with oral prednisone (40 mg in the morning, 20 mg in the afternoon), prednisone eye drops, diclofenac and cycloplegic was started.
In the first 7 days the VA progressed to 0.3 in the RE and 0.4 in the left eye (LE).
Posterior pole edema decreased and a macular star appeared in both eyes.
Periflebitis also decreased until almost disappeared and the oral corticosteroid dose was reduced.
Fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papilledema and slight contrast accumulation in the macular region of BE.
The addictall remained positive in the anterior chamber in BE.
Clinical suspicion of neuroretinitis was started to be treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours, a descending pattern of corticosteroids and the patient was discharged after a week to check the results of the treatment.
At 2 weeks VA improved to 0.5 in the RE and 0.7 in the LE.
The macular star persisted in the OC, although the edema and papilla were smaller and there were no areas with periflebitis.
The adjoining lock was negative.
There was ocular hypertension that was controlled with the withdrawal of topical corticosteroids and the use of topical beta-blockers.
At 3 weeks the VA was 0.8 in BE.
The macular star persisted and the papilla edema and macular area were not observed.
Serology results were received, resulting positive IgM for chlamydia being the rest negative.
At this time, the patient recognized abnormal vaginal discharge during fever the week prior to the episode, and ciprofloxacin was suspected due to oral secretion to the patient and her partner.
At 4 weeks the VA was 0.8 in the RE and 1 in the LE and the macular star persisted.
At 8 weeks the VA was 1 in BE and there were remnants of the macular star in BE.
At 16 weeks there were no macular star remnants in any eye.
IgM remained positive for chlamydia.
