A 40-year-old patient with a history of treated and cured HCV and Rendu-Osler-Weber disease.
Epistaxis was started at 10 years and at 20 years of age appearance of facial telangiectasias.
In 2007 due to bilateral left hemianopsia, headache, fever and vomiting, the patient was diagnosed with right occipital brain abscess, which was operated, with positive cultures for Peptostreptococcus spp.
Embolization of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in 2009 and 2011.
Follow-up in internal medicine outpatient clinics.
Paternal grandfather, mother and sister affected by the disease.
She came to the emergency department with tonic seizures with loss of consciousness and generalized stiffness.
Upon regaining consciousness, she is stupor and has right hemibody paresis that has partially recovered upon arrival.

Neurological examination revealed conscious and oriented brachycardic, dyslexia and dysgraphia, without motor focus.
During the examination, the patient suddenly presented tonic‚ñÅrigidity in the right lower limb with cutaneous-plantar extensor reflex.
Cranial CT showed hypodense image with perilesional edema without clear left frontal lesion.
Empirical treatment was initiated with ceftriax, Metronidazole Vancomycin, as well as acetone as secondary prophylaxis for seizures and Dexamethasone to treat cerebral edema.
She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit and later transferred to the infectious unit of the internal medicine service.
Brain MRI was performed in order to better characterize the brain lesion and report a focal lesion in the left frontal convexity of 33x32x19mm, well delimited with a hyperintense center on T2 and abundant cerebral abscess.
Assessed by the neurosurgery service, it was decided to perform a surgical intervention that is performed without incidents and after which the patient progressed favorably in the plant.
On chest CT during admission, multiple bilateral pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas were observed, and embolization was pending at discharge after the patient's postoperative period was overcome.
