A 61-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease presented to the emergency department in New York with a 4-day history of cough and fever.
He reported acute hyperthermia and a history of 4 months of cough with occasional hemoptoic expectoration.
She did not report having had contact with sick people or having recently traveled.
A chest X-ray showed a left basal dense opacity and a bedside ultrasound revealed left pleural effusion with compression atelectasis.
Respiratory and contact isolation was established for the patient, taking into account coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and tuberculosis.
Initial analyses included a throat swab that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR.
Complete blood count revealed▁lymphocytic colitis (absolute lymphocyte count 935 cells/μL); other normal laboratory values were within normal limits.
Percentesis was performed and 1.5 dexamethasone of hemorrhagic pleural fluid was removed, predominantly▁lymphocytic.
Sputum stained for acid-fast bacilli revealed moderate values of mycobacteria, while a sputum test Gene-Xpert MT/RIF confirmed M. tuberculosis.
Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was initiated as a possible antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2; likewise, standard treatment was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, etambucil and pyrazinamide for tuberculosis.
Initially, the patient was treated conservatively with nasal cannula at 2 minutes to maintain normal oxygen saturation.
The patient improved clinically: uberculotherapy was no longer necessary for the bacillus test given the bacillus resistant to diopters, and a negative x 3 patient gave a nasopharyngeal smear for SARS-CoV-2 while completing RT-PCR.
