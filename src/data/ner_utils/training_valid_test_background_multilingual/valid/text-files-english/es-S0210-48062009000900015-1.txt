A 64-year-old male patient with a history of poorly treated type 2 diabetes mellitus of 20 years of evolution, systemic arterial hypertension diagnosed 6 months ago without treatment, heart failure diagnosed 6 months earlier and diagnosed with chronic peritoneal dialysis, was treated.
She presented with a clinical picture of 2 weeks of evolution, after admission with symptoms suggestive of metabolic syndrome irradiating to the glans, where a transurethral catheter was placed for 2 weeks. She reported moderate abdominal pain in the hypogastrium.
The pain intensified until it was disabling 3 days before admission, so he went to our service.
Fever or more accompanying symptoms
On physical examination, the abdomen was unaltered, the penis showed necrosis in the glans and purulent secretion through the urethral meatus, as well as areas of necrosis in the first and second feet.
Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, leukocytes 11.100, platelets 304.000, glucose 138 mg/dl, BUN 143.8 mg/dl, creatinine 7.71 mg/dl, phosphorus 7.79 mmol/l
The patient underwent a partial first-order phalectomy, but during the transoperative period it was decided total due to lack of vascularity to the base of the penis; in addition, a perineal meatus was performed.
The pathology report was: distal ischemic necrosis of the glans and foreskin associated with microthrombosis and bacterial proliferation, resection margins with dystrophic calcification of the arterial media.
The culture result of secretion was Escherichia coli, so he received antibiotic therapy for 7 days.
He remained hospitalized for 9 days and was discharged in good general condition; he is currently under surveillance.
