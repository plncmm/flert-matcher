Immunoglobulins determination showed a decrease in their level (IgA 20, IgG 328, IgM < 5), confirming the serum electrophoresis such polyclonal decrease.
The lymphocyte populations performed showed a decrease in CD4 T cells, B19 cells and inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio.
Therefore, we are faced with a mixed immunodeficiency (humoral + cellular), a presumable cause of several episodes of urinary and respiratory infection that the patient mentioned in the directed interview.
Among the imaging tests performed, simple AP and lateral chest X-rays did not show pathological data.
Chest CT, however, revealed a heterogeneous density mass in the anterior▁mediastinum.
The study was completed with a PET CT, which showed an increase in uptake at this point, with no other findings.
The imaging diagnosis was thymoma vs lymphoma.
A guided biopsy of the mediastinal mass was performed and the anatomopathological diagnosis was thymoma.
After the Timectomy, CT and PET-CT were repeated, which showed no pathological findings.
Radiotherapy was not administered due to the low stage of the tumor (Macauka IIB).
The patient received treatment with immunoglobulins (Flebogamma 5%, 30 g), first with a weekly frequency, subsequently increasing the period between doses due to the good clinical evolution, with disappearance of the diarrhea and IgG.
