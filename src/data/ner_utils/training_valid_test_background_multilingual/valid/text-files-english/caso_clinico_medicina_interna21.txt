Internal Medicine Consultation Patient for second opinion.
A 64-year-old man came to the Department of Internal Medicine of our center for a constitutional condition with asthenia, anorexia, weight loss of up to 10 kg and diarrhea of 6 months duration.
In addition, she presented dysphagia for solids by a pharyngeal flat liquen of 2 years of evolution.
Among the patient's history, 3 hospitalizations in the last year due to severe respiratory infections with isolates of multiresistant germs in another center stood out, requiring intubation and the use of inotropic drugs on the three occasions.
She had also been diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis in the last year.
Other medical history records included a mixed cell thymoma▁resected 7 years ago, with negative subsequent follow-ups, refractory anemia (in study), sustained▁lymphopenia, chronic hypertension, and permanent atrial fibrillation.
The patient was being treated with paracetamol, repaglinide, esomeprazole, silodosin, carvedilol, candessartan, furosemide, prednisone, enoxaparin and digoxin.
In the consultation there was significant general deterioration and poor respiratory pattern.
The patient and his family described an acute episode of 4 days of evolution with fever, chills, titre and purulent sputum, so that emergency treatment was initiated for evaluation and evaluation.
Emergencies Diagnosis of respiratory failure and severe sepsis.
Initial management.
Upon arrival at the Emergency Room, the patient was seriously ill.
He maintained blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 121 bpm, and respiratory rate of 35 bpm.
Peripheral oxygen saturation was 76%.
Physical examination revealed cleft lip and hypoventilation predominantly in the left base, bilateral snoring and bi-causal crackles.
Arterial gas was extracted showing type 1 respiratory failure with a PaO2/FiO2 of 167 and mixed alkalosis (pH 7.57, pCO2 38 mmHg and HCO3 34.8 mmol/l).
Reservoir mask was used to treat peripheral venous access. Blood tests (blood and urine) were ordered and cultures (blood, urine and sputum) were collected.
Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were also performed.
Volume expansion was initiated with sodium chloride, broad spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy with Meropenem and▁steroids, and administration of stress.
We also requested HIV testing and CMV viral load for▁lymphopenia and history of recurrent infections.
Electrocardiogram showed tachycardic atrial fibrillation and chest X-ray showed an increased density focus in the middle and left retrocardiac fields, with associated pleural effusion.
Blood and urine analysis revealed elevated inflammatory parameters with CRP of 247 mg/l and procalcitonin of 1.7 ng/ml, severe renal failure RIFLE 2 with creatinine of 1.4 and lymphocytes of 280 96 mg/dl.
In addition, relative neutrophilia with left shift.
Due to the significant deterioration of the general condition associated with the risk of intubation, it was decided to transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit.
ICU: Resuscitation and management of critical ill patient and condition.
Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, central venous and peripheral arterial access were cannulated.
Endotracheal intubation was also required due to progressive respiratory deterioration.
The evolution in the first days is torpid, and the need for significant invasive ventilatory support persisted, although the patient maintained hemodynamic stability without requiring vasoactive drugs.
P.mirabilis, S.aureus meticilin sensitive, E.aerogenes and A.fumigatus were isolated in sputum and Ppneumo.mira from cultures collected in the emergency room.
The viral load of cytomegalovirus was positive with a logarithm of 4.86.
Antibiotic treatment was followed after obtaining results for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, antifungal susceptibility and antiviral therapy according to antibiograms.
Diagnostic Internal Medicine assessment and treatment adjustment (immunodeficiency).
Upon admission to the ICU, an assessment by Internal Medicine was requested to study the chronic process that had motivated attention in our center.
Patient history was reviewed and the diagnostic possibility of Good's syndrome was proposed.
Good's syndrome is a rare association of thymoma and immunodeficiency that was first described in 1956 by Dr. Robert A.
Good, during your studies of the contribution of thymus to mammalian immunity.
Their age of presentation is between 40 and 70 years.
The diagnosis of thymoma precedes the diagnosis of the syndrome between 3 months and 18 years, but the resection of the thymoma does not prevent the possible appearance of the immunodeficiency.
The most frequent clinical presentation is recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic diarrhea, associated with a significant deterioration of the general condition.
▁Cytomegalovirus and T.gondii are among the most common pathogens in the normal population.
Good's syndrome may also associate autoimmune phenomena, among which oral liquen stands out, present in 12% of cases described in the literature.
From the pathophysiological point of view, it is a hypogammaglobulinemia associated with B cell deficiency and defects of cellular immunity, whose mechanisms remain unknown at the moment.
▁Complementary examinations performed at admission showed hypogammaglobulinemia of 0.3 g/dl in the proteinogram.
Serum immunoglobulins were requested with the finding of global deficiency of them, with IgG 412 mg/dl, IgA 85 mg/dl and IgM 13 mg/dl values.
Lymphocyte subpopulations (0.18% B lymphocytes, compared to 91.93% T lymphocytes) were also studied.
Associated findings, the torpid evolution of the clinical picture and the severity of the patient, it was decided, according to the Hematology Department and the Intensive Care Unit physicians, to establish treatment with 0.5 mg/kg intravenous immunoglobulins.
The evolution in the following days was slowly favorable, with a paulatin decrease in inflammatory parameters and ventilatory support requirements.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable at all times and enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube, also improved diarrhea that presented at admission.
Extubation was performed with good tolerance and it was necessary to initially maintain non-invasive ventilation support with BiPAP and high flow nasal gaphages in the Intermediate Care Unit.
The patient was finally discharged from the ICU. The patient was admitted to the hospital after resolution of acute symptoms and treatment for immunodeficiency was initiated 8 days after admission to our center and 2 days after discharge from the ICU.
At discharge, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, afflicted and with an adequate respiratory pattern and peripheral malformations estimated by pulse oximetry >90 % with minimum oxygen supply by nasal cannula.
After discharge, the patient completed antibiotic treatment and was discharged from the hospital in her place of residence. She was discharged home in her private home soon after, without requiring additional rehabilitation therapy.
Later he has maintained periodic controls in his locality and monthly administration of intravenous gammaglobulins, as indicated after diagnosis of Good's syndrome.
During the first 6 months after discharge, she has not presented symptoms of any new infection.
Diarrheal expenses have partially improved, with weight appearing.
Dysphagia also improved.
Despite asthenia, the patient reported improvement in general condition and recovered independence for activities of daily living.
