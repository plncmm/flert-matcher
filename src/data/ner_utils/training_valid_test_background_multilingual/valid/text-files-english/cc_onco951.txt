Anamnesis A 63-year-old male patient presented with a painless lesion during fixation on anterolateral side of the penis body of one month of evolution.
She complained of pain for a couple of weeks a day, stabbing and intermittent pain that she experienced at night in the perineal and penile area.
Partially cede with acetaminophen.
It maintains a conserved voiding, without urethrorrhagia.
The patient has had HIV for 10 years.
In treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir, fewer than 20 copies were found in the last control.
As with other medical history of interest, the patient had an infection due to HCV and received curative treatment with viral response and ulcerative colitis treated with a desktop.
ONCOLÓGIC HISTORY In the follow-up program for ulcerative colitis, lower digestive endoscopy was performed in June 2015 and there was evidence of a sigmoid tumor whose pathology (AP) was compatible with adenocarcinoma of the intestine.
Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a pelvic notch in which diffuse thickening of the sigma walls was observed, with submucosal fatty changes indicating long-term colitis.
Loss of the fat plane of separation of the sigmoid is visualized, with respect to the bladder dome, associated with a single adenopathy in the mesosigma, which could be related to the neoplasia of the sigmoid.
No lymphadenopathy, other metastatic or distant lesions were observed.
In August 2015 a left hemicolectomy was performed.
The AP report of the piece reveals the presence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of 4.5 x 4 cm that develops throughout the intestinal wall up to mesothelial involvement of the surgical rim and 2 lymph node metastases, a rupture of which is more pronounced
It started in September 2015 adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX (follinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) receiving 12 cycles and ended in February 2016.
In December 2016, when the patient was asymptomatic, liver recurrence was observed for two metastatic lesions in segment VI of the right liver lobe treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
In February 2017, a control CT scan showed complete necrosis of liver lesions with the appearance of a tumor in the left pararectal space and values for the antigen carbohydrate-embryonal: 33.4 ng/ml (non-smokers)
Smokers 0-5 ng/ml.)
Biopsy confirmed recurrence.
BRAF, NRAS and KRAS native.
Pelvic recurrence is treated with radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with capecitabine. The mesorectal bed and internal ganglionic and iliac areas (50Gy) are affected.
Physical fitness Good general condition, performance status (PS) 0.
A stony, non-painful lesion is observed in the right anterolateral face of the penis body.
It extends to the glans respecting the apexification proximal level of the corpora.
Acquired a right inguinal mobile indurated nodule.
▁Complementary CT scan showed nonpelvic lesions with intravenous contrast, in which new blastic lesions appeared in the ischiopubic branches.
along with a 3.5 cm penile lesion affecting the urethra and the corpus▁cavernosum on the right side.
Diagnosis Penile metastasis of primary sigma.
Treatment A tumour committee commented on and first-line treatment with FOLFIRI (follinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotechnic hydrochloride)-cetuximab was started.
After successful administration of two cycles of FOLFIRI-cetuximab, which▁tolerates adequately, with mild symptoms of nausea and diarrhea (G1), the patient complains of significant improvement in perineal pain in the penile.
Currently, it is expected to administer the third cycle and evaluate evolution.
