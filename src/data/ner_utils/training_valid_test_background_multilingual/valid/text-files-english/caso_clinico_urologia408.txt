A 63-year-old man from Iquique, working in administrative work in a mining company, with a history of hypertension, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, treated with valsartan and metformin.
Non-smoker.
She initially presented cough, odynophagia and myalgia, which was treated as acute bronchitis with good clinical response.
Five weeks later, plasma creatinine (Cr) of 3.07 mg/dL and microscopic hematuria were investigated, so she was diagnosed with RPGN and referred for hospitalization.
She was admitted with normal vital signs, no oxygen requirements, no edema or findings on pulmonary examination.
Laboratory tests reported hemoglobin (Hb) 14 g/dL, leukocytes 7620/uL, platelets 373000/uL, cohesion 2.5 mg/dL, B/dL (L5.4AN-plasma IgG), neutrophils (KA), and anti-neutrophils), beta-antibodies (KA),
Urine examination showed 40-50 urine samples per field with 40% acanthocytes and proteinuria/creatinine ratio (CPI) 0.6 g/g.
Renal impairment with mild impairment of renal function up to maximum Cr 3.09 mg/dL, without requiring dialysis.
Chest computed tomography (CT) showed opacities with peribronchial ground glass density and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, reporting 88% macrophages, 98% compatible with alveolar hemorrhage.
The infectious study of BAL fluid was negative.
Anti-GBM antibodies were measured by ELISA in blood which were positive in 60.2 UA/mL (normal value < 12 UA/mL).
Renal biopsy was performed, which reported predominantly cellular crescent lesions with weak linear and focal reactivity for IgG1 and IgG3 (negative for IgA, IgG4 and C3) in the immunofluorescence.
The patient was treated with 11 sessions of plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone 3.0 g, and then high therapy with cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone, achieving negative anti-GBM antibodies to Cr, with good clinical response.
Subsequently, the patient was kept under monthly clinical control, where adequate clinical evolution was observed, progressively decreasing corticoids and improving renal function with Cr up to 1.5 mg/dL, Hb 12.3 g/dL and maintaining cyclophosphamide antibodies negative at term.
Two weeks after completing cyclophosphamide treatment for 3 months, with prednisone and prophylaxis for cystic paralysis jiroveci, the patient developed a one-week history of myalgia, fever, hemoptoic cough and progressive dyspnea.
The following tests were ordered: Hb 11 g/dL, leukocytes 12.720/uL, platelets 366.000/uL, Cr 2.27 mg/dL, Na 142 mEq/L and bilateral multifocal alveolar K 4.4 mEq/L, fill.
She was hospitalized and treated for multilobar pneumonia with ceftazidime 1g c/12 h and vancomycin 1 g c/72 h. However, in 48 h she developed acute respiratory failure with ventilatory failure, increased respiratory rate
Cotrimoxazole was added and fixed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an ambulance air to our hospital due to suspected recurrence.
He was admitted with severe hypoxemia with PaFI < 200, highlighting in his tests: lactate 0.8 mmol/L, Hb 7.7 g/dL, Cr▁2.9 mg/dL, BUN 32 mg/dL calcium, normal plasma electrolytes 2.8 mg/dL.
Bronchial consolidation with bronchoalveolar lavage BAL was performed, which showed blood in the airways of 40% macrophages, with a negative microbiological study.
Anti-GBM antibodies were requested prior to plasmapheresis by ELISA techniques in blood and by multiple-flow immune response, resulting negative.
The same sample was negative for immunization in the Mayo Clinic.
Due to the suspicion of recurrence of EAMBG, it was decided to empirically treat with 9 sessions of plasmapheresis, methylprednisolone 3 g, 2 doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (800 mg) associated with renal failure
Subsequently, oral therapy with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/day and prednisone at high doses was continued.
During hospitalization, anti-GBM antibodies were repeatedly measured by ELISA, always resulting negative.
In addition, ANA, ANCA, antimyeloperoxidase antibodies and anti proteinase 3 were requested by ELISA and anti-scl70, all of which were negative.
The patient responded favorably to the therapy, without new episodes of hemoptysis, achieving extubation and discontinuation of hemodialysis, prior to progressive improvement of renal function until Cr 2.0 mg/dL.
Currently, 9 months later, the patient remains in good general condition, being treated with prednisone and azathioprine.
Latest tests (August 2018): Cr 1.58 mg/dL, urine test with IPC 283 mg/g, 2-4 erythrocytes/field with 2% acanthocytes < 3.0mL, and anti-AU antibodies
