A 34-year-old male of Spanish nationality consulted due to an increase in the abdominal▁perimeter of about 10 days of evolution accompanied by a feeling of gastric plenity and precocious satiety.
He did not report fever, constitutional symptoms or other symptoms of interest.
He was a smoker of 15 years/pack and was a drinker of less than 20 g/day.
I worked on construction.
On physical examination, the patient presented good general condition, cutaneous dryness, blood pressure 110/60, temperature 36o, heart rate 76lpm and saturation 02 98%.
No lymphadenopathy was detected in peripheral ganglion chains.
Cardiopulmonary arrest normal.
Abdomen: she had moderate ascites semiology without pain, without other findings of interest.
Lower limbs without edema.
▁Complementary tests performed in the emergency room: erythrocytes 2,900,000, Hb 8.8g/dl, hematocrit 25%, MCV 86.6.2fL, Platelets 181,000mills/uL, Leukocytes 35500
Coagulation: TP 17.6s, IQ 65.9%, INR 1.44, TTPA 27.2 Normal basic biochemistry.
GOT 44, GPT 72.
Chest X-ray: normal.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed in the presence of new onset ascites, which confirmed the presence of abundant free fluid in perihepatic, perisplenic space, both gutta and minor pelvis.
Liver without evidence of focal lesions.
Alithiasic bladder.
Patent door.
Discreta is a homogeneous anomaly of 14.5cm.
Extra diagnostic paracentesis was performed extra fluid and clear liquid with the following findings: Haematuria 140, Leukocytes 210 (PMN40%, MN60%), glucose 103, proteins 0.8, ADA 5.4, albumin 7.
The culture was negative and the cytological study showed reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.
▁Complementary tests with complete blood analysis were performed in the hospital ward: total cholesterol 89mg/dl, HDLc 23mg/dl.
Total proteins in plasma 5.8mg/dl, albumin 3.4g/dl, Ca 7.7mg/dl, CRP 1.14mg/dl.
Thyroid hormones were normal.
The iron profile showed iron 25, transferrin 247, IST 8, ferritin 38.
Peripheral blood smears confirmed▁lymphopenia absolute and anaphylaxis.
Normal platelet series.
Folate and vitamin B12 were normal.
A gastrointestinal study with Gastroenterology, Colonoscopy and Transit gastrointestinal without findings.
Because this was a newly diagnosed ascites of unknown etiology, we calculated the Albumin serum and Albumin ascitic fluid gradient, which was therefore indicative of 2.8, PTHP.
The most common cause of ascites in the context of portal hypertension is chronic cirrhotic liver disease due to any etiology.
In this sense, the study was extended with serology HBV and HCV, Anti-mitochondral (AMA), Anti-smooth muscle (SMA), Anti-protein MK, copper metabolism, alpha-fetoprotein markers
CA 125 of 176 (0.5-35).
The ANA + titer 1/160 pattern with Anti-DNA negative.
RCT: 86 (8-55).
The serology of HIV, Rose Bengala, Fever Q and Leishmania were negative.
Mantoux negative.
Echocardiogram: Normal study without signs of right or suprahepatic pathology.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan showed abundant ascites in all peritoneal spaces with adenopathies in the mesentery and upper retroperitoneum up to 1.5cm.
Discreta is a rare anomaly.
The study was extended with abdominal MRI: normal liver, without pathological uptakes.
Thrombosis of the main portal vein with cavernomatosis is homogeneous.
Intra-abdominal free fluid
Multiple retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies and mesentery.
The presence of a portal vein thrombosis of unexplained cause is made a hypercoagulable study that shows no alterations of interest.
Also, to rule out paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, we determined hemoinuria, haptoglobin, leukocytes and HAM test that were normal or negative.
In summary, this is the case of a 34-year-old male with acute onset ascites and albumin gradient suggestive of portal hypertension, associated with homogeneous adenopathy and chronic retroperitoneal disease.
An exploratory laparotomy with biopsy of the adenopathies at the mesenteric and retroperitoneal level is proposed.
Pathological examination showed lymph nodes with preserved architecture, presence of epithelioid focal granulomas with multinucleated giant cells without necrosis.
No microorganisms were detected using PAS and Zielh techniques.
We present a patient with portal vein thrombosis with portal hypertension and granulomatous lymphadenitis.
Clinical entities that course with granulomatous peritoneal lymphadenitis are: granulomatous infectious diseases (TBC, other mycobacterial diseases, CF, Leprosy, Brucellosis, Thyphoid fever, Neoplastic process, W
Due to the pathological findings of the adenopathies (epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells without necrosis), the presence of elevated ACE and negativity of the rest of the study performed portal hypertension is pointed out as first possibility.
Treatment with▁steroids and oral anticoagulation was initiated with good clinical response, with gradual disappearance of ascites and reduction of the size of the lymph nodes.
Steroid treatment was progressively discontinued in about 9 months and anticoagulation was maintained.
The patient had a clinically stable bleeding but at 4 years the ascites appeared and the signs of portal hypertension with ascites, esophageal varices grade II-III/IV and several episodes became more evident.
Anticoagulation was discontinued and treatment with beta-blockers was initiated as prophylaxis of rebleeding.
Imaging tests revealed a global hepatomegaly with lobulated contours and a very heterogeneous echostructure in relation to chronic liver disease, with abundant ascites and adenomegaly.
Liver function analysis is classified as Child Pugh B9 and MELD 10.
Due to the appearance of new episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and frequent episodes of ascites thrombosis requiring weekly gastrointestinal bleeding, the possibility of placement of TIPS is assessed, which is rejected due to the technical difficulties involved.
Finally, with the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis with liver cirrhosis and Hypertensive portal hypertension, the patient is included in the liver transplant list, and an orthotopic liver transplant with temporary portocaval shunt is performed.
The anatomopathological study of the patient's liver showed liver tissue with loss of architecture, supported by nodules separated by fibrous septa of the centrolobular zone with non-necrotizing▁sarcoid granulomas.
At present, the patient is well under treatment with Tacrólimus and Micophenolate, as well as▁steroids.
Final diagnosis Liver and lymph node sarcoma with portal thrombosis associated with cirrhosis with refractory portal hypertension requiring orthotopic liver transplantation.
