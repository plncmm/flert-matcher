A 59-year-old Wuhan woman was admitted to our hospital after 4 days of recurrent fever.
Her maximum temperature was 38.8 °C before admission, accompanied by headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting; she reported no chills, cough or muscle pain.
She had relapsed in Wuhan for many years and had a history of contact with a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The patient also had a history of chronic gastritis.
Prior to admission, the laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Control confirmed by RT-PCR that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Initial laboratory tests also showed a low white blood cell formula (3.06 × 109/L; normal range: 3.50-9.50 × 109/L) and▁lymphocytic formula (0.20 × 109/L; normal range: 1.10-3).
A chest CT scan showed bilateral ground glass opacities, which were considered indicative of viral pneumonia.
Based on the history and tests, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.
After admission, the patient developed recurrent fever, up to 38.6 °C, which progressed with chills, cough with little white sputum, nasal congestion, chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea.
Analytical tests showed that C-reactive protein levels gradually increased, while leukocyte formula and lymphocyte count decreased.
Initially, the patient was given antiviral and anti-infective treatment.
Six days after admission, the patient showed a marked dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, and saturation was 169 (< 300).
A chest CT scan showed multiple ground glass opacities and bilateral patchy, with impermissible limits and basically subpleural distribution.
The nucleic acid tests of the SARS-CoV-2 were negative and the CAT showed diffuse consolidations in both lungs.
No pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was observed.
Pulmonary lesions showed a clear worsening and increased size.
The diagnosis was changed to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient was transferred to the ICU.
Treatment was immediately switched to high frequency ventilation and administration of human immunoglobulin and teicoplanin.
After 9-11 days, the patient's temperature returned to normal values but cough and hemoptoic expectoration worsened.
However, C-reactive protein values decreased, while leukocyte formula and lymphocyte count gradually increased; furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 test was negative.
The CT scan showed an enlarged lesion with greater attenuation.
Some ground glass opacities had evolved to consolidations.
The patient's symptoms improved, but the diagnostic imaging tests showed worsening.
The physician treating the condition delayed the presentation of changes in imaging tests.
With a set of effective treatments on days 12, 17 and 21 after admission, detection of SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid tests of pharyngeal smears was negative.
Chest CT scans showed clear absorption of lesions and a subpleural line.
The patient's symptoms improved and nucleic acid tests continued to be negative for SARS-CoV-2, so that she left the quarantine and was discharged.
In this case, in the thoracic CT scans we observed dynamic changes in severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
In the early phase of the disease, CT showed multiple ground or patchy glass opacities with subpleural distribution in several bilateral lobes, characteristic of the signs of COVID-19 pneumonia in a CT scan.
As the pneumonia progressed, the CT scan showed that, in a few days, the areas of the lesions in the lungs increased in size and went on to diffuse consolidations in both lungs.
Even when the nucleic acid tests of the SARS-CoV-2 yielded negative results and the patient's symptoms were poor, there was a delay in the changes in the CT scans and in the evidence of absorption of the lesions.
During the absorption period, patched pulmonary consolidations decreased and gradually absorbed, but the subpleural line was still present.
Dynamic chest CT plays a very important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
