A 64-year-old patient presented to the emergency room with epigastric incisional hernia two months ago. At present, the patient developed redness and purulent secretion in the area.
There is no fever, abdominal pain, or other accompanying symptoms.
The patient was operated one year after laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a medical history of interest.
A CT scan of the left non-pelvic cavity revealed a 7 x 3.7 cm collection in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the epigastric region, which showed an irregular intra-oral gas.
No intraabdominal fungal infection at the time
Attention is paid to the presence of three heterogeneous lesions, in close relationship with liver surface, greater than 3.8 cms (median tail, anterior to IVC), nonspecific.
‚ñÅComplementary MRI could be performed to better define its nature.
Adjacent to the larger lesion there are small lymph nodes.
MRI findings were similar to those of CT, with marked restriction of diffusion, so FNA was performed by endoscopic ultrasound of the portocaval space lesion, with findings compatible with acute infectious inflammation.
These findings were confirmed by a CT scan of reassessment, which suggested the diagnosis of lithogenic abscesses cholecystectomy, because the internal features suggestive of content also presented hyperdense lithiasic images.
