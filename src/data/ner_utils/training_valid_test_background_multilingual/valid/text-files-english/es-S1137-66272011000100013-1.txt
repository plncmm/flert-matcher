A 45-year-old man, a female quarry worker for 23 years, diagnosed with complicated silicosis (PMF).
He had been a 10-year-old former smoker of 15 packs/year and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 2000, who had been treated correctly with relapse in 2003.
He had required frequent courses of▁steroids in the last two years.
She came to the emergency department due to dyspnea and hemoptoic expectoration of 5 months of evolution.
Physical examination revealed a low-grade fever (37.3oC).
Pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral snoring and wheezing.
Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin 11.9 g/l; platelets: 515,000 / mm3; sedimentation rate 79 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 50 mg/l.
Arterial gas showed respiratory failure (pH 7.45, arterial oxygen pressure 59 mm Hg, and atrial fibrillation pressure 35 mm Hg).
A bilateral micronodular pattern with clusters in both upper lobes was observed on chest X-ray.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed extensive bilateral interstitial involvement in relation to complicated silicosis with formation of large masses of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), which had cavitation within their right lobe not present in a CT scan of 9 months.
Fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy showed no significant findings and the smear of the bronchoaspirate showed no malignancy.
In sputum, the lowestein culture was negative and culture positive for Aspergillus fumigatus.
A CT scan showed that the cavitated lesion had decreased in size after 7 months of voriconazole treatment.
The patient is currently undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation.
