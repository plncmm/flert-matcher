A 64-year-old man presented with syncope without relevant background.
His vitals were within normal intervals.
Ear temperature was 38Â°C and oxygen saturation was 99% in room air.
The chest X-ray revealed mild linear densities in the middle and lower left lung fields.
Analytical tests showed an increase in leukocyte count (10.900 per ?L), high serum lactate concentration (250 (U/L) and high values of C-reactive protein (89 mg/dL).
The rest of the tests gave normal results.
COVID-19 was detected in a sample of pharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR.
Due to worsening of laboratory tests on day 2 (white blood cell count 15.270 per ?L; serum lactate 341 U/L, serum C-reactive protein 285 mg/dL), a specialized patient was admitted to the hospital.
On day 6, the patient had dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation and an additional increase in C-reactive protein (336 mg/dL); white blood cell count was 10.800 ng/L and interleukin-6 was 80 ng/dL.
On day 7, a non-contrast-enhanced chest CT scan showed bilateral alveolar opacities, including ground glass opacities and consolidation, with a later prevalent distribution, linear opacities, mainly peripheral, pleural effusion.
Assisted ventilation was initiated.
The patient received two doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg), at 12-hour intervals, on days 7 and 8.
On day 9, C-reactive protein decreased to 96 mg/dL and leukocyte count to 2,360 per ?L.
The clinical status of the patient improved progressively and assisted respiration was gradually withdrawn.
On day 14, new chest CT scans revealed a clear improvement in peripheral pleural effusion, with a reduction in alveolar opacities, a reduction in the density of consolidations, and evidence of some ground-glass opacities,
