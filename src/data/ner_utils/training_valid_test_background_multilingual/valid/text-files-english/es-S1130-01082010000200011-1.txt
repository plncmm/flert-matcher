A 71-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension, kidney transplants without associated colitis, was admitted to the emergency department because she presented with fever for 24 hours, abdominal pain more intense left iliac fossa liquid diarrhea, and vomiting.
On physical examination, the patient presented with a low-grade fever, was hemodynamically stable, well hydrated, eupneic and normocolored.
The abdomen was blushing and depressible, with pain to deep palpation, without clear focalization and without signs of peritoneal irritation.
As complementary tests were performed an analytical showing discrete leukocytosis (10,200/μl) with a CRP of 2 mg/dl, neutrophilia, and a simple abdominal radiography that was normal.
The diagnostic suspicion of acute inflammatory diverticula was established by abdominal computed tomography, which revealed a diverticulum in the small intestine, with a diverticulum in the first morphology and a 16 mm internal bone with signs suggestive of an "y",
A millimetric pneumoperitoneum bubble and inflammation of the adjacent fat were also observed adjacent to the diverticulum. These findings were compatible with acute diverticulum diverticulum with a foreign body.
With these results and in view of the acceptable general condition of the patient, she was admitted to the hospital for treatment with digestive rest, broad spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy (Imipenem 500 mg every 6 hours) and observation.
During the stay the patient improves the fever but the abdominal pain persists, so it was decided to perform a scheduled surgery.
During the intervention, multiple diverticula were evident at the level of the Andean, one of them with inflammatory signs, but without intra-abdominal abscesses.
The gallbladder is distended and the common bile duct has a diameter greater than 1 cm.
Intestinal resection was performed with reconstruction by laterolateral anastomosis, cholecystectomy and biliary tract exploration after confirmation of choledocholithiasis by cholangiography, extracting the▁calculus and leaving a Kehrco drain of 4 mm in bile duct
The immediate postoperative period was uneventful, reintroducing the diet with good tolerance and digestive tract.
A trans-Kehr cholangiography was performed, which showed absence of▁coccidioidomycosis.
On the tenth day after surgery, the patient developed sudden abdominal pain associated with hypotension and elevation of pancreatic enzymes. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of moderate acute pancreatitis and died 24 hours later due to multiple organ failure.
