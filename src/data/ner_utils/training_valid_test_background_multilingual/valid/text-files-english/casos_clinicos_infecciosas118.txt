A 47-year-old woman, a professor, resident in our country, presented with macular, circular, erythematous skin lesions, some edematous and increased local temperature in the extremities.
The patient had been travelling for three weeks to Pennsylvania, a northeastern state of U.S.A., with large outdoor extensions of forests.
Two days after his return to Santiago, he presented mandibular pain, headache and severe neck pain, which was treated with oral ibuprofen for one week and then with cyclobenzaprine.
On the sixth day, the patient presented the first cutaneous macula in the right arm, to which others were progressively added.
A week later, a non-quantified feverish sensation, general▁malaise, insomnia and pain in both wrists and knees were added.
▁Dermatological physical examination revealed multiple erythematous macules target-type or target-type, of large size (up to 20 cm in diameter larger), in different stages of evolution.
The largest lesion was located in the posterior aspect of the left thigh, with increased local temperature, edema and a burning sensation to the touch, compatible with multiple erythema migrans.

Lessons in the trunk
Given the clinical picture and epidemiological history, a Lyme disease was diagnosed in early disseminated stage.
Treatment was initiated with topical salicylic acid 100 mg administered orally every 12 h for 21 days, cetirizine 10 mg administered orally daily, and topical hydrolysis 1% twice daily.
IgM and IgG serology was requested for Borrelia burgdorferi, which was performed at the UC Christus Clinical Laboratory of Health Network.
As screening, five enzimoimmune antibodies were detected in fluorescent dye or VidasR 13 and were confirmed by western blot (MarDxR) with three more bands for IgG5 positive.
At the end of the treatment, the skin lesions improved, maintaining a mild violet erythema in both thighs and general symptoms, although mild pain persisted in the forearms and fingers and paresthesias in the legs.

The directed neurological and cardiological evaluation ruled out systemic compromise due to Lyme disease.
