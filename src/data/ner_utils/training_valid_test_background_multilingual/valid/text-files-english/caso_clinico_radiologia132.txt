Platelet count was normal, but CK level was elevated.
Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the skull showed scattered calcifications of the cortico-extraaxial location, which were not present in the previous CT six months before, and were initially interpreted as a finding without transcendence.
A more detailed analysis showed the presence of vasogenic edema associated with a dominant tentorial calcification, so a contrast-enhanced CT scan showed discrete nodular enhancement associated with the calcifications.
Diagnostic possibilities were established as: meningeal carcinomatosis and neurocysticercosis (calcifications at 8 months of differential diagnosis and edema in neurocysticercosis can help).
The CSF cytology diagnosed adenocarcinoma.
Body CT detected a small bowel tumor and lung metastases.
