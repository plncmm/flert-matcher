PRESENT ANESTH OF PERFORMERS AND▁CLINICAL HISTORY PRESENTATION A 49-year-old male patient with no relevant medical or surgical history, except for chronic active alcoholism.
Field worker.
He came to the emergency department of our hospital derived from Motril for psychiatric evaluation.
Two weeks before she suffered an accidental fall with traumatic brain injury and uncomplicated linear occipital fracture.
Subsequently, she abandoned her alcohol intake, and days later she made a suicide attempt and began aggressively with her family members, agitation, insomnia and visual and auditory disorders.
Normal Constant psychec EXPLORATION.
Good general condition, conscious, alert, disoriented in space and time.
Force and sensitivity were preserved and symmetrical in both hemibodies.
Location: symmetrical bilateral +++/++.
Not evaluable march.
Normal cranial nerves.
Dysmetry of the upper limbs.
No meningeal signs.
Less dermal desquamatives in hands and face, symmetrical, nonspecific.
Rest of the exploration without alterations of interest INITIAL EVOLUTION The patient enters Internal Medicine after evaluation by Psychiatry.
Treatment was initiated with▁benzodiazepines, thiamine and pyridoxine.
After several weeks of treatment there is no improvement, and neurological disorders persist among the following: confusion, disorientation, agitation, marked auditory and visual disturbances, extrapyramidal▁rigidity very fluctuating, inintelligence language.
In addition, it has different complications, among which we highlight: - Diarrhea, without pathological products.
Persistence despite antidiarrheal treatment and empirical antibiotic treatment.
The patient improved with the start of parenteral nutrition - fever, with no apparent focus.
A central venous catheter placed for parenteral nutrition was removed and S. epidermis was isolated in both hemocultives and catheter culture.
Antibiotic treatment was not required - Le dermal ̄s admittance, present since the self-limiting of POSTAGE ADLEMENTARY PRUEBAS * Analytically highlights a slight elevation of CK and normal acid macrocytic anemia.
Analytical parameters characteristic of malnutrition.
* TAC skull: Left frontal hypodensity in relation to infarction or old trauma.
Cerebral cortex.
▁Linear image suggestive of left occipital fracture not displaced.
NMR: Small hyperintense lesions in white matter of nonspecific appearance although suggesting vascular origin.
Focal cortical▁atrophy suggests an increased number of anterior cruciate ligaments and lateral ventricles suggestive of leukocytes * mm/LCR: proteins 1mg/dl, glucose 54mg/dl, dementia
Culture and negative staining* Coprocultive, C.difficile toxin, serology hepatitis B and C, LUES, and CMV viral load: normal * Echocardiogram, ECG, Rx.
Abdominal ultrasound: data of chronic liver disease.
* Colonoscopy: colitis with ulcers that suggests an ischemic process as the first possibility.
Colon biopsy: glandular regenerative changes and acute focal inflammation (microabscesses) that could be secondary to a previous infectious process DIAGNOSTIC DIFERENTIAL alcoholic patient must be considered in the differential diagnosis.
At first, a delirium tremens withdrawal syndrome was thought; however, the absence of signs of autonomic hyperactivity and lack of improvement despite treatment with▁benzodiazepines, support measures, tiapride and lack of improvement were agreed upon.
For the same reason it was ruled out that it was an alcoholic acidosis.
Another possible diagnosis could have been a vitamin B1 deficiency (thiamine) that was producing a Wernic-Filke-Korsakoff syndrome; however, the typical clinical findings of memory were not found first, such as memory.
Additionally, no pathognomonic images of Wernicke were found on cranial MRI.
Other tests that did not detect diarrhea could also explain the lack of improvement, such as pellagra due to VitB3 deficiency (niacin) FINAL DEVELOPMENT: Lack of improvement despite the time of neurological evolution with marked fluctuations.
DIAGNOSIS In our case, the cutaneous diagnosis was made because it did not present very florid manifestations, but it passed almost inadvertent and could be included in this section.
It should be noted that the classic triad is rare.
Currently, there is no laboratory test or data for diagnosis, although there are data to support it, it is based exclusively on the clinic.
This disease should be considered especially in malnourished patients: alcoholics initially (important response factor in our environment), transgress dietetics very early and 100 mg later intestinal malaortion, HIV... treatment is based on the administration of
Pellagra, although rare nowadays, continues to occur in our environment.
Our patient responded my favorably and quickly to the administration of niacinamide.
The patient was reviewed several months later in the consultation, having abandoned alcohol consumption and being completely asymptomatic.
