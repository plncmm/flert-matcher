A 46-year-old woman diagnosed with ulcerative colitis for 12 years was followed up at the gastroenterology clinic.
From the gastrointestinal point of view, it has presented outbreaks of its disease almost annual, requiring admission for control on two occasions.
For two years now, the patient has been under control with a 3 mg seal every 24 hours, a 4 mg sealant, and 50 mg azathioprine every 12 hours.
It has presented poor clinical tolerance when trying to reduce the dose of azathioprine, with an increase in the number of stools.
Under these circumstances, she takes beclomethasone and prednisone.
No other personal history of interest was reported.
Active life without toxic habits.
The patient is previously asymptomatic and starts with a picture, abricated and insidious, of month and a half of evolution consisting of neck pain, torticollis and progressive headache.
For this reason, she came to the emergency department several times, where after evaluation she was discharged with analgesic treatment, suspecting cervical contracture.
Subsequently, the patient presented progressive clinical worsening with increased pain intensity, general▁malaise, fever and sore throat, so she went back to the hospital.
On this occasion, the patient has a regular general condition, despite the maintained constants: temperature 37.5oC, blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 75 bpm.
The patient presented edematous and bulging faces, neck pain upon cervical mobilization and palpation, no fluctuating masses, no adenopathy, no erythema on the skin.
No cervical crepitation, supraclavicular notch.
In the oral cavity, there were intravelic tonsils without plaques, non uvula, and no abobulated pharynx.
The rest of the cardiorespiratory and abdominal examinations did not present any data of interest.
Analytically, there is an increase in acute phase reactants with CRP 230 mg/L; neutrophilia without leukocytosis, platelets 496000, INR 1.19, fibrinogen 850 mg/dL, rest without findings of interest.
An urgent CT scan showed a retropharyngeal thickening at the nasopharynx and oropharynx, as well as an increase in blunt tissue in front of the body C2 and posterior arch of C1 without epidural component.
It detects erosion of the anterior-superior angle of the C3 body and anterior cortical of the atlas.
The findings suggest retropharyngeal abscess and high cervical periaquism.
The imaging test and the clinical impact of the patient were performed. The patient was admitted to the ENT department for drainage.
Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
Differential diagnosis Deep cervical infections (DCI) have reduced their incidence due to the development of antibiotic therapy; however, they are potentially lethal conditions and susceptible to serious complications.
They are developed in virtual spaces limited by aponeurosis that are not very resistant to the infection among them (cervical spine MR (T2 sequence): abscess pre-dissemination and peidural collection (C2-C3)).
Pericardial, masetherine, mucomaxillary, retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, submandibular,▁parotid and floor of the mouth abscesses are distinguished.
The most common etiologic agent of these infections are bacteria, which come from septic foci of the oral cavity, such as teeth,▁parotid gland, cervical lymph nodes, middle ear or sinusoids1.
The main bacteria are viridans group streptococci 2-5 followed by oral abiotics such as Peptococci, Futella spp isolated and Actnaeroomyces Prevovo
Other less frequent causes would be infection by Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterobacteria producing beta extended spectrum Staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis or fungal infections.
In these cases, it is mandatory to search for some type of immunosuppression, such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, charity or HIV.
The correct anatomical location of the abscess by imaging tests is essential, since the most frequent etiology varies depending on it.
The most frequent cause of infection in the predetermined space is gram-positive microorganisms, mainly S. aureus that can cause spondylodylodyscitis due to dissemination.
Streptococci are the second most common cause in surgical patients.
Less common gram-negative bacilli are Gram-negative bacilli, among which E.coli is the most prevalent, although cases of Pseudomonas spp and fungal infections have also been described, which are very rare entities.
Isolated cases of Aspergillus spp, Candida spp, Coccidioides spp and Blastomyces spp. have been reported.
The possibility of a tuberculous abscess, which may present with bone involvement (tuberculous spondylodyscitis or Pott's disease) should also be considered. Most common infections come from the oral cavity, such as regional cysts or upper tract traumas. The most common causes include infections.
Another possibility is that they originate from contiguity of vertebral infections (dyscitis or osteomyelitis).
The alarm symptoms are: dyspnea, stridor, increased cervical volume, tenderness on the floor of the mouth, sialorrhea and pharyngeal wall bulging.
The complications of these infections can range from infectious or regional sepsis to severe sepsis, due to infectious or septic dissemination, or due to necrotising abscesses caused by necrotising osteomyelitis, fascia.
In some cases, inflammation may favor the formation of thrombi in the vessels, causing thromboflebitis.
Lemierre's syndrome is the most severe manifestation of the condition, which consists of septic thromboflebitis of the internal jugular vein and metastatic infections.
The diagnosis of PCI is essentially clinical.
Imaging studies, especially CT, will help, delimiting the extent of the process and detecting the presence of recognizable areas.
Plain radiography can identify the odontogenic origin of the infection, the extension to the▁thorax, or can demonstrate an increase of soft tissues at the pre-existing level in the pharyngeal area.
Cervical ultrasound allows the visualization of soft tissues, being a closed test, which provides information on the location, size, relationship with▁neighboring structures and content of the lesion.
MRI (T2-sequence) showed resolution of spondylodyscitis at the end of treatment.
However, the gold standard for this type of deep infection remains contrast-enhanced CT.
Medical-surgical treatment should be established early, taking into account the location of the PCI and the commitments it produces.
Cultures can be obtained with the incision, which offer greater microbiological precision than hemocultives, and the affected tissue can be debrided, being the most effective treatment.
During admission, various imaging tests (CT without and with contrast and MRI) were performed, with initial discrepancy regarding the location, with retropharyngeal versus microbiological localization being proposed, with the etiological implications.
Finally, it was concluded as predict.
The evolution of the patient was torpid, with a prolonged hospitalization of almost one month in ENT.
At admission, surgical drainage of the abscess was performed. Subsequent controls showed progressive growth of the abscess, extending from the foramen magnum to the space C4-C5, with a probable osteogenic disruption of the posterior body in 7.8cm.
Given the findings it was necessary to re-operate the patient twice more.
Cultivation of cervical▁exudate obtained after surgical drainage isolated Candida albicans susceptible to azoles.
After starting treatment with fluconazole 400mg/12h, the patient presented good clinical and radiological response, with only mild discomfort persisting.
After six months of fluconazole treatment every 12 hours and a descending prednisone regimen, complete resolution of spondylodyscitis has been achieved.
Currently under follow-up in outpatient infectious diseases.
Final diagnosis Abscesses due to Candida albicans secondary to infectious cervical spondylodiscitis probably occurred in immunocompromised patients.
