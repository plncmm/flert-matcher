A 65-year-old patient with a history of type 2 DM and dyslipidemia with fever for one week, was treated with antipyretics due to a viral condition.
The patient had a poor outcome and was admitted to the emergency department.
On physical examination, the patient was brachypsychic and tachypneic, with blood pressure of 140/70 and temperature of 40o.
The rest of the scan is anodyne.
Analyses showed complete blood count without leukocytosis with neutrophilia and hemoglobin of 10 g/dl, LDH (486), GOT (92) GPT (60) Alkaline‚ñÅPhosphatase (610), GGT (54), VSG.
The remaining parameters and tumor markers were unchanged.
Chest and abdominal X-rays are normal.
In search of a probable abdominal focus, an abdominal ultrasound was requested, in which multiple echogenic images with descending ring artifact suggestive of gas were observed in the left hepatic lobe.
Abdominal CT was performed to confirm the diagnosis and showed a large collection of 9x10 cm in the left liver lobe with multiple gas bubbles.
Intravenous treatment with Tazocel and Metonidazole was started with drainage by echocardiographic control to extract purulent material.
Streptococcus viridans and Enterococus faecalis were isolated in hemocultives.
Given the radiological increase of the abscess, it was decided to perform a surgical intervention by laparotomy, locating in the duodenal frame a chicken bone attacking the pylorus.
