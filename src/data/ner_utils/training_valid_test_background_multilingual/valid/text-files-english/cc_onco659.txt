Anamnesis A 54-year-old male with a history of mental retardation with 55 % of disability and idiopathic generalised epilepsy in follow-up by Neurology and home treatment with carbamazepine.
The family history of cancer included: brother who died of lung cancer, another brother being treated for lung cancer and a deceased father of laryngeal cancer.
In October, the patient comes to the emergency department due to constitutional syndrome accompanied by abdominal pain along with numerous diarrheal episodes of two weeks of evolution.
An ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed multiple liver lesions, suggestive of metastases settled in a liver with enlargement and chest X-ray, finding a rounded lower mass and well-defined right lung lobe.
Analytically, slightly increased liver enzymes, hemoglobin (hb) of 11.9 g/dl are observed.
Given the data obtained, it was decided to enter the Digestive Service for study.
During his stay in the Digestive Unit, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen was performed, reporting findings compatible with neoplasia of the right lower lobe of the lung of about 6.5 cm in diameter, liver metastases and adenopathies at celiac trunk level.
A liver core needle biopsy (GNB) was requested.
Given the persistence and frequency of stools, a detailed study of possible causes that give rise to negative results for malabsorption/digestion toxin, celiac disease, and Clostridium difficile is performed.
Then, the patient receives care, with limitations due to poor preparation, without gross alterations being observed.
In a stable situation and pending liver BAG results, the patient is discharged.
In December, the patient comes back to the Emergency Department for moderate rectal bleeding, where rectal examination is performed without evidence of spontaneous bleeding except thrombosed hemorrhoids and in emergency laboratory tests gdl need transfusion.
The patient was admitted to the institution where the patient was diagnosed with SAP, with histopathological diagnosis of liver metastases of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a proliferative index (Ki 67) of 2 % and CK1 / TT19 negative for CK-AE.
Dual: CD56, CEA.
Octreoscan® test was performed, which showed pathological tracer uptake in the liver and lung parenchyma, as well as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was requested in the urine of 24 hours after AT.
The patient begins with very florid symptoms; severe chest pain without irradiation, discarding an ischemic cause; besides edema of the thoracic slave, performing a superior vena cavat syndrome, and echocardiography jugular insufficiency, which is the reason for this.
The case is discussed in Cardiology, and the patient is not a subsidiary of surgical treatment.
Due to the high suspicion of this syndrome (although 5-HIAA is pending), and difficult symptom control, especially diarrhea and chest pain in patients with seizures or signs of chronic renal failure, we discuss the case with a conservative treatment.
After stability and good pain control, the patient is discharged and is referred to the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinics together with on-call follow-up.
Pharmacovigilance Plan
Terrous skin color
Oriented, though mental retardation.
Eupneic at rest.
Baseline saturation at 98 %.
HR 80 bpm.
Heart attack with pure tones with audible murmur, some extrasystole.
Pulmonary vesicular lesions: preserved mucus without rales with generalized hypoventilation.
The abdomen was blando, depresible, painful during the deep fixation in the hypogastrium, and the left iliac fossa showed a non-painful hard hepatomegaly with two layers.
No edemas in the lower limbs.
▁Complementary tests » CT of the chest and abdomen, which reports findings compatible with neoplasia of the right lower lobe of the lung of about 6.5 cm in diameter, liver metastases and adenopathies at the celiac trunk level.
» Hepatic BAG of metastases from well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a proliferative index (Ki 67) of 2 % and the following▁immunohistochemical profile: positive for CKAE1/CKap19,▁chromofigranin and non-
Dual: CD56, CEA.
5-FUOA in urine positive (26.50 mg/24h).
» Chest-abdomen reassessment CT, which reports progression in number and size of lymph node metastases. Consequently, a first-line chemotherapy treatment with adenopathy is started, showing good tolerance and clinical benefit.
Diagnosis Seizure associated with neuroendocrine tumor of probable intestinal origin with liver, lung and abdominal lymph node involvement.
Treatment A first-line chemotherapy regimen consisting of an ever-presented 10 mg daily is initiated continuously until reassessment is made.
Transcurrence of central thoracic pain one month after discharge from the hospital, often comes to the emergency department with characteristics similar to those of the previous admission, requiring treatment with opioids.
To improve the clinical status, the Endocrinology Department is consulted. After receiving the result of 5-HIAA in positive urine (26.50 mg/24 h), it decides to increase the dose of octreotide 21 days to 40 mg.
At the beginning of February, on an outpatient basis, an on-call chest CT scan was requested. The patient reported ever progressing in number and lymph node diseases, chemotherapy with good clinical toxicity and lack of therapeutic benefit.
