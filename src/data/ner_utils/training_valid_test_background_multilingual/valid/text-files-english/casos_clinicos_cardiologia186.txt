A 21-year-old girl with no personal history of interest or usual treatment is reported.
End-term pregnancy with vaginal delivery in a private clinic 48 hours before being brought to the emergency department.
Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful.
However, 48 hours after the procedure, the patient began with a blunt expectoration and rapidly progressive dyspnea, so she was referred to our hospital.

Biochemistry: 84 mg/dl, 47 mg/dl, creatinine 0.85 mg/dl, Na mEq/l, K 4.3 mEq/l, 105 mEq/l, 6009 troponin-glucose estimated (CK > 0.06)

Blood count: leukocytes 5.1 10e3/μl, hemoglobin 11.2 g/dl, MCV 70, platelets 234 10e3/μl.
Coagulation: prothrombin activity 81%, INR 1.16.
Chest radiography: perihilar interstitial pattern compatible with acute pulmonary edema.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at admission: left ventricle slightly dilated (LVDT 57 mm) with very severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 10-15%).
▁Right ventricle with normal size and function.
Tricuspid aortic valve and normal functioning.
Normal mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation (MI).
Indirect data of increased left filling pressures.
Normal tricuspid valve without insufficiency.
Pulmonary flow type I. Vena cava inferior (VCI) with no inspiratory collapse.
No aortic coarctation.
A SLN was calculated by continuity of care.
Pleural effusion in both lung bases.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): left ventricle (LV) dilated with a telediastolic volume of 164 ml (corrected by body surface area of 100 ml/m2).
132 ml/ m).
EF 20%.
Diffuse hypokinesia with no clear segmental abnormalities.
No▁anomalous intramyocardial enhancements were observed after contrast injection in early or late times.
No significant pericardial effusion was observed.
Study remainder was unchanged.
Severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF 20%).
In the clinical context, it suggests peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Other tests: PCR adenovirus, enterovirus and herpes virus: negative.
Serology of Toxoplasma, CMV, herpes zoster, Epstein-acquired infection VHS 1 and 2, HIV and hepatitis: negative.
Transthoracic echocardiogram at discharge: left ventricle slightly dilated.
Severe LV systolic dysfunction.
LVEF 25%.
Paradoxical septal motion.
▁Right ventricle (RV) undilated with preserved RV systolic function.
Mitral regurgitation in the light range
Normal diastolic Doppler pattern.
Normal diastolic tissue Doppler pattern.
Normal pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) (14 mmHg + PVC).
No vena cava.
▁CLINICAL EVOLUTION The coronary unit is advised when pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is suspected, since the patient has poor general condition, tachypnea, desaturation and tendency to hypotension.
A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed very severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 15%) with hyperdynamic RV, so in the presence of suspected acute pulmonary edema triggered in the emergency unit form of cardiomyopathy.
After being admitted urgently to the coronary care unit, inotropic treatment with dobutamine and diuretics were started, both at high doses.
The evolution was adequate in the underprivileging hours, with significant negative balance, with improvement of organic perfusion data and voiding.
This allowed to gradually diminish the inotropic and diuretic support.
The dobutamine infusion was stopped and neurohormonal treatment with bisoprolol and enalapril was started, with good tolerance.
10 days after admission, the patient was discharged to the cardiology ward, where the study was completed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that ruled out pathological enhancements and inflammatory component at cardiac level with an estimated LVEF of 20%.
With these data, and given the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias in a very young patient, it was decided to implant an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
The subcutaneous route was chosen, given the possible improvement or recovery of ventricular function experienced by some patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy in the following months, as reported in the literature.
A genetic study was requested, finding a frameft variant in the TTN gene (which encodes titin) and which is considered pathogenic.
DIAGNOSIS Acute lung edema.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Implantation of subcutaneous ICD as primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias.
Positive genetic study for pathogenic variant in the titin gene.
