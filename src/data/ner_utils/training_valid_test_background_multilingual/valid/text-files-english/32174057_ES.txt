A 57-year-old man, with no history of respiratory failure, came to the emergency department of Hunan (China) with hemoptysis of 3 hours onset.
Wuhan traveled recently in Wuhan province or had no exposure to 2019-nCoV.
Blood tests at admission were not indicative.
A simple chest CT scan showed a localized area of ground glass opacities in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe.
Lobe at admission A simple thoracic CAT scan showed a localized area of ground glass opacities in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper.
The distribution of the lesions was basically medial.
No lesions were observed in other regions of the lungs.
The patient was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary infection or tuberculosis.
Three days after admission, a small amount of pleural effusion was observed.
No affirmative results were found in the drainage of the pleural effusion.
Hemoptysis could not be controlled with symptomatic treatment, including hemostasis and anti-infective therapy.
Eight days later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that ground glass opacities of the left upper lobe had undergone consolidations.
▁Outcomes at admission day 8. Chest CT showed that ground glass opacities of the left upper lobe had undergone consolidations.
New ground glass opacities were observed in the lingual segment of the left upper lobe and the upper segment of the left lower lobe distributed in subpleural regions.
There were ground glass opacities in the upper segment of the left lower lobe.
On day 10 after admission, hemorrhage in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe was confirmed by fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy.
The patient had fever on day 11 and reached a maximum temperature of 39 °C.
On day 14, the patient developed dyspnea, which progressively worsened.
On day 18 after admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe had decreased, while ground-glass opacities increased in the remaining lungs and consolidations.
The patient showed diffuse consolidations in both lungs, with a butterfly wing pattern and a patchy pattern, as well as air bronchogram.
The ground glass opacities were distributed in the peripheral or subpleural regions.
consolidations in the left lungs on day 18, initial ground-glass opacities, and consolidations in the medial aspect of the upper left lobe had decreased, while diffuse ground-glass opacities increased in the left lungs
A stab pattern and air bronchogram were observed.
Some ground glass opacities were distributed in peripheral or subpleural regions.
COVID-19 infection was finally confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.
Hemoptysis gradually improved and dyspnea was managed with symptomatic treatment and antiviral therapy, according to COVID-19 guidelines.
A chest CT scan showed that consolidations in both lungs had been absorbed; by day 24, the area with ground glass opacities had increased, but its density had decreased.
Results consolidations were clearly absorbed on day 24 after admission.
The area with ground glass opacities had increased, but its density had decreased.
Some ground glass opacities were mixed with small patchy consolidations.
On day 29 after admission, ground glass opacities and a small nucleus of consolidation were still absorbed.
The ground-glass opacities of the first CT scan and the ground-glass opacities and consolidations of the second CT scan in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe were clearly absorbed.
▁Outcomes at admission day 29, ground glass opacities and a small nucleus of consolidation were still absorbed.
The ground-glass opacities of the first CT scan and the ground-glass opacities and consolidations of the second CT scan in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe were clearly absorbed.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Provincial Hospital of Hunan and informed consent was obtained.
