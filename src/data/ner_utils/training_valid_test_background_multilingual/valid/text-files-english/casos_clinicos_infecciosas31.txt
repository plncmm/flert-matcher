A 69-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with low back pain radiating to both lower limbs for 10 months.
Personal history of hypertension with heart disease, non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, moderate COPD (FEV1 ), gouty arthritis and hypertensive emphysema type 76% are highlighted as personal history of interest.
He was under study by Urology for hematuria, diagnosed by cytology of urothelial carcinoma.
He had been a former smoker for 30 years, with no relevant epidemiological history: he denied risky sexual relations, no recent travel abroad, no contact with animals or ingestion of non pasteurized products.
She lives in an urban environment.
It is being treated with AAS 100mg, candesartan 32/ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg, simvastatin 20mg and metformin 850mg.
Allergy to acetaminophen.
The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Department due to a 10-month history of severe low back pain radiating to the lateral aspect of the thigh and left to the external surface of the foot, with paresthesia at that level
Two months before admission, the patient complained of pain in the contralateral joint, which limited her daily life, so she was followed up in the Pain Unit without significant improvement.
He also reported a decrease in strength in both lower limbs of a week of evolution.
It also has urinary retention for ten days so it has required bladder catheterization.
In the directed anamnesis, the appearance of febricula occasionally for a few months without bacteriemic profile is highlighted.
She denies another clinic in the anamnesis directed by organs and devices.
On physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable, afflicted.
Good general condition, conscious and oriented.
Normal muscle balance with lower limb claudication in antigravity maneuvers for pain, no changes in sensitivity, osteotendinous reflexes present and symmetrical except for left abolition locus left Braard.
Cardiac auscultation revealed no murmurs, respiratory sounds preserved with fine crackles in bases.
Abdomen, anodinous.
Lower limbs presented edema with minimal fovea at the perimaleolar level, without signs of deep venous thrombosis, and the pulses were preserved and symmetrical.
It provides a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) reported as lumbar spondylodyscartrosis, predominantly L4-L5 and L5-S1.
At this level there is an extruded herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) with involvement of both lateral recesses, plus the left.
Basic blood and urine analysis was requested, highlighting leukopenia (2750 leukocytes/mm3 with 61.4% polymorphonuclear ions, 21.5% total lymphocytes, 14.9% monocytes, 8.7 mg corrected platelets, serum calcium 8.7 mL
Urine with blood ++, negative rest.
Differential diagnosis We are therefore faced with a patient with a long-standing low back pain refractory to analgesic treatment, associating neurological symptoms attributed to a dyscal hernia that was decided to intervene.
The finding of a bicithin (anemia + leukopenia) in a patient with suspected neoplasia of urothelial origin is also highlighted.
Taking low back pain as a guiding symptom, we should consider the following differential diagnosis, more to less frequently: • Diseases that cause narrowing of the canal or the articular holes, such as herniated disjunction, such as joint hypertrophy.
• Trauma, functional/postural overload, muscle contractures, vertebral fractures
• Degenerative diseases such as arthrosis.
• Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies • Tumors, whether malignant or not, mainly myeloma, sarcoma and metastasis.
• Infections: pyogenic, tuberculous or brucellar spondylodiscitis.
• Miscellaneous: diseases of bone metabolism (osteoporosis, Paget's disease...), congenital anomalies of the lumbar spine, referred pain of visceral origin.
Taking into account the patient's history and the presence of bicitize, a possible diagnosis is that this is a degenerative lesion which reports NMR, but also the primary cause of bone marrow involvement is degenerative lesions.
The patient begins with episodes of self-limiting spatial disorientation, sometimes associated with progressive deterioration of the abdominal condition, and usually associated with worsening of the general condition.
A follow-up laboratory test was performed, which showed worsening of renal function (creatinine levels 3.19 mg/dl), and an abdominal computerized axial tomography (CAT) was performed to rule out a well-advanced lytic lesion in L5-S1.
Interconsultation with Internal Medicine by Neurosurgery was then performed to complete the study.
Complete blood tests revealed a LDH of 845 U/l, with negative or normal tumor markers, proteinogram and immunoglobulins.
Positron emission tomography (PET) shows hypermetabolic foci that correlate by CT with lytic lesions located in L5-S1, SUV 11.53 and 11.18 respectively.
In the rest of the study, no other hypermetabolic foci suggesting the presence of macroscopic tumor activity were observed.
These findings were obtained by CT-guided core needle biopsy of the L5 lesion. A sample was sent for pathological anatomy and microbiology cultured in normal media and mycobacterial culture.
IGRA and hemoculctive colitis with a fever peak are also requested.
While waiting for results, the patient begins with greater deterioration of general status as well as increased pain in the lumbar area, so MRI is performed showing a destructive pattern of the spinal platforms L5-S1.
After administration, the patient is delimited as a voided contrast agent, anterior epidural space (where the talar sac is compressed), and left-sided parapsies.
The findings are compatible with an infectious process (spondylodyscitis).
This result was obtained by puncture of the left psoas abscess, which was sent to microbiology for Gram stain, culture and PCR for tuberculosis.
We have obtained negative results for hemoactive agents, positive IGRA and the microbiology of bone biopsy, which is negative for common bacteria, with growth Mycobacterium complexosa sensitive to anti, Ributin is diagnosed with first line treatment with tuberculosis.
The results of the samples obtained from psoas abscess with smear microscopy, PCR and culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are received.
A complete study was performed with sputum smears, which are negative on 3 occasions with negative culture for TB, although sputum PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was positive.
A chest CT scan was performed and reported as: "Peripheral apical tricial lesion with calcification inside.
Subpleural micronodules are observed in both lobes predominance superior to "pseudo-budget" pattern in bilateral calcified granulomas probably related to previous TBC.
Mediastinal▁ganglia of non-significant size".
After the start of anti-tuberculous abscess treatment and drainage of psoas abscess, the patient progressed favorably, with adequate tolerance to medication, without new complications, and with improvement of analytical parameters.
Final diagnosis Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott's Mal).
Pulmonary tuberculosis.
