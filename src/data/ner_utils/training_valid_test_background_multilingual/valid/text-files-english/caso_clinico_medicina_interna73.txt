A 40-year-old woman with a history of Cogan's syndrome, erythema nodosum, and hepatitis B virus diagnosed in 2004 on long-term treatment with azathioprine and prednisone.
She was admitted due to subacute asthenia, fever and dyspnea.
Physical examination revealed tachypnea at rest, crackles and wheezing at auscultation.
Blood analysis: Leukocytes: 24,100 mm, neutrophils: 77.5 %, hemoglobin: 7 g/dl, with normal mean copulationuscular volume, platelets: 1327 mm, CRP:143 mg/dl.
Gastritis - pH: 7.55.
CP02: 30.
P02: 51, chest radiography bilateral parahilar and peribronchovascular reticulum opacities predominantly in both lung bases, associated with right pleural effusion.
Twelve hours after admission, the patient presented worsening of dyspnea, starting ventilatory support with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (BiPAP), and started antibiotic treatment and corticotherapy.
At 24 hours, the patient presented progressive deterioration with hemodynamic instability requiring vasoactive support.
Acute renal failure, lactic metabolic acidosis, on cardiac auscultation continuous punch biopsy.
An echocardiogram showed severe aortic insufficiency due to a destructured right coronary velum, with stenosis.
Left ventricle slightly dilated, with LVEF 55%.
Vascular computed tomography showed an important bilateral peribronchovascular interstitial pattern.
Pleural effusion was bilateral.
Cardiomegaly, with increased caliber of the cone of the pulmonary artery (3.1 cm) and increased caliber of the intrapulmonary vessels.
Given the findings, it is a common practice in the Cardiac Surgery Department.
Blood culture, surgical specimen culture, and luetic serology : negative.
Aortic valve repair was performed by suture - patch, with favorable evolution.
Cogan's syndrome is a rare entity.
Its clinical presentation is interstitial, vestibular and auditory dysfunction.
Occasionally, it is associated with systemic vasculitides and anorectal malformations.
Acquired aortic stenosis may develop during the disease, being described in approximately 10% of patients, causing proximal dilation of the aorta, aortic disease, coronary artery disease and aortic valve aneurysms ostial regurgitation.
In the present case, the patient presents a subacute process, a diagnostic challenge, which finally in the face of the clinic, her underlying pathology and the imaging tests, the diagnosis of a severe aortic insufficiency and a diagnosis is made.
In the differential diagnosis it was necessary to rule out infectious processes, such as endocarditis, not fulfilling the necessary criteria for diagnosis.
Non infectious colitis related to CoganÂ’s syndrome is present in approximately 10% of patients in the reviewed literature.
Given that both Cogan syndrome and comorbid conditions are rare and due to the complexity of the case, it is relevant to review and report the clinical case.
AngioTAC imaging: A prominent pulmonary parenchymal pattern is visualized as an important bilateral peribronchovascular interstitial-alveolar pattern.
Pleural effusion was bilateral.
Cardiomegaly, with increased caliber of the cone of the pulmonary artery (3.1 cm).
