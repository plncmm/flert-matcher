Anamnesis A 63-year-old woman with a personal history of hypertension and epilepsy (complex partial seizures) on carbamazepine, verbal information from the family, was not available for follow-up outside her usual medical residency).
Good seizure control.
He had been in crisis for more than five years.
Standard treatment: anaphylaxis and enalapril.
No toxic consumption.
The patient was taken to the Emergency Department due to confusion and confusion of a few hours of evolution.
For one week, the patient had episodes of a few seconds of disconnection, with fixed gaze and movements of the hands that resolved spontaneously, without another accompanying person.
The day after admission she presented two generalized tonic-clonic seizures and right hemiparesis.
Physical examination revealed hypertension 165/92 mmHg, heart rate 73 bpm, temperature 36.2oC.
Neurological alteration: tendency to sleep, although devoid of verbal stimuli.
Unconstrained, with the need to repeat orders.
It comprehends simple and scarcely complex orders.
Scarce spontaneous language (single or monosyllable words)
Repite and name properly.
Moderate dysarthria.
Normal-threat Campimetry.
▁Right supranuclear facial palsy
▁Right hemiparesis with crural predominance.
Skin-plantar left flexor, indifferent right.
Live tendinous os - generalized live theo tendinous.
No changes in sensitivity.
▁Complementary tests • Blood count, biochemistry and coagulation: normal.
• Mildly increased liver enzymes: glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase 91 IU/l, glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase 116 IU/l.
• Antinuclear antibodies, neutrophil anticytoplasmic, anti-Ro, anti-La: negative.
• Negative angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).
• Serology of hepatitis B and C virus, immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Brucella, Borrelia, cytomegalovirus, herpes, human Ebstein-zoster virus, varicella-zoster virus negative
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Primer analysis: 2 cells, normal rest.
Second: normal.
Third: normal.
Negative culture.
▁Cytology: absence of cells, abundant proteinaceous material with very few normal lymphocytes.
• Transthoracic echocardiography: normal.
• Repeated electroencephalograms (EEG): signs of diffuse brain involvement in conjunction with the presence of▁epileptiform paroxysmal abnormalities in the left hemisphere without a pattern of status.
• Doppler of the supraaortic trunks (SAT) and TCD: normal.
• Cranial computed tomography (CT): mild cortical-subcortical.
Subcentimetric hypodense image on the right paramedial margin of the lump compatible with lacunar infarction.
Images suggestive of lacunar infarctions located in both putamen and in the head of the left caudate nucleus.
Hypodense images of the white matter, of small size in both cerebral hemispheres, suggest areas of gliosis secondary to multi-infarction disease.
• Contrast-enhanced cranial CT: no evidence of sinus venous thrombosis.
Study challenge was similar to the initial CT.
• Non-contrast-enhanced cranial CT (3 days after the initial CT scan): two hypodense lesions are observed in the left frontal and left posterior parietal lobes, compatible with acute/sub-acute ischemic events.
• Venous MRA: hypoplasia of the sigmoid sinus and left internal jugular vein, with no clear signs of venous thrombosis.
• skull MRI: ischemic lesions in the left frontal and parietal areas in the territory of the left MCA.
Patched lesions suggestive of chronic ischemic lesions, leuko-araiosis and gliosis in the radiata corona, semioval centers, internal capsule and basal▁ganglia, compatible with small vessel disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull, FLAIR sequence: bilateral ischemic lesions consistent with small vessel disease are observed.
In the diffusion sequence, a left hemisphere lesion that restricts diffusion is observed, compatible with acute infarction in the borderline territory between the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery.
• Arteriography: small and medium caliber multifocal stenosis of cerebral vasculitis.
Lateral arteriography image showed small areas of stenosis at the level of small and medium-sized vessels, suggestive of vasculitis.
•▁Right temporal biopsy (including superficial temporal artery, dura mater and cortex of the right temporal anterior pole): no remarkable findings.
Ev during his admission to Neurology, he presented complex partial seizures lasting minutes with right limb clanias and secondary generalization.
The patient was admitted to the ICU with no response to the third day of treatment, presenting three tonic-clonic seizures in one hour, without conscientious level, compatible with seizure status, and recovery unit (ICU).
During his stay in the ICU he required midazolam along with treatment with LEV, PTH, LCS, CBZ, without seizure control and persistence of cloth sedation in the right side.
She required invasive mechanical ventilation.
She also presented infectious complications.
He suffered nosocomial pneumonia, which was treated with cloxacillin and meropenem by isolation in grams of bacilli and gram negative▁cocci.
As for the neurological status, right hemisphere brain damage was controlled with antiepileptic treatment mentioned above, and it was possible to remove BZD.
As a result of the clinical evolution, with crisis of difficult control and the presence of diffuse ischemic lesions in the neuroimaging, an angiographic study was performed due to suspicion of central nervous system vasculitis (CNS).
The findings supported the diagnosis and treatment with high-dose corticoids (methylprednisolone 1 g for 5 days and subsequent regimen of 60 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/day.
Initially, the patient's clinical situation improved progressively, regaining consciousness, directing the gaze and mobilizing the right limbs, and extubation was possible.
Mans situation of mutism with agitation episodes.
Neurology unit was once more established in the ICU.
In the plant he suffered two episodes of reversible respiratory arrest without cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA), and on a third occasion he presented cardiorespiratory arrest for about 15 minutes; after the maneuvers of resuscitation, he maintained the vital signs EEG.
After almost 3 months of hospitalization, the patient developed a new CPA and died.
The family did not accept necropsy.
