Anamnesis A 66-year-old male, born in Colombia, with hypertension, diabetes on insulin therapy, dyslipidemia and a history of ischemic heart disease.
Kidney transplant recipient due to diabetic nephropathy (fourth month after transplantation), under treatment with tacrolimus (11.5 mg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (720 mg/day) and prednisone (5 mg/day).
The patient came to the emergency room for a clinical picture of a week of evolution, consisting of constant, burning pain that affected the whole surface of the scalp, face and neck to its implantation base.
From its beginning, it had become progressively more intense until it acquired intensity 10/10 on the visual analog scale.
The patient did not improve with usual analgesia and exacerbated with constipation.
It did not change with decubitus or Valsalva maneuvers.
No circadian rhythm was observed.
No fever or nausea or vomiting were associated.
Four days before, the patient had undergone bilateral neck surgery due to benign cutaneous neoformation.
On physical examination, the patient complained of allodynia affecting the scalp, face and neck.
Examination by ophthalmology revealed bilateral conjunctivitis.
The rest of the examination was normal, including the eye fundus and intraocular pressure (IOP) (16 mmHg in both eyes).
The patient was discharged with symptomatic treatment for pain and episodes of colitis associated with the condition.
Four days later, the patient came to the emergency department again due to persistent headache and fever in the last 48 hours, with temperature up to 40oC, chills and thiritone.
Physical examination Constants: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 113 bpm, temperature 39.6 oC, basal oxygen saturation 97%, capillary glucose 393 mg/dl.
Dry skin and mucous membranes
Well nourished and perfused.
Tachypnea.
No oral ulcers.
Alodynia, foot ulcers, face and neck
Jaundice crackles on lung auscultation
Normal systemic examination.
Left atrial fibrillation: IOP 20 mmHg, eye drops 16 mmHg.
Neurological orientation: conscious, attentive, time, space and person.
Language and speech were unaltered.
Normal bilateral funduscopy.
Left Ptosis.
Edema and ecchymosis of the left upper eyelid with increased temperature at the local level.
Left-sided reactive mydriasis.
In the left eye, extrinsic movements abolished in all kinds of anaesthesia (including insanctionary movements and ocular manifestations).
Two in the right eye without limitations.
V motor and sensory, VII and normal lower pairs.
Normal motor, sensory and coordination.
Negative meningeal signs.
▁Complementary tests • Analytical in the emergency room: haemoglobin 9.6 g/dl, haematocrit lactate 84μ coagulation disorder 126 μg mean corpuscular volume 8dl, fibrinogen relative leukocytes 15,600/μl (neutrophils: absolute urea/89 mmol/μl)
Venous gas: normal.
Urine output: glycosuria 1,000 mg/dl, urinary tract infections 0.
Normal rectum.
• Lumbar puncture: cloudy cerebrospinal fluid
Haematological 6/μl, leukocytes 1,100/μl (95% polymorphonuclear, 5% mononuclear), proteins 78 mg/dl, glucose 110 mg/dl, cryptococcal antigen (Ag) negative.
Fungic and bacteriological culture: negative.
Negative cytology for malignancy.
• Chest X-ray: normal.
• Cranial and orbital computed tomography (CT): enlargement of preseptal soft tissues, lateral to the left eyeball and adjacent to the ocular insertion of the left lateral rectus sheath cystitis, compatible with▁orbital.
The etiology of the sinus is unknown.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): sinus occupation is a rare congenital disorder with thickening of the mucosa and a central image within 2 cm markedly hypointense on T2-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T1-weighted sequences.
Asymmetrical enhancement of the left▁orbital sinus wall and apex in relation to inflammatory process by neighborhood.
Hyperintense foci in the FLAIR sequence at the level of the deep white matter of both frontal lobes, right parietal and left occipital lobe, and head of the left caudatid nucleus, with acute contrast enhancement sequence after infarction.
The angiography sequence showed absence of filling of the synovium, distal portion of the sphenoparietal sinus and petrous sinuses on the left side, suggesting sinus thrombosis.
• Pathological anatomy nasosinusal mucosa: bacterial colonies intermingled with abundant philamentous fungal structures of thick, unseptated wall, with multiple ramifications showing little or no staining technique).
• Nasosinusal▁exudate culture: colonization by Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus hominis hominis and Streptococcus viridans group.
Diagnosis • Rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis (COMR).
• Left sinus septic thrombosis.
• Multiple cerebral infarctions secondary to vascular fungal invasion
Treatment and evolution The patient was a diabetic and immunosuppressed patient (fourth month after renal transplantation), with a clinical picture of ten days of pain and holocraneal allodynia associated with fever in the last 48 hours, cervical and facial.
Examination showed paralysis of the third, fourth and VI left cranial nerves, with reactive mydriasis, slight increase in IOP and signs of▁orbital lithiasis.
Initially, the level of consciousness was good and there were no data on meningism or other focus.
The patient met clinical and analytical criteria for sepsis.
These findings revealed intracranial infection with involvement of the left sinus and/or intraorbital infectious process with involvement of the superior▁orbital fissure.
Cranial CT scan showed sinusitis as a constriction cyst and▁orbital emphysema.
Disseminated intracranial infectious process was suspected and a lumbar puncture was performed, which showed polymorphonuclear pleocytosis.
Gram and Ag of cryptococci were negative.
Empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftacidima, linezolid and ampicillin was immediately initiated.
In the following hours the patient presented a worsening of the level of consciousness.
An urgent brain MRI showed sinus thrombosis and occupation of the left sinus suggestive of sinusitis.
Coronal and axial sections of brain magnetic resonance, T1-weighted sequence.
The sinus is located in the left lobe with a hyperintense central image.
Asymmetrical enhancement of the left▁orbital sinus wall and apex.
Amphotericin B was administered intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day and an urgent sphenoidectomy was performed the following day.
Nevertheless, the patient continued with fluctuating level of consciousness and required admission to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring.
Medication administered at minimal doses was reduced, cassava was administered and anticoagulation with intravenous heparin was initiated.
Anatomopathological examination showed tissue invasion due to filariasis non-septated, compatible with mucormycosis.
Nasosinusal mucosa.
Hematoxylineosin staining, objective 20 increases. Schiff periodic acid technique (SPA), objective 40 increases.
Acute inflammatory infiltrate and tissue invasion due to thick, unseptated wall thickening with multiple ramifications.
During evolution, he presented right hemiparesis, in relation to acute infarctions in the left thalamus and internal capsule, probably secondary to vascular fungal invasion.
Despite the therapeutic measures, the patient presented unfavorable worsening of consciousness and finally died 17 days after admission.
