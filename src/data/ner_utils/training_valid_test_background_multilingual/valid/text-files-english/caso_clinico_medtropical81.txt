A 43-year-old male patient, born in Lima from Caracas, Venezuela, with a previous diagnosis of HIV, with chronic diarrhea, CD4 count of 108 cells/mL and viral load greater than 500 000 copies/mL.
HAART therapy was initiated with efavirenz, lamivudine and zidovudine; during treatment she had fever of 39 Â°C, asthenia, weight loss and persistence of diarrheal stools.
She was initially hospitalized in Venezuela and presented pancit, PPD 0 mm, chest X-ray with no relevant findings, and abdominal CT scan with hepatomegaly and nodular lesions in the spleen.
The anatomopathological study of liver and spleen samples showed granulomatous hepatitis and chronic granulomatous splenic inflammation.
In addition, inguinal lymph node biopsy was nonspecific (chronic granulomatous lymph node involvement).
BAAR staining and staining of these samples were negative.
Because of this, it was decided to start anti-tuberculin treatment and amphotericin B E.V.
without clinical improvement.
Posterior chest imaging (ultrasound and tomography) showed miliary infiltrate suggestive of miliary TB.
Search strategy for NIH, PCP, MAC, DVT.
As there is no improvement, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is suspected.
A new CT scan showed hypodense images of the liver and the spleen. A pelvic CT scan also showed a left ischiopausal abscess.
The abscess sample was submitted to PCR that was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The first phase of antituberculosis was prolonged and amikacin and ofloxacin were added to the possibility of MDR-TB.
The patient then travels to Lima and is hospitalized at the National Hospital Cayetano Heredia.
The initial evaluation revealed hepatomegaly without lymphadenopathy, surgical wound (previous biopsy) in the right inguinal region with serous secretion.
A new abdominal CT scan with an increased b size was performed, as well as multiple nodular and hypodense lesions distributed throughout the splenic parenchyma.
A sensitivity study of TB was performed, which showed to be sensitive to rifampicin and resistant to isoniazid, pyrazinamide and etambu bag.
Total nephrectomy was performed and pathological studies showed positive AFB.
Treatment was initiated with levofloxacin, rifampicin, ethionamide, capreomycin and amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid.
The splenic culture result was positive for Mycobacterium fortumen, with PCR positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
For these reasons, a management scheme was established with linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, capreomycin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, with which the patient had a favorable outcome.
Treatment was completed with pyrazinamide, rifampicin, capreomycin, cycloserine and ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
Subsequently, the patient is discharged with a CD4 count of 455 cells/mL.
