We describe the first case of anisakiasis in Colombia and summarize the available medical literature.
A 52-year-old woman presented with acute epigastric pain of sudden onset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and urticaria after eating fish.
Physical examination revealed moderate sensitivity in the epigastrium.
Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis, while plain radiography and electrocardiogram did not show any abnormality.
The diagnosis was made by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed thickening of the gastric wall and thickening in movement.
Anisakis larva was found and it was removed by endoscopy, which caused pain in the patient.
Clinically, anisakiasis can present as a gastric, intestinal, other systems or allergic disease.
The diagnosis is based on the preparation of the patient's feeding and direct visualization of the larvae; the only effective treatment consists in endoscopic removal.
Anisakiasis is a‚ñÅzoonotic parasitic disease caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish or shellfish infected with nematodes of the genus Anisakis and Contraca, Pseudoecumra.
