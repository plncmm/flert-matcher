Anamnesis A 78-year-old man was allergic to pyrazolones and had no toxic habits.
The family history included a father who died from bladder cancer and a brother who died from lung cancer.
Among his personal history of hepatitis in digestive tract follow-up since arterial biopsy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and surgical intervention of duodenal ulcus in 1969 with subsequent high bleeding, requiring transfusion of blood products, with transmission of chronic HCV (1992).
He underwent multiple dual therapy with interferon+avirin in 1996 and later peginterefon alfa-2b+ allergic rhinitis in 2009 with partial response and subsequent relapse.
The usual treatment was taking Omeprazole 20 mg, Amloxetine 5mg, Losartan/Hychlorothiazide 100/25mg, Pregabalin 75mg and Lormetazepam 1mg.
The patient was asymptomatic from the clinical point of view and followed up controls in the digestive consultation.
Abdominal ultrasound in November 2013, showed a diffuse chronic liver disease, 2 cm nodule (cm) in undetermined segment VI liver, colitis and renal cyst of 12 cm in the right kidney.
The study was completed by computed tomography (Computed Axial Tomography) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (early nodular hepatocellular cyst) with a 28-millimeter nodular lesion type (BCC) in segment VI, hypervascular in phase
Given these antecedents, he was evaluated by the General Surgery Service, performing cholecystectomy and hepatic segmentectomy on March 28, 14, being the pathological anatomy of CHC moderately or differentiated grade II , presence of multinodular nerve invasion and inconversion.
In the postoperative period, the patient presented a liver abscess requiring percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, requiring several admissions.
The patient was followed up in general surgery consultations and was asymptomatic.
Physical Education:
Weight 80 kg (Kg).
Size 182 cm.
Body Surface 2m2.
Gastrointestinal disorders:
The patient presented hepatomegaly of 2 layers, and a fistula orifice in the right hypochondrium with seropurulent material coming out of the surface.
There were no signs of peritoneal irritation and peristalsis.
Physical examination revealed no abnormalities‚ñÅComplementary tests - In October 2014 NMR control, disease progression was observed, with the appearance of multiple subcentimetric nodular lesions throughout the entire liver parenchyma, affecting mainly segments VICH VII.
Persistence of a fistulous tract that communicates the surgical cavity with the abdominal wall and small biliary leakage.
The patient also had septic shock and portal hypertension.
- Analytically, stands out alpha-fetoprotein of 105 ng/mL (normal values up to 10 ng/mL), GOT 101U/L, GPT 108 U/L and GGT 259 U/L respectively (normal values)
Diagnosis With the diagnosis of unresectable recurrence of CHC on zyrotic liver due to HCV, is seen at the first visit by physician on October 30, 2014.
Treatment The patient is a candidate for oral treatment with sorafenib 200 mg, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 2 tablets every 12 hours, starting on November 5, 2014.
During treatment, the patient presented grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity, mainly grade 3 platelets, which resolved temporary discontinuation of the drug and subsequent reintroduction, but at half the dose.
Nodular growth and progression of all lesions were observed during 4 months with sorafenib and tests were ordered to see the response to traction, showing progressive elevation of the alpha-fetoprotein ( 187 ng/mL) and in
In turn, growth of the surgical bed of a previous lumpectomy occupied by bilioma was observed, without data of overinfection.
Given the MRI findings and the absence of active treatments against the neoplasic process, it was decided to continue with symptomatic treatment exclusively.
Monthly controls were followed in medical consultations where the patient was virtually asymptomatic except for grade 1 asthenia and had a normal active life.
In a new September 2015 NMR, a decrease in global hepatic volume was observed, especially in segments VI and VII, together with a marked decrease in the number and size of lesions visualized in the study.
Residual lesions are hypovascular in the dynamic study, without logarding the identification of real lesions in the arterial phase, typical of hepatocarcinoma, which leads to a spontaneous regression of the disease or origin infectious lesions prior to cancer.
3 ng/mL remained within normal limits, and another NMR was performed in January 2016, with no foci of pathological enhancement in the arterial phase descended to normal levels (hepatocarcinoma and analytically).
The patient, at the same time, has followed controls by the gastrointestinal service, which after not observing tolerance in avid images and hepatocellular carcinoma in imaging tests, requested in January 2016 a combination of three antiviral drugs 250mg/ 100mg plus 250mg
Analytically, a progressive decrease in HCV viral load has been observed since the beginning of these treatments.
On the other hand, he has followed controls by general surgery for presenting reducible epigastric incisional hernia, pending the performance of incisional hernia repair and abscess drainage if possible, which will be performed once scheduled for July 2016 antiviral treatment.
Subsequently, the physician will refer the patient again to the outpatient clinic for follow-up.
