Visual disturbance was defined as a reality.
The clinical case is developed in the field of Primary Care and later in Hospital Emergency, to complete the study.
Individual focus (anamnesis, examination, complementary tests) Personal history: no allergies to medication, hypertension, non-smoker or drinker, permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2015 with moderate endoscopic sinus stenosis
He underwent cataract surgery in his left eye in 2017.
Baseline situation: independent for basic activities of daily living, preserved upper functions.
Walk alone.
Living with your wife
Usual treatment: Sintrom 4 mg 1 daily, eutirox 150 mg, furosem 40 mg every 12 h, propylene 20 mg every 24 h, amyloid 5 mg 1 day.
An 87-year-old patient who consulted the Health Center referring to visual disturbance for two weeks (zo type of minor judgment or tam or: worms, generous anxiety, chickens...)
Afebril.
No consumption of new drugs or toxics.
No data suggestive of clinical infection.
No dyspnea, no chest pain.
No previous stressful situations.
Followed by her wife, she reported that she had not had behavior unusual in the past weeks, not affecting her quality of life in a marked way, and could perform her usual activity.
No cognitive impairment.
Location: hemodynamic stability TA 130, FC 65 bpm, afferent.
Aware, time-oriented and collaborative, with judgment of reality criticizing the visually preserved.
Eupneic at rest without work of breathing
There were no relevant findings on cardiac auscultation or abdominal examination.
No lower limb edema.
Neurological involvement within the eye: isochoric and reactive light pupils, preserved external eye movements, normal confrontation campimetry (although the normal limits persist at all times).
No ataxia or tremor.
Stored march.
Romberg negative.
No neurological focus.
Mini-Mental Test without cognitive deterioration, and negative toxic test.
It was decided to refer the patient to the emergency room of a reference hospital because it is the first episode of visual disturbance in an independent patient without previous cognitive impairment.
To rule out organicity.
▁Complementary tests Blood analysis: leukocytes 6,110, hemoglobin 8.5 (chronic anemia already studied with similar values in the previous analytical tests), platelets 237,000.
INR 2.3.
Glucose 103, urea 51, creatinine 2 (similar previous control 2,3), normal, non-increasing acute phase reactants.
Vitamin B12 and thyroids were normal in the laboratory one week ago.
Normal urine.
Chest and abdominal X-rays were normal.
Cranial CT: no acute findings of interest Assessment by Ophthalmology: visual acuity 0.3/ 0.1, right cataract.
Left pseudophakicosis due to left cataract surgery, with opacification of the posterior capsule.
Dry bilateral AMD.
Neurology and Psychiatry assessment ruled out pathology at these levels.
Clinical judgement (problem finding, differential diagnosis) Clinical judgement: Charles Bonnet syndrome in a patient with poor bilateral visual acuity due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Differential diagnosis: psychiatric pathology (schizophrenia, delusional disorder...), neurological (dementia of laser bodies action-cataract primary dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, delirium...), toxic drugs of new onset
This would improve the visual acuity of the patient, and may disappear in part the visually impaired.
Otherwise, there is no treatment of choice for Charles Bonnet syndrome.
Antidepressant drugs, antidepressant drugs, cholinergic agents, and neurotic agents have been used for their treatment.
However, currently there is not enough clinical evidence to select a specific pharmacological treatment.
This, together with the hygienic measures (adequate reception, being accompanied...) improves the symptomatology.
Ev: in our patient, low dose risperidone was used with acceptable results.
This, together with the ocular intervention, decreased the frequency of mental disorders, improving the patients distress and quality of life.
