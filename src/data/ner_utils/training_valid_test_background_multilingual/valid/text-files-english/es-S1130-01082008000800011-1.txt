A 46-year-old male patient, diagnosed with classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, mixed cellularity variety, stage IV-B with medullary, hepatic and splenic involvement, under treatment with chemotherapy (scaled ECOPP).
In the chemotherapy induction phase (day 11) begins with fever, chills and melena.
Laboratory tests showed neutropenia (100 leukocytes/mm3) and platelet count.
She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. During her admission she suffered from lower gastrointestinal bleeding with hypovolemic shock, requiring intubation and transfusion of blood products.
Upper endoscopy identified a large ulceration of 2-3 cm in the proximal jejunum with smooth edges and necrotic background, without active bleeding.
The anatomopathological study of the biopsy taken from the edges of the ulcer showed several fragments of small intestine mucosa, some ulcerated, with a dense mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with numerous large cells in the mucous layer of the foreign body.
CT identified a thickening of the intestinal wall in the yey, measuring 4.5 cm in diameter, multiple lesions in both lobes of the liver and lytic involvement of the vertebral bodies at the dorsal level.
Treatment with amphotericin B was initiated, with glycemic control and a strenuous surgery was performed.
The patient underwent surgery with a plastron located in and with affectation of transverse mesocolon, with double perforation covered by the roof of the cervix and ileum.
The pathological study of the piece of resection of fibrin and ileum fat showed ulceration and intense acute and chronic inflammation with double perforation and adhesion of loops secondary to infection by Zigomycetes extensive medium-sized necrosis vessels.
The hyphae are thick, of variable diameter, branch in different angles and in the coronal sections show a clear and reinforced membrane.
These hyphae were positive with PAS techniques and metanamine for dementia.
The patient did not suffer complications from the surgery.
After one year of follow-up, the patient is still alive and his lymphoma is in remission.
