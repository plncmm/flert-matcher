A 65-year-old woman with hypertension, autoimmune hypothyroidism and known exposure to COVID-19 came to the emergency department with fatigue, fever, dry cough and abdominal discomfort, with a 4-day evolution.
Upon admission she was afflicted with a respiratory rate of 28 r.p.m.
and an 89% oxygen saturation in room air; a bilateral decrease in respiratory sounds and biannual rales was observed.
Abdominal examination was normal.
The laboratory tests showed normal leukocytes, hemoglobin (14.2 g/dl) and thrombocytes (183,000 per mm tapered).
The C-reactive protein value was high, with 55 mg/l, and liver function tests revealed stasis.
A oropharyngeal swab test for COVID-19 was positive.
A chest CT scan revealed ground glass opacities in the lower areas.
The patient was admitted and started on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid IV, low molecular weight heparin and oxygen.
On day 4, purpura and epistaxis appeared in the lower limbs.
Isolated thrombocytopenia was observed (thrombocytes: 66,000 per mm tapered); this result led to the withdrawal of heparin and antibiotics.
On day 5, the number of thrombocytes was 16,000 per mm tapered and on day 7, 8,000 per mm tapered.
Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal; fibrinogen concentration was 5 g per litre (normal range: 2 to 4).
A peripheral blood smear showed less than 1% of schistoocytes.
Thyroid peroxidase antibody value was 245 U per milliliter (normal value < 35); no antinuclear antibodies, antithrombotic antibodies or antithrombocytic factor 4 were detected.
IV immunoglobulin was administered.
1 g per kg bodyweight.
After 48 hours, the number of thrombocytes decreased to 1,000 per mm clinq and purpuric lesions progressed, leading to a second administration of immunoglobulin at a dose of 1g per kg.
A bone marrow aspirate showed normal cellularity with an increase in polymorphous megakaryocytes.
Erythroblastic and granulocytic cell lines were normal, with no evidence of hemophagocytosis.
On day 9, the patient reported right frontal headache, without fever, vomiting or neurological focality.
A cranial CAT scan showed subarachnoid microarray in the right frontal lobe.
Thrombocyte count was 2,000 per mm clot and thrombocyte transfusion was performed with 100 mg prednisolone; eltrombopag (75 mg per day) was initiated.
On day 10, headache had no new neurological manifestations and the number of thrombocytes increased to 10,000 per mm.
All other analytical tests had normalized except fibrinogen, which remained high (3.5 g per litre).
On the 13th day, the number of thrombocytes was 139,000 per mm.
