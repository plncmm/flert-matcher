PACI VARÓN DE 50 AÑOS que comes to the periodontist sent by his family.
He's never taken to the dentist.
Its main reason for consultation is: to end chaos of my mouth that, because of fear I don't have and now I have general discomfort in all my mouth and tooth mobility.
As for his medical history, he is an ASA I, non-smoker patient.
In this case we will apply the decision-making tree for the classification of periodontitis by stages and degrees.
A new patient underwent a complete radiographic study, an extraoral and intraoral comprehensive exploration and recording of periodontal parameters.
In the extraoral examination we only found abnormality in breathing habit, which is mainly oral.
In the intraoral, a congenital interincisor diastema and a narrow band of▁keratinized tissue in #43 buccal were observed.
In addition, there is a large amount of bacterial deposits and an aspect of the gingival margin with significant changes in size, shape, texture and color.
The gingivae appear enlarged, edematous, blistering and violaceous.
Periapical radiographic examination shows clearly detectable bone loss (PO).
Also, in the complete periodontal study there is loss of clinical attachment (PIC), fear of depth of probing and high rate of bleeding.
With these diagnostic tests we can suspect that the patient has periodontitis and we can continue with the clinical decision-making tree for the classification of stages and degrees.
As an additional diagnostic test, the quality of the alienate was measured by Oral-Chch®, registering high values of volatile compounds and hydrogen proteins (such as methylCHCHMS) in the sample (mycobacterial metabolism of certain materials).
In 2016, this patient was diagnosed with the classification of 1999 as generalized advanced chronic periodontitis, generalized agenesis of furcation lesions, generalized mobility, severe objective halitosis, caries in 26 distal congenital and days
In the case of the current classification we would follow step 2, and through the records taken we confirmed that it is periodontitis since there is bone loss (PO), loss of clinical attachment (PIC), bleeding on probing and furcation lesions.
This step takes into account the extent of the disease, so that if periodontitis affects more than 30% of teeth is considered generalized.
Once the extension has been established, we proceeded to step 3b to classify the stage, starting with the severity.
This patient has ICP > 5 mm and radiographic PO > 1/3 of the roots, therefore, is a patient with stage III or IV periodontitis.
We are in the stage to establish the stage according to the complexity and in our case the patient presents PS > 6 mm, dental migration and dental accommodation of the teeth class II patient with stage IV generalized furious lesion.
Once the stage of the patient is established, the degree of progression of the disease is estimated, which, if there are no previous records, is established by means of a ratio between bone loss and the age of the patient, as well as taking into account.
In this particular case, the patient would be generalized periodontitis stage IV C. The patient received basic periodontal treatment consisting of oral hygiene instructions and motivational techniques, scraping and root planning.
