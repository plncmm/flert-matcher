Anamnesis A 44-year-old male patient, native of Arg, with no known drug allergies and a history of bronchial hyperreactivity episodes treated occasionally with salbutamol.
Tobacco smoker of 16 packs/year and cannabis smoker and hachís.
He has lived in Spain for 15 years and all his relatives live abroad.
The patient consults several times 2014 in the Emergency Department for a month of evolution characterized by episodes of edema with facial predominance and periocular oriented as angioedema.
She was treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines, with no improvement.
She also suffered from generalized weakness with myalgia, anorexia with weight loss of 10 kg, high dysphagia and cough with persistent mucous expectoration.
Physical examination revealed proximal muscle weakness, non-painful hepatopharyngoectasia, erythema multiforme, swelling in the left arm, Gottron's▁papules with telangiectasia.
Nasal fibroscopy revealed a nodular lesion in the right hemisphere, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, behind and below the rim.
No cervical lymphadenopathy was observed.
Additional tests » General analysis:▁lymphopenia, AST 713 IU/l, ALT 281 IU/l, LDH 2,505 IU/l, CK 27000 IU/l.
» Immunological study: ANA positive (1/160), anti-SSA (RO) positive, anti-dsDNA antibody levels, anti-Jo1 and anti-Mi2 negative, alpha-1 antitrypsin
Tumor markers were negative.
» EMG: myopic pattern.
» Muscle biopsy: immune-mediated myopathy type dermatomyositis.
» CT: important emphysema with biphasic predominance with formation of large bullae, to rule out alpha-antitrypsin deficiency.
Left apical cavitary lesion with walls.
Images with tree-in-bud in the apical part of the right lower lobe.
« Conservative management» ,with no evidence of neoformative pathology.
Progression of areas in the right thoracic tree-in-bud and appearance of cavitated lesions biapical, suspecting reactivation of TBC.
» Normal fibrobronchoscopy.
» IGRA: negative.
Lowenstein and Ziehl-Nielsen negative.
» Bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS): positive for Haemophilus influenzae.
» 18-F-PET-CT: focal hypermetabolic FDG deposition in the right parietal region on the temporal lobe.
Nasal fibroscopy with excisional biopsy with positive pathology for poorly differentiated carcinoma.
» Cranial MRI: nodular lesion in the right hemisphere suggestive of primary tumor lesion.
Diagnosis Lack of differentiation of the right hemisphere, cT1N0M0 (stage I), with dermatomyositis as paraneoplastic syndrome.
Treatment Given the suspicion of dermatomyositis (DM), muscle biopsy is performed, which confirms the diagnosis.
Corticosteroid treatment was started (1 mg/kg/day) and subsequently, given the poor clinical improvement, with immunoglobulins (0.4 mg/kg/day) for 5 consecutive days every 28 days, and then the dose was increased to 1 g.
Given the persistence of severe weakness muscle rehabilitation is requested.
The patient also presented progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, requiring the placement of a nasogastric tube for feeding in order to avoid aspiration.
Because of patient intolerance to the tube, percutaneous gastrostomy was decided to continue enteral nutrition.
A chest CT showed a cavitary lesion due to tuberculosis (TB).
Fiberoptic▁bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS) was requested, which was negative for mycobacteria and positive for Haemophilus influenzae, treated according to the antibiogram.
Control CT ruled out an interstitial pattern associated with dermatomyositis, but reactivation of active cavitated lesions was observed, with the initiation of treatment for tuberculosis suggestive of isoniazid, and four drugs for tuberculosis (TBC).
The case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary committee of otorhinolaryngology, considering chemotherapeutic treatment (QT-RDT) with radical intention given the association of dermatomyositis as paraneoplastic syndrome.
The patient was admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of chronic constipation.
The patient undergoes concomitant chemo-RDT with radical intention, CDDP scheme 100 mg/m2 every 21 days and 3D external radiation therapy of modulated intensity (IMRT) on the tumor bed and 69 total Gydos cervical chains in 33.
Subsequently, she is a candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy Al-Sarraf scheme for three cycles.
The first cycle of QT is administered CDDP 80% scheme for hypoalbuminemia and anemia.
Given the social context, it is decided to go to the social-sanitary center for convalescence and continue with rehabilitation.
The patient was admitted with chemotherapy-RDT in February 2015 with mild side effects such as epithelitis and mucositis grade 2.
The patient presented progressive improvement of dysphagia, currently▁tolerating a▁crushed diet with persistence of the defect.
