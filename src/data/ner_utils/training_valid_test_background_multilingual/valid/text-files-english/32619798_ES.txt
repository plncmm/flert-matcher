A 68-year-old man with no medical history was admitted on March 22, 2020 to a local hospital with fever, cough and dyspnea for 8 days.
I hadn't traveled recently.
Her temperature was above 40°C, her respiratory rate was 24▁rpm.
and oxygen saturation was 95% in room air.
A chest X-ray showed results compatible with pneumonia.
She was treated with piperacillin/tazo.
Nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was positive for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The patient got worse and was intubated two days after hospitalization; he was treated in the ICU for 11 days.
She did not exceed a spontaneous breathing trial and reintubation was performed 48 hours after extubation.
She was admitted to the ICU of the University Hospital of Aarhus due to the impossibility of mechanical ventilation withdrawal, muscle weakness and multiple organ failure.
Central nervous system images and cerebrospinal fluid analysis ruled out neuroinfection or structural lesions.
Clinical examination revealed several symmetric severe distal and proximal weaknesses (score in the Medical Research Council index: 2/5), diffuse osteotendinous muscle weakness and absence of reflexes.
On day 65 of hospitalization, nerve conduction studies and a quantitative electromyogram with conventional methods were performed due to suspicion of Guillain-Assisted Syndrome (GBS) or polyneuropathy in critically ill patients.
The abnormal results in the electromyography were reduced motor unit potentials (MPU), consistent with myopathy in the brachial bitumen and the vastus medialis non-contrasted with passive movements of anterior tibial non-contraceptives.
A left peroneal motor conduction velocity was observed in the ankle (27.8 m/s), but its superficial action decreased (42 bilateral perone m/s); the right motor response was absent, as well as the potentialities decreased.
▁Sensory nerve conduction studies were normal in the median nerves (CV: 53.7m/s, amplitude: 10.2μV), ulnar (CV: 51.2m/s, amplitude: 2.7μV, right: 2.8μV).
Furthermore, reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potential (CMPA) were observed in median (2.3mV), ulnar (1.6mV) and tibial (right: 0.9mV, left: 0.9mV) nerves.
The duration of the CMA was only increased in the median nerve (8.5 ms) and was normal in the ulnar (6.9 ms) and tibial (right: 7.2 ms, left: 7.3 ms) nerves.
F waves were absent in all motor nerves.
In the right median nerve, a stimulating nerve stimulation was performed at 20 Hz with a pulse of 1 second; immediately after, F waves with normal latencies and minimal frequencies were easily obtained.
There was no decrease with a stimulation at 3 Hz.
In conclusion, the results indicated critical patient myopathy (CPM), but not GBS or CPP.
