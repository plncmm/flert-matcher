A 78-year-old male patient with diabetes treated with oral antidiabetics, with a history of recurrent renal lithiasis and nephritic colic, and with a malignant neoplasm of the neck treated by RT two months earlier, who presented with a tenuous bladder syndrome
Two days before he was in the emergency room where he was diagnosed with UTI, and antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was started without improvement.
The physical examination showed an axillary temperature of 38.2o C. The rest of the examination was completely normal, including the rectal examination that showed a prostate size III/IV, not indurated and slightly painful to the surrounding area.
In the blood analysis performed, it was noteworthy that there was an important leukocytosis of 41800 with neutrophilia (93%), a blood glucose of 337 mg/dl, a platelet count of 394000, a fibrinogen index of 771 and a lack of platelets.
Pyuria and microhematuria were found in the urine sediment, and no pathology appeared in the simple chest and abdomen X-rays performed.
Urgency catheter was also inserted in an abdominal ultrasound that showed no pathology.
With the suspicion of UTI, she was admitted to the Urology Department and intravenous antibiotic treatment was instituted after obtaining an urinocultive.
The chosen regimen in this case was the combination of ceftriaxone 1 g plus tobramycin 100 mg every 12 hours.
On the third day of admission and due to the clinical and analytical improvement of the patient, it was decided to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, continuing with cefuroxime-axilla.
On the seventh day, and▁coinciding with the arrival of the hemocultives and urinocultives enrolled at admission and who were informed as negative, the patient presented a fever peak of 39° C. and a new elevation of leukocytes.
We decided to restart intravenous antibiotic therapy and perform a v-prostatic ultrasound scan in which the great prostate stood out (400 cc.)
the patient presented.
The suspicion of acute prostatitis in the context of BPH is raised.
it was decided to continue with the intravenous antibiotic therapy and schedule a Millin type Adectomy when the infectious clinic was referred.
Despite antibiotic therapy, the evolution continued to be unfavorable, the fever peaks persisted, so the treatment regimen was changed introducing intravenous levofloxacin.
instead of ceftriaxone, urine culture was requested.
Despite the change in antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to present fever and worsening of the general condition, so it was decided to perform a transrectal ultrasound to rule out the presence of any complication, in which a poorly defined area appeared in the right doechoic lobe and heterogeneous abscess.
Pathological findings were consistent with a transrectal ultrasound guided puncture of the abscess, obtaining approximately 20 ml.
purulent material sent to microbiology.
Prostate and pus▁exudate cultures were positive for E. coli.
Despite the puncture, the patient continued with septic symptoms and did not report any improvement. A CT was performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out abscess complications.
On CT, an increase in the size of the prostatic gland appeared with a multilayered liquid collection located caudally to the gland.
Because CT findings failed transrectal puncture, a transvesical prostatectomy was performed.
After opening the capsule, we could▁appreciate the total destructuring of the gland, with the presence of multiloculation and purulent material inside, as well as extensive areas of apical prostatic necrosis that compromised the tissue urethra.
Pathological anatomy showed two small foci of microac adenocarcinoma, very distant from the resection limits, with Gleason 2 + 3 and acute prostatitis and hyperplasia complicated with large nodular necrosis areas
The postoperative course was satisfactory, with a rapid clinical and laboratory improvement, progressing to hospital discharge 21 days after the intervention.
Fifteen days after discharge, the patient was seen in our outpatient clinic with stress urinary incontinence.
Six months after the intervention, the patient continues to have mild-moderate incontinence and needs absorbents for daily hygiene.
