PA: conserved vesicular murmur.
ABD: blade without masses or enlargement.
On the left lower extremity, the patient presented with a mild oedema to the knee.
Hypopigmented plaques in the pretibial region, vesicular lesions on the foot.
Macular lesions located in the right knee were hypervascularized.
▁Complementary tests'Analytical: anodine except PCR: 56.80 mg/l (less than 5).
RPR-, IgG toxo+, IgG CMV+, anti-HCV-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+, HBsAg-, anti-HAV+.
In addition, brucellosis, cryptia, Treponema, Bartonella and Plasmodium falciparum were ruled out.
»With HIV positive 375 CD4 and 41,000 viral load.
No mutations were detected in the transcriptase inhibitors.
» Chest radiography: interstitial infiltrates predominantly in the upper and posterior lobes, mainly in the form of atelectasis in LSI.
» Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb showed extensive thrombus in the common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein and left popliteal vein.
Complete coagulation study with no relevant findings.
»Sputum x 3: Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated.
»TC: lung with multiple diffuse foci of pseudonodu consolidations bilateral cavitated or cavitated, predominantly in the upper lobes and upper segments of the lower lobes.
Multiple reactive bilateral hiliar lymph nodes in subcarinal space.
«Skin biopsy of the nose and of the mouth: a proliferation of fusiform cells with atypia and mitosis, together with vascular cleft and extravasation, is observed at the level of the dermis.
They show immunoexpression for HHV-8.
Diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.
Stage C2 diagnosis of HIV
(375 CD4 and 41000 CV); HLA B5701 negative MAR.
RPR-, IgG toxo+, IgG CMV+, anti-HCV-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+, HBsAg-, anti-HAV+.
raltegravir (RAL), tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC).
«Tuberculosis pulmonary»
» Kaposi's sarcoma, stage IV.
» Common, superficial and inferior deep femoral venous thrombosis and popliteal thrombosis.
Treatment The patient was admitted in isolation and started treatment with etambuco, rifampicin and pyrazinamide.
Antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir was initiated two weeks later (the latter two due to its interaction with rifampicin, the enzyme which metabolizes cytochrome P450 drugs).
Due to the possible interactions and in anticipation of cancer treatment initiation, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is left. Start 7/10/16 palliative cancer treatment with the pegylated Adria scheme (sic) until 7/2017 cycles (sic).
She had to be treated several times for neutropenia G3.
The patients response after 7 cycles of treatment was almost complete in all lesions. The most important improvement in the level of the nose injury despite the delays is noteworthy.
Currently, aesthetic surgery of the lesion at the nasal level is pending to be evaluated by a specialist.
In addition, the patient developed neutropenia G:3 which led to the development of multiple doses of filgrastim, requiring support.
He performs good compliance with antiretroviral therapy.
