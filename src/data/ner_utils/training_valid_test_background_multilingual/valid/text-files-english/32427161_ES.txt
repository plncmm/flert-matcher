A 14-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, came to our institution with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for 3 days, but without respiratory symptoms.
The patient's mother reported mild respiratory symptoms 3 weeks earlier, but the patient had not undergone any SARS-CoV-2 test.
On admission (day -2), the patient had fever (38.1 °C) and was stable cardiovascularly; showed no signs of respiratory distress.
The abdomen was tense, with defense in the right upper and lower quadrants.
Initial analyses revealed▁lymphocytic colitis (0.14 x 109 cells per L [range: 1.5-7.6]), a significant increase in C-reactive protein (242 mg/L [normal range: 30 cells) and sterile pyuria.
Symptomatic treatment with piperacillin-tapharyngeal mask for premedication with acute CMV infection was initiated, and nasopharyngeal smears were sent for testing for MRSA-CoV-2 by PCR.
Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal.
Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient developed dyspnea, cough, and an increasing need for oxygen (8 L/min), until he needed continuous positive mechanical ventilation.
The patient had a more sick and less interacted aspect, presented a maculopapular pale rash and boluses were administered due to persistent tachycardia.
Chest CT showed typical results of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
A diagnosis of possible COVID-19 was determined.
Secondary multiorgan inflammation or cytokine crisis, based on clinical symptoms,▁lymphocytic seizures interval [4 mmol/ l]), thrombocytopenia, acute phase increased (mean [44.2 IU/ dl]), normal liver glycoprotein [30 mmol/ l])
The antinuclear antibody test was negative.
Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin IgG 25.5U/mL [normal range < 20] and anti-β2-glucoprotein IgG 28.8U/mL [normal range < 20]) were positive serum complement g.
In addition, the patient developed mild polyarticular arthritis of the small hands.
No cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis or mucosal alterations suggestive of classic or complete Kaaki disease were observed.
The patient was not eligible for compassionate use of remdesivir because the PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative.
As the patient showed clinical characteristics that indicated a cytokine crisis associated with COVID-19, a recombinant anticholinergic treatment was initiated (anakinra receptor) after a multidisciplinary analysis.
Anakinra was started at 4 mg/kg per day (100 mg twice daily) subcutaneously and increased to 8 mg/kg per day (200 mg twice daily) after an increase in blood lactate concentration to 36 h, because the patient required an increase in serum
The LV systolic border was observed, as well as enzyme leakage (troponin T 45 ng/L), aortic regurgitation and progressive left coronary dilation. Aspirin (2 mg/kg) was started due to its anti-septic effects.
In relation to the time of treatment with anakinra, the patient's respiratory status became stable and the clinical and analytical values returned to normal, except for coronary dilation which persisted at the time of discharge.
A progressive anakinra tapering regimen was established and was withdrawn within 6 days.
Subsequently, serological tests were positive for IgG of SARS-CoV-2 (limitis on day 6, positive on day 11).
PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from three nasopharyngeal samples (days 3, 5, and 7) and feces (day 11) were negative.
