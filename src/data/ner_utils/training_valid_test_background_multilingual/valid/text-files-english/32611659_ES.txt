In April 2020, a 57-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with fever and cough non-contrast for 8 days.
Six days before admission, the patient came to the bedside physician.
The patient had been positive for influenza from a nasopharyngeal swab test.
She was prescribed laninamivir, but her symptoms did not improve.
Two days before admission, the patient was referred to our hospital because of persistent fever.
An anteroposterior chest X-ray found ground glass opacities in the left lung and was treated with garenoxacin.
Later, real-time RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
His medical history indicated vasospastic angina and diabetes mellitus.
Her medication consisted of mygloitol and myglitol.
He worked in the customer service of a restaurant.
He had no history of smoking, traveling or contact with sick people.
On admission, the patient reported dyspnea, anosmia and ageism.
Vital signs were as follows: temperature 38.8 °C; blood pressure 131/74 mm Hg; pulse 80 l.p.m.
; respiratory rate 20 r.p.m.
; oxygen saturation 91% in ambient air with desaturation at minimum effort.
Complete blood count showed a leukocyte count of 8.3×109/L (neutrophils, 86%; lymphocytes, 8%; monocytes, 6%); hemoglobin 144 g/L; mean globular volume, 199×109/L; thrombocytes
The following serological results were obtained: total protein, 6.5 g/dL; albumin, 3.1 g/dL; bilirubin toral, 0.6 mg/dL; creatinine, 11 mg/aminotransferase, 0.16 mg/dL; protein, 14.6 mg/dL
Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B virus antibodies were negative.
An ECG was normal.
An anteroposterior chest X-ray revealed consolidation in the left lung.
A subsequent thoracic CT scan revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities with consolidation and visible intralobular lines (film pattern).
Sputum cultures for bacteria, bacilli acid alcohol resistant were all negative.
The initial considerations for this patient who presented an acute picture with fever and cough were infection with a common virus (rinovirus, non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and influenza) as well as community acquired pneumonia.
The rapid antigen test and its clinical evolution gave weight to the possibility of pneumonia.
Due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan, it was also necessary to consider the possibility of COVID-19.
Treatment was initiated with a cyclesonide inhaler (200 μg twice a day for 14 days), a broad-spectrum antiretroviral (1800 mg twice a day for the first day, followed by 800 mg twice a day for the first symptom).
Shortly after hospitalization, the patient developed progressive hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 91% with nasal cannula at 2 L/min).
The fever continued during the first 4 days of hospitalization, but then returned.
On day 7 of hospitalization, dyspnea and hypoxemia improved.
According to the discharge criteria for confirmed cases of IDWCO in Japan (2 negative tests of rRT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs with an interval of 24 hours and clinical improvement of signs and symptoms), the patient was admitted 4 weeks later
