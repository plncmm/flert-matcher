Fifteen patients were selected according to their preferences: Pteronyssinus, Alternaria, Cat, Dog, Olivo, Salsola and Gramineae.
After signing the informed consent, skin tests were performed in them at the end (in dilutions to the tenth of the mother extract).
Skin tests of the different dissolutions of the mother extract provided by each laboratory were performed on each patient: 1/100; 1/10, 1/1 and compared with the results obtained with histamine and with the cutaneous extracts for commercial tests.
