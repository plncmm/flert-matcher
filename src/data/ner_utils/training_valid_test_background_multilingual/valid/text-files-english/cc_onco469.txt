Anamnesis Personal history A 51-year-old man with no relevant medical or surgical history.
EC 0.
She does not receive chronic treatment.
Adequate socio-family support.
▁Oncological history Diagnosticated in April 2018 (50 years) of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma (8th edition AJJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 2017), PD-L1 60 %, without evidence of ALK-1 molecular alterations in EROS
First-line treatment with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) was started, achieving partial response after the fourth cycle.
He received a total of 10 cycles until December 2018, maintaining response.
Current history In January 2019, after the 11th cycle, she consulted in the Emergency Department due to fever, without clinical signs of infectious focus.
Laboratory tests revealed mild renal failure (creatinine 1.60 mg/dl).
Complicated infection (obstructive urinary tract function) was ruled out and when mild initial improvement was observed with parenteral hydration, given the suspicion of lower urinary tract infection with associated prerenal failure, a wide ambulatory management was decided.
Subsequently, she received 2 additional cycles of pembrolizumab.
Then the febricula reappeared and, in March 2019, she went back to the Emergency Department, in this case due to a fever peak of up to 38oC.
He also had acute left knee pain with inflammatory characteristics and polyuria (estimated diuresis of approximately 3 l urine) in the previous weekdays, with no clear nocturnal predominance or evident pharmacological cause.
Physical examination revealed fever (38oC).
Signs of mucocutaneous fistula and monoarthritis of the left knee stood out, with marked inflammation and functional impotence.
▁Complementary tests Severe renal analytical (creatinine 2.60 mg/dl without response to fluid or obstruction data (abdominal ultrasound); together with hyperchloremic 7.110 lower limit of potassium chloride/HgpH; PK3 - 7.519).
Urine study confirmed polyuria (urinary volume 24 hours: 4.5 l) and showed inadequate acid-base and ionic compensation (urinary pH > 6.5; urinary anion GAP asthmus 22), as well as leukocyturia.
The study of the renin-angiotensin aldosterona axis revealed hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism (aldosterona aldosterona 336 pg/ml; renin activity 22.8 ng/ml/ml).
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out.
Overall, the findings were consistent with acute▁tubulointerstitial nephritis and proximal renal tubular acidosis/type II.
The study of synovial fluid extracted from the inflamed joint (left knee) showed a very marked inflammatory pattern (opaque aspect, decreased philany, consumption of glucose, increased proteins, leukocytes 50,000/ul).
Microcrystalline and infectious arthritis was ruled out.
The hemogram showed normocytic-normochromic anemia (inflammatory) and leukocytosis with neutrophilia and absolute monocytosis, as well as reactive thrombocytosis.
Acute phase reactants (PCR, ESR) were high.
The autoimmunity study performed later showed high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (1/160), as well as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CP) values greater than 25ml).
Serological criteria were compatible with rheumatoid arthritis.
Since both complications were of immune-mediated mechanism (causes were ruled out: infectious, pharmacological), time-consequence anticholinergics common and kept unequivocal with pembrolizumab, they were attributed to the antibody PD-1.
Diagnosis Acute▁tubulointerstitial nephritis, proximal renal tubular acidosis/type II and inflammatory monoarthritis with serological criteria for rheumatoid arthritis secondary to pembrolizumab.
Treatment Systemic corticosteroids were initiated at high doses (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day), along with electrolyte and▁vigorous acid-base support to restore renal fluid loss mEq/kg, potassium and nephrotoxic joint pain (> 1 day).
The evolution was favorable during the first days of treatment.
Analytically, the onset of recovery of creatinine clearance was observed, as well as a significant decrease in parenteral bicarbonate and potassium requirements, until reaching levels that allowed the change to oral supplementation.
There was also normalization of blood count and a generalized decrease in all inflammatory markers.
Clinically, the patient became afflicted with remission of goitre disease.
Because of substantial improvement, follow-up was continued on an outpatient basis, with a slowly progressive decrease in corticosteroid dose and continuous improvement in laboratory parameters.
Coinciding with a decrease in the corticosteroid dose (prednisone < 10 mg/day), another episode of severe metabolic acidosis that required a new hospital admission was reported.
At this point, it was decided not to restart treatment with pembrolizumab definitively, given the unresolved grade 2 immune-mediated toxicity.
In its last reassessment in June 2019, in treatment with low doses of corticoids (prednisone 10 mg/day), the patient presented an adequate creatinine around serum levels alement ydl, a higher pH bicarbonate and potassium.
▁Oncologic disease is still in a partially sustained response situation without requiring the start of a second line of treatment.
