A 31-year-old woman, otherwise healthy, came to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, myalgia, vomiting and colic, of five days duration.
He worked in a factory, but had not been exposed to symptomatic contacts, was not a smoker, drinker or used illegal substances.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure 97/73 mmHg, pulse 127 l.p.m., respiratory rate 18 r.p.m.
Cluster was present in 95% of patients with hypersensitivity reactions and persistent fever despite acetaminophen administration.
On physical examination, the patient was ill, uncomfortable, and with intense discomfort.
Initial tests revealed hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia.
Symptomatic treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone and hydration was instituted iv.
A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for COVID-19.
Hypoxia and fever worsened, with an increasing demand for oxygen, which caused hypotension and tachypnea; the patient required intubation and sedation and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).
A chest CT scan yielded consistent results with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and severe oxygen fraction (FiO2) lowering to 77.5, consistent with ARDS
Tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 were positive.
Treatment was initiated with a hydroxychloroquine regimen and optimized for assisted respiration to protect the lungs.
The initial tests of COVID-19 indicated cytokine crises, while a high A-a gradient associated with an imbalance V/Q was consistent with the L phenotype of COVID-19.
A brief course of anticoagulants was given.
The patient was placed in prone position for intermittent cessation to improve ̄s alignment with the ventilator.
In daily wakefulness tests, the patient showed clear signs of disorientation and encephalopathy.
During saturation and removal of the paralysis, a new flaccidity of the left hand was observed.
The result was subtle and could not be evaluated according to the NIH neurological assessment scale because of the patient's inability to follow orders.
However, the brainstem reflexes were maintained, with photomotor reflex and cough reflex spontaneous breathing capacity and response to pain.
The delays in obtaining an urgent Cranial TAC were caused by its positive COVID-19 and a equivocal picture of pseudoictus.
After appropriate precautions have been established, the CT result was irrelevant for bleeding or acute or subacute infarction.
Treatment with atorvastatin and aspirin was initiated for secondary prevention while COVID-19 tests were repeated to determine the evolution of the disease.
A second CT scan revealed ischemic changes in the region irrigated by the right middle cerebral artery, consistent with a cortical stroke.
A follow-up echocardiogram and a hypercoagulability analysis were negative, as well as ultrasound scans of the upper and lower extremities to look for sources of thrombi for deep venous thrombosis.
After being on assisted breathing and nasogastric feeding for a long time, a cholecystectomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube were performed.
During the following days, improvements were observed in her mental activity, with openness and eye tracking, and the ability to start following orders.
Physiotherapy evaluations showed low mobility scores and severe disability, as well as periods of disorientation.
Overall, it continued to improve, with the ability to▁tolerate breath tests and follow orders.
After determining a poor prognosis, she was discharged for transfer to a rehabilitation center.
