A 42-year-old woman with fever and dry cough for two days came to her bedside doctor.
She had a history of contact with another person with similar symptoms, but had no predisposing conditions.
On physical examination, no abnormalities were found; the temperature was 38 °C and the rest of vital signs were normal.
Oxygen saturation was 98%.
Analytical and diagnostic imaging tests were requested.
The tests revealed high lactate dehydrogenase (648 units/litre (U/L), normal: 140–280U/L), C-reactive protein (52 milligrams/L), normal white blood cell count 260/L
Serological tests for rheumatoid antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, smooth muscle antibodies and antimitochondral antibodies were negative, as well as antibodies of the hepatitis C surface antigen and of the hepatitis C virus were negative.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the clinical results, a nasopharyngeal smear test was performed and nucleic acid of coronavirus 2 of acute respiratory distress syndrome was detected by RT-PCR.
Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours.
After two days, the patient developed maculopapular erythematous rash prpela ulcers that began in the upper extremities as well as blisters in the entire body.
She had genital mucosal involvement, but the patient did not allow us to take images.
Nikolski's sign was positive.
Finally, Stevens-Johnson syndrome was diagnosed.
Due to the probabilities of a pharmacological reaction, hydroxychloroquine was interposed and treatment for COVID-19 was switched to lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg twice daily in the hospital.
10 mg loratadine twice daily and 50 mg diphenhydramine three times daily were also administered.
The patient was discharged five days later, with non-pruritic exfoliative dermatoses at the distal end of the upper limbs.
