No plantar lesions or other findings.
▁Complementary tests - Analytical: CBC that was abnormal.
A slightly elevated glomerular sedimentation rate (GEV): 14
Normal coagulation.
Biochemistry: glucose, renal function, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, FA, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulins, complement, CRP, RF and proteinogram within normal limits.
Antiphospholipid antibodies negative, ANA and antiDNA negative.
• Mantoux negative.
Chest X-ray: anodyne.
· TAC Thorax: Nonspecific, high density millimeter nodule in the left lower lobe, compatible with granuloma.
 ANCA negative, colage, ASLO negative was discarded.
 Spirometry with FEV1: 77%; FVC: 78%; IT: 0.81.
 Pathological anatomy (biopsy of the lesion): Upper dermis edema with dense inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils polymorphonuclear cells) suggestive of the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome and ruling out primary cutaneous lymphoma
Differential diagnosis in Emergency Department and/or Internal Medicine consultation with neutrophilic pathology service: Skin infection (fungal and mycobacteria), Nonreactive pyoderma diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis, primary cutaneous Kaposis sarcoma remission (PC).
After the underlying malignancy screening, immunosuppression was initiated with systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone 5 mg/24 h oral initially, which was increased in the absence of improvement to 25 mg/24 h oral subsequently administered (25 mg/24 h oral).
After months, the patient's clinical evolution of these lesions with ulceration and added to the treatment with colchicine (2 mg oral h) and a 2-week mild improvement of the treatment with oral colchicine (100 mg/24 h).
Later, colchicine had to be withdrawn due to intolerance of the patient, with corticoid therapy (prednisone 25 mg/24h, oral).
After a review of the biopsy by the minimal malignancy of the day, confirming the diagnosis of SS, the patient was treated with▁cyclosporine A dose of prednisone at a dose of 3.5mg/kg/day, while starting a descending course of corticoids.
After 10 weeks of treatment, the patient had excellent renal function and drug tolerance.
Currently, the dose is maintained and there are no active lesions since week 3 of this therapy, with a clear improvement since week 5.
