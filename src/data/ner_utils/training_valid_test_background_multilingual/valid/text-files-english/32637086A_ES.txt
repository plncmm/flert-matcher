A 46-year-old man presented with mild cough and fever for 4 days.
She had a history of hypertension and contact with suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2.
The clinical examination and vital signs were normal except for febricula (temperature: 38.2 C).
The chest X-ray was normal.
Pathological tests showed‚ñÅlymphocytic proliferation and a high sedimentation rate (58).
A RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal smear was positive for SARS-CoV-2; serum ferritin was 746 ng/ml.
The patient was admitted to the coronavirus isolation unit.
Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice a day) and zinc (500 mg daily) were administered.
The patient's condition worsened and on the second day he presented dyspnea (respiratory rate: 35 r.p.m), oxygen saturation was 80% and environmental temperature was 39.5C2/ PaO2: 57 mmHg, air saturation was 114 mmHg.
The chest X-ray showed ground glass opacities in the right upper zone, with a small area of consolidation.
A CT scan showed small subpleural ground glass opacities affecting both lower lobes and the right upper lobe.
Non-invasive therapy was administered to every patient 4000 and one vial of meronepem (1 g three vecs a day), hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice a day) and Kaletra tablets (lopinavir/200 IU).
After 3 days, the patient did not respond to treatment and worsened even further.
Dyspnea increased (oxygen saturation 60% without O2, which increased to 90% with 10 L O2 with nasal cannula), diffuse bilateral subcrepitants were observed PaO2/ml with normal PaCO2 PaO2/ml with normal serum ferritin / PaCO2 96
A CT scan showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and various areas of consolidation in different regions of the entire lung.
Despite treatment, the patient received 200 ml of serum convalescent of a patient recovered from moderate COVID-19 after performing the necessary tests of donor plasma (hemoglobinemia and viral tests).
The patient began to improve clinically; 4 days later, he was quite stable, with no dyspnea, oxygen saturation in ambient air reached 95%, and chest X-ray showed partial resolution of the lesions.
The patient was discharged from the hospital 16 days after admission, in good health status and without symptoms; chest examination was normal, chest X-ray did not show relevant results, and three consecutive tests were negative RT-PCR 24 hours after admission.
