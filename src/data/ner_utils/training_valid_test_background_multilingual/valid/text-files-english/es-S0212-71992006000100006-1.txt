An 18-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with severe headache and fever due to lack of improvement with conventional treatment of viral upper respiratory infections.
Among the personal history, only infectious mononucleosis stands out.
After a catarrhal episode of one week of evolution, with general▁malaise, dry cough and fever (up to 38.5 °C), the patient develops global headache, more intense in the frontal region, in the last 48 hours, initially without rhinorrhea.
Isolatedly, he presented minimal purulent nasal secretion that has been bloody in the last few days.
You have not had loss of consciousness, seizures, thiram, or chills.
On physical examination, we found: Ta: 37.5 oC; TA: 137/73 mmHg; P: 71 bpm.
Good general appearance with proper hydration and mucocutaneous perfusion.
She's not impressive about being affected.
Febrile faces.
No painful spots in the percussion of the sinuses
Cutaneously, it presents with a maculous rash and erythematous neck that affects the trunk and neck.
Laterocervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathies are not present.
Cardiac auscultation revealed hypersensitivity with no murmurs.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed a conserved vesicular murmur, with no presence of roncus, crackles or wheezing.
The abdomen is blunt, depressible and does not have masses or enlargement.
The upper and lower extremities do not present pathological data, with distal pulses present.
The neurological examination is strictly normal, with no data on focality or meningism.
▁Complementary examinations were performed, with a rigorously normal chest X-ray, non-pathological urine analysis and blood count, highlighting leukocytosis with the presence of young sinuses (falling: 0.3dl) and differential diagnosis of meningitis.
At the same time, a radiographic study of the paranasal sinuses showed no data compatible with sinusitis; then, to rule out complications (such as thrombosis of the left cranial sinus or related encephalitis), a CT scan was performed.
Once confirmed in the diagnosis of sinusitis in the cephalosporin, we decided to admit the patient to the hospital for a correct follow-up and start intravenous antibiotic treatment with third generation antibiotics, treatment with the headache evolving 48 hours asymptomatic.
