ANESTHETIC ANTECTION IN THE CURRENT DISEASE AND EXPLORTS Male, 68 years old, with a history of hypertension, ex-smoker, chronic bronchitis and tuberculosis
She underwent surgery two years before epigastric hernia and gastric volvulus and one year before abdominal incisional hernia.
Two months before she was admitted to Cardiology with a diagnosis of possible idiopathic acute pericarditis, and a recurrence of a gastroesophageal hernia was discovered incidentally.
As usual treatment, she takes dutasteride 0.5 mg/24h, tamsulosin 0.4/24h, olmesartan 4/12h, salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 mg/24h, diltbuzem,
She was admitted for surgery to correct paraesophageal hernia with reduction of herniated stomach, closure of scheduled diaphragmatic▁pillars, Nissen fundoplication and gastropexy.
In the days after surgery the patient complained of chest pain radiating to the shoulder with dyspnea and dysphagia accompanying, without apparent cause.
On the eighth postoperative day, the patient presented significant deterioration of general status, with marked hypotension, chest pain and severe dyspnea, so the cardiology team of the daycare center was informed.
Physical examination revealed hypotension 90 mmHg, tachycardia (120 bpm), marked IY at 45o, cardiac tones apagated, crackles at the lung bases, subcutaneous emphysematous, and right lower limb edema.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES ECG: sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm.
Axis -30o, BIRDHH.
Elevation of diffuse TS with decrease in AVR, decrease in PR with increase in AVR (compatible with acute pericarditis).
Chest radiography: significant cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion Analytical: 110, Cr 1.78, normal urea, platelet count > 9 mg/dl, Hb 10.4, leukocytosis (15300/ul, neutrophilia 88%),
Normal coagulation.
Markers of myocardial damage were negative.
Cholesterols normal.
Normal iron.
Normal thyroids.
Urgent echocardiogram: circumferential pericardial effusion, 30 mm, collapse of right cavities and tendency to collapse of the left ventricle, alternation of valve flows with breathing, compatible with echocardiographic taping.
EVOLUTION of vancomycin is administered in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit where percutaneous pericardiocentesis is performed with abundant purulent fluid, sending the corresponding samples for biochemical and microbiological analysis and broad spectrum of empirical antibiotic treatment.
Given the recent history of gastrointestinal surgery, a relationship with the current process is suspected. A chest CT is requested to rule out the presence of digestive-peristal fistulas.
TAC: air-fluid level in severe pericardial effusion of about 3 cm circumferential.
After oral contrast administration, no data suggesting the presence of gastrointestinal-pericardium fistula were observed.
Periodontitis bacterial, pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema.
Pericardial fluid culture: purulent fluid with abundant PMN, growth of several microorganisms: Str beta hemolytic group F, Str Viridans, BGP aerobic, BGN.
Mycobacterium cultures were negative.
Antibiogram: sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, resistant to vancomycin.
Control echocardiogram: data on pericardium constriction, parallel movement of both leaves pericardium and thickening.
Although initially after percutaneous pericardiocentesis it improves significantly, then it is observed that the pericardial effusion increases progressively and signs and symptoms of heart failure persist, so subxiphoid pericardiotomy of purulent fluid draining 200 cfu is performed.
Pathological anatomy: chronic fibrotic pericarditis with internal surface necrosis and purulent.
Pathologic fibrosis and associated colitis.
Improvement of the clinical situation of left epicardial abscess but in the echocardiograms increase of the pericardial effusion in the lateral face progressive increase is performed by cardiac surgery and removal of the pericardium by drainage intercardiectomy
Pericardial capsule was negative.
They were negative, a result that indicates minimum probability of infection by M. tuberculosis.
The patient completed several weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment (synthetic: meropenem 1 g/8h, 3 weeks + vancomycin 1 day and later: imipenem 0.5 g/8h + amikacin 800 mg/24h).
Good evolution and progressive improvement.
In total, more than two months were admitted.
Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and has an active life.
Control echocardiograms completely revealed pericardial effusion.
Relapsing paraesophageal hernia DIAGNOSIS underwent Nissen type surgery.
Acute purulent pericarditis, severe pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
Epileptic efusive-constrictive.
Defecation and diagnostic pericardiocentesis.
Subxiphoid pericardiotomy.
Pericardiectomy and drainage of pericardial abscess.
