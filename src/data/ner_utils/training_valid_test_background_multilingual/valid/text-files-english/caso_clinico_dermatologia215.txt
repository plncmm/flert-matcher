Anamnesis A 71-year-old woman, diagnosed with psoriatic arthropathy, was treated for a month and a half prior to admission with flu.
He was admitted for presenting fever, asthenia and odynophagia of one week of evolution accompanied by a skin rash for two days, pruritic and predominantly on the trunk.
Physical examination (90/60 mmHg A confluent mapapular exanthema of morbidlyform appearance was observed, with erythema and scaling that compromised more than 90% of the body surface, as well as fever and thermometered hypotension 38.5oC).
The oral mucosa showed whitish plaques that were easily detached.
The pharynx was hyperemic without▁exudate or hypertrophy.
No cervical lymphadenopathy was detected.
▁Complementary leukocytes (17600/μL) and thrombocytopenia (61000/μL) were observed during admission in the analytical study.
Elevation of liver function tests (GOT 1700 U/L, GPT 1400 U/L, GGT 1137 U/L) was observed.
Serology was positive for HSV-6 IgM and all other determinations were negative.
Blood cultures were positive for E. Coli.
Non-pelvic inguinal CT scan showed subcentimetric lymphadenopathies at the level of the gastrohepatic ligament and hepatic hilium, root of the menentery and bilateral paracecal lymph nodes.
Biopsy showed an orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with▁patches of parakeratosis on an epidermis permeated by abundant lymphocytes, necrotic▁keratinocytes and basal vacuolar degeneration.
A polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the superficial dermis, composed mainly of lymphocytes of different size, slightly large with irregular nuclei, some hyperchromia, slightly atypical.
Diagnose DRESS syndrome due to fluid embolism.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for one month and received treatment with corticosteroids. During treatment, neither hypotension nor cutaneous lesions returned completely despite cessation of treatment.
After the initial diagnosis of "E. coli bacteremia", ceftriaxone was administered with resolution.
Fluconazole was also administered for the treatment of her oral muguet with satisfactory resolution.
During admission, a call for signs and symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis was observed, which resolved partially with steroid treatment.
