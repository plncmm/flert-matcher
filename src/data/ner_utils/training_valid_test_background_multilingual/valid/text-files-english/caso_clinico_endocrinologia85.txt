An 18-month-old girl presented to the hospital with seizures, muscle hypotonia with suspected encephalitis.
Analytical analysis highlighted hypoglycemia (19mg/dl) in the bladder and metabolic acidosis with elevated anion GAP.
A study of hypoglycemia in children was carried out with the following statement: Excretion of very enhanced metabolites of free le, decreased levels of carnitine and normal total and esterified carnitine.
A diagnosis of aciduria 3 Methylglutaric OH was made, which was confirmed by skin biopsy.
The symptoms of 3OH methylglutaric aciduria usually occur in the first 2 years of life and consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle hypotonia, decreased level of consciousness.
Hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis (due to accumulation of metabolites) occur during crises and are triggered by infections, prolonged fasting or infections.
Treatment is initiated with a low-protein diet, high-biological value amino acid supplementation with low carnitine, and it is indicated to avoid prolonged fasting.
Gastroenteritis in the patient presents a good evolution, with only one admission due to hypoglycemia associated with a rotavirus infection.
In the follow-up a genetic study was performed: probably pathogenic variant in apparent homozygosis: c.575t>C (p.Phe192Ser) in the cardinal insulin-associated gene 21 years after onset
Laboratory tests showed C-peptide:0.54ng/ ml, Ac.
Antidiabetic agent.
Syncope Seizure Transient ischaemic attack (AIS2)
anti Glutamate decarboxylase, GAD65 >250 IU/ml U/mL.
Currently, the patient has good metabolic control with 6.1% glycosylated hemoglobin. The association of both diseases is not previously described in the literature. We are faced with a patient with type 1 DM who cannot have the enzyme metabolic loop deficiency.
