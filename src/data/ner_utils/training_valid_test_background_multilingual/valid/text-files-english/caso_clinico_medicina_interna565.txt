Anamnesis A 17-year-old male with a history of tension-type headache.
He was a student of Maghrebian origin without travel outside Spain for years; he denied sexual relations or other epidemiological data of interest.
He reported left lumbar pain radiating to the anterior thigh that was on the vertex for two weeks.
She suffered sudden worsening of her pain, weakness of her lower limbs and temperature of 39oC.
Cephalea nonspecific; without genital hypoesthesia, gluea or lower limbs.
There was no sphincteric alteration or other clinical manifestations.
Cardiorespiratory failure and abdominal pain were normal.
Two incarnate nails in the feet of years of evolution with adjacent erythema and pain, without suppuration.
Neurological condition with motor weakness counter-resistance in the left lower limb due to pain on mobilization; gait with base enlargement.
No alterations.
Homolateral positive Lasgue and Bragard maneuvers.
Location of the left lobe: slightly hyperexalted cutaneous-plantar flexor reflexes.
No meningeal signs, normal cranial nerves.
Neurological examination was unremarkable.
Pathogenic leukocytes and neutrophils were prominent in peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP) 311 mg/l, procalcitonin ( PCT) 0.13 ng/ml and 26,000 leukocytes to neutrophils (PMN).
Chest X-ray was normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacra spine ruled out spondylodyscitis, epidural abscess and compression of the medullary canal by another cause; left sacroiliac joint swelling was evident with extensive involvement of the sacrum.
Therefore, empirical antibiotic therapy with Linezolid and Ceftriaxone was initiated.
Diagnosis, Differentiated Sacroileitis.
- Bacterial infection is the most common cause (Brucella, Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomona Aeruginosa, Streptococcus Salmonella, Klebsiella spp).
- Ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, microcrystal arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, Behcet
- Paraneoplastic syndromes.
- Isotretinoin.
Hospitalization, Healthcare-Assisted, grew in two of the many hemocultives Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistant (SAMR), its situation and antibiotic therapy due to Daptomycin.
IGRA test for tuberculosis and negative Rose of Bengal.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis.
Reviewing the case, it appeared likely that the origin of the clinical picture was overinfection by poor hygiene of incarnate nails.
The patient had a favorable clinical, laboratory and radiological evolution.
Clinical judgement Left-sided Sacroileitis due to Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistant of cutaneous origin.
