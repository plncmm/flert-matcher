A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of mental illness and behavioural problems.
Her medical history included allergy to penicillin, dyslipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Prior to the current admission, the patient was under home treatment with intravenous bacteraemia and fever at doses of 1gr/24h, indicated for a severe, streptococcal bacteraemia due to Espinosa multig/24h.
Confusional symptoms started on the 5th day after hospital discharge and treatment with corticosteroids began.
The initial examination revealed a Ta 38.5oC, regular general condition, absent, presence of manierisms, sensory aphasia, and paraphasia with conserved understanding.
The rest of the vital signs and the examination by equipment did not show valuable findings.
Prior to admission there was an autonomous patient with preserved upper functions, with only two episodes of self-limiting disorientation that occurred in relation to the infection.
Upon admission, home treatment with anticholinergics and‚ñÅbenzodiazepines was withdrawn and an extensive aetiological study was completed, ruling out toxic-metabolic causes brain injury, infectious brain injury and basic computed tomography (MRI).
Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn, considering as a possible cause of neurological symptoms in the absence of signs of infection.
The patient presented progressive clinical improvement until resolution of the neurological symptoms on the 5th day after antibiotic withdrawal.
