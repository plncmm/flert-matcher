We report the case of a 33-year-old man who consulted for progressive enlargement of the right testicle of three months duration.
She did not report any urinary symptoms or pain.
There are no allergies or diseases of interest.
She had normal psychomotor development without a history of cryptorchidism or hydrocele during childhood.
She denied alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
Physical examination revealed a diffuse increase in size and consistency of the right testicle with negative transmissivity.
The left testicle was normal.
Not known: inguinal lymphadenopathy or other anatomy.
There is no gynecomastia, visceromegaly or peritoneal irritation.
We decided to perform testicular ultrasound in Primary Care, observing a diffuse alteration of the echostructure without the presence of cysts or calcifications.
We requested a complete blood test with tumor markers, chest X-ray and referred preferentially to the Urology Department.
Both the complete blood count and the basic biochemistry were strictly normal, as well as the AFP, Beta-HCG and LDH.
The chest X-ray was equally normal.
Given the delay in the waiting time for the Urology consultation, we refer the patient to Hospital Emergency with a complete study conducted in Primary Care.
Testicular ultrasound was performed, confirming: "A enlarged right testis with diffuse alteration of echogenicity, without calcifications, presents diffuse increase of vascularization.
Inflammatory process of the right orchitis type, however, given the time of evolution, a neoplasic process is not discarded".
She was admitted to the Urology Department and underwent right inguinal radical orchiectomy.
Pathological anatomy reports: "Cclassical tumor with a diameter greater than 8 cm, without evidence of insanity of the tunica albugínea.
Testicular parenchyma remnants with intratubular germ cell tumor foci.
Epididymis and resection of the cord are persistent edge without evidence of malignancy".
Computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was staged as follows: "No mediastinal lymphadenopathy, significant axillary hiliar-rsized lymph nodes or lymph nodes were observed.
▁Right paracardiac adenopathy of 6 mm and micronodule of 4 mm in▁SCI.
No pathological retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy was observed.
Findings consistent with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and panoramic radiographs secondary to surgery are observed.
Study challenge without findings".
The decision was made to perform adjuvant surveillance in cases without a pure diagnosis of stage I disease.
However, the small but clinically significant risk of recurrence supports the need for long-term monitoring and initiation of rescue cisplatin-based radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Because recurrences occur mainly in the first 2 years, follow-up with CT is recommended every 3 months for the first year, every 4 months for the second year and every 6 and 12 months for the following years.
Our patient has been followed for more than 3 years, with no relapse data.
The nonspecific findings present in the first CT scan and tumor markers remain negative to date.
