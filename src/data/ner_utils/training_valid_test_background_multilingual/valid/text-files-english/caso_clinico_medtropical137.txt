Personal history A 26-year-old Spanish woman, with no drug allergies, toxic habits or known previous diseases.
I travelled to Morocco (Tetuán) three years before, with no apparent health problems.
Current disease The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of our Hospital 7 July 2001 due to severe polytrauma after Glasgow 5, right tibia-conminute, left frontal lobe fracture and complex tibial fracture with open fracture.
On days +0, +2 and +3 of admission, the patient required six surgical interventions by the Departments of Traumatology and Maxillofacial Surgery.
The patient presented anemia in transfusion range requiring the administration of concentrated concentrated oral contraceptives (days +0, +1, +3, +5 and +9) in the first ten days of admission, requiring hospitalization.
Two weeks after admission, the patient was discharged.
She then began with repeated agitation episodes, and on day +30 she presented significant worsening of her general condition, with high fever (up to 40oC), tonic-clonic seizure +39 new transfusions, hypotension and anemia (37oC).
Presence of refractory hypotension and hematocrit drop on admission day +44 was performed urgent abdominal CT, in which several images suggestive of splenic hematomas were detected.
Total urgent resection was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was "traumatic splenitis".
After the intervention the patient continued to have fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ceftazidime, cefepime, metronidazole + amoxicillin-clavulanate) + new episodes
Subsequent laboratory tests revealed hyperbilirubinemia (maximum total bilirubin concentration 7.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.8 mg/dL, with subsequent stabilization around coagulation 2 mg/dL), with no significant changes in renal function.
Platelet counts returned to normal after cholecystectomy, until platelet count returned to normal on day 160.
Day +79 developed sudden dyspnea with bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrate (previous chest X-rays had been normal), resolved within 2-3 days with diuretic and inotropic treatment.
Physical examination 30 days after admission revealed mild mental retardation, with little response to stimuli.
Temperature 39oC; TA 100/60 mmHg.
She presented cutaneous stiffness and auscultation revealed a fixed cough without murmurs at 110 bpm; vesicular murmur was conserved, with no excessive noise.
The abdomen was blade, slightly painful diffusely, with no masses or organomegaly.
The extremities did not present edemas and surgical wounds did not show data of superinfection.
blood count; hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL; MCV 88 μm3; hematocrit 24.8%; leukocytes 5400 mEq/μL (83.5 % neutrophils, 11.7% lymphocytes; sodium
Bilirubin and liver enzymes were normal.
Blood tests at 38 days of admission were as follows: hemoglobin 5.9 g/dL; leukocytes 6,000 (82% neutrophils; 11.4% lymphocytes, 4.7% monocytes); platelets 45,000; AST 129 IU/L; ALT 101 IU/L
Normal coagulation study.
Streptococcus epidermis was isolated repeatedly in blood (days +19, +46) and in the maxillary sinus.
Candida spp. were also isolated.
resistant to azoles (in urine after 50 days of admission, and in catheter tip), Escherichia coli (sputum, blood and catheter tip) and Acinetobacter baumanii (sputum and catheter tip).
Diagnostic test Peripheral blood smear was performed to study anemia, in which forms compatible with Plasmodium falciparum were observed.
Clinical case Paludism of probable post-transfusional origin caused by Plasmodium falciparum.
After diagnosis, the patient was treated with quinine hydrochloride (650 mg IV).
doxycillin (100 mg every 12 hours) for 12 days.
After the start of treatment, the patient improved clinically without requiring new transfusions.
However, after this period of treatment, the patient continued to suffer constipation in the thick smear layer (day +125).
Therefore, it was decided to treat the patient with mefloquine (mg tablets).
in one dose and 500 mg vo.
in another), with negative direct parasitological examination (day +137).
The patient was discharged to a physical rehabilitation center where she did not present fever or anemia.
An exhaustive search was carried out by the responsible persons of the Regional Transfusion Center, carrying out epidemiological surveys to 61 of the 64 donors of transfused blood products (66 concentrated epidemiological units of plasma without findings), 17 of them 30.
Serology for Plasmodium sp.
in 64 samples, all negative.
Despite the negativity of this search, the origin of the infection by Plasmodium presented by the patient was attributed to some of the multiple transfusions received.
