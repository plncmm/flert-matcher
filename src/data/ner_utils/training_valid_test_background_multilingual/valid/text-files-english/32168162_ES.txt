A 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital. The main symptoms were fever and cough with a 9-day evolution.
The patient's clinical symptoms did not improve despite anticholinergic treatment.
Physical examination showed fever at a temperature of 38.6 Â°C and the patient had a history of untreated hyperglycemia.
On admission, physical examination revealed pharyngeal congestion and slight bilateral inflammation of the tonsils.
His breathing sounds were thick, without rales.
The other physical and neurological examinations did not provide remarkable data.
With regard to epidemiological information, he had been working in a place situated about hundreds of meters in the shellfish market in Huanan, Wuhan, China.
He went to that market to buy fruit 11 days before his admission.
On the second day of admission, laboratory tests showed low oxygen saturation (60%), normal gas pH (7.446), normal leukocyte count (6.66x109/L), low percentage of neutrophils (6.1 %).
Serum chemistry analysis showed low values of total protein (57.6 g/L) and seroalbumin (27.4 g/L), high values of glycohemoglobin (14.1%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (748 g/L) and interleukin-16 mm/h).
All usual microbiological tests, including viral antibodies, were negative.
Chest X-rays and CT scans showed ground glass opacities and bilateral consolidations in the lungs.
Consequently, based on epidemiological data, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological tests, infection was diagnosed by 2019-nCoV, according to the criteria published by the WHO.
During hospitalization, in addition to symptomatic treatment, the patient was treated with antibiotics (meropenem, linezolid) and antivirals (ganvir, oseltamivir).
All analytical tests gradually improved or became normal.
The patient was discharged on day 15 after admission.
