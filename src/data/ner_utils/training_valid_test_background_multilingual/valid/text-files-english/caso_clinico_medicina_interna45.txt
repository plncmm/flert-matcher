A 36-year-old woman with no previous history of interest.
She is married and has a healthy son and lives in a rural area located in Gran Canaria.
The patient is brought to the emergency department several times for a progressive clinical picture of 15 days of evolution of behavioral and intellectual alterations consisting of active psychomotor agitation, recurrent stereotypical movements of upper limbs and stereotypies.
Assessed in the Mental Health Unit, it was decided to admit the patient to the hospital to rule out organic causes of a probable mental disorder.
Having no organic data and normal TAC in the emergency room, the patient is admitted to the Psychiatry Department, where she develops a severe progressive deterioration of coordination and language, with generalized myoclonus.
One week after admission, she developed episodes of sweating, fever and bronchial secretions, associated with greater agitation, which is why she consulted internal medicine that values the patient and extends the study.
The general physical examination was normal.
Neurological examination revealed autistic attitude without connection to the environment, frontal release reflexes and absence of motor deficit.
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis obtained by lumbar puncture revealed the presence of 60 mononuclear cells with glucose and proteins in the normal range.
Licuoral findings in the context of an encephalopathic picture are investigated for parameningeal, toxic-metabolic and infectious causes.
Among the complementary tests performed, electroencephalographic findings stand out, which showed repeatedly slowing of cortical activity, with a base rhythm of theta waves.
Brain MRI showed mild left temporal lobe melanoma, and the brain CT scan was normal.
Analytical studies (except CK 770 U/L) and lumbar puncture performed one week later (without any treatment) were normal, with negative results in microbiological studies (VDRL V, PCR VV, PCR VZV).
The investigation of habitual toxicities in blood and urine was negative.
After two months of admission, she was discharged with a diagnosis of acute encephalopathy of unknown origin with residual neuropsychological impairment of frontal pattern. She had neurological deficits and dopaminergic drugs.
The patient was referred to outpatient clinic for follow-up, during which the results of the serology requested during admission were received, showing positive anti-Coxiella burnettia antibody positive IFI phase II positive to IFA IgG positive patient (Coxiella burnettise + 1 motivation, IgG positive to IFI positive to IFI phase IFA + 1 patient) + 1
Treatment was initiated with corticosteroids, although no clinical improvement was observed.
Imaging findings (CT, MRI and brain SPECT) were not significant.
In this context, the possible concomitance of other neuronal toxicity factors that explain the lack of resolution of the condition was contemplated.
A study of organic and inorganic toxics was carried out, whose results revealed the presence of Lindano substance in blood (2.247 mg/L), hair (0.420 mg/g) and urine (88 mg/L).
After discharge, a close follow-up was performed in the outpatient clinic, slowly progressing to progressive improvement, leaving the patient asymptomatic from the neurological point of view 15 months after the onset of symptoms.
