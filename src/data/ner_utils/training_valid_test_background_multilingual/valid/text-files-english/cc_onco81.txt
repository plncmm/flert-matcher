Anamnesis A 71-year-old patient with no drug allergies, personal history of emphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left pneumothorax in 1994 secondary to rupture of bullae that required pleurodesis hypertension, prostate adenoma E.
The clinical onset begins in May 2009 to develop dyspnea on moderate exertion for 48 hours and hemoptoic sputum.
Physical lobe A decrease in vesicular murmur in the right upper lobe is observed, with isolated associated roncus; adenopathies and enlarged lymph nodes are not identified.
Rest of the examination was normal.
▁Complementary tests » An initial study with chest X-ray was requested, showing a right paratracheal mass.
» In the May 2009 computed tomography (CT), an 88 mm right upper lobe pulmonary tumor (LSD) was visualized by means of an anterior mediastinal CT scan (20 mm pos-PET) of the main bronchus.
» The study was completed with a needle biopsy, with pathological result of adenocarcinoma of the lung, EGFR not mutated.
Diagnosis The case is discussed in a multidisciplinary committee of pulmonary pathology, and with the clinical judgment of lung adenocarcinoma cT4 N2 M0, stage IIIB, radiotherapy (RT) was decided concomitantly with chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intention.
Treatment Preplanning is performed, but volume 20 of 43%, pattern of bilateral centrilobular emphysema, as well as loss of volume of the left hemithorax with mediastinal retraction, do not advise the initiation of RT.
The patient was started on chemotherapy for induction with propylene-gemcitabine and was evaluated after three cycles in July 2009 in partial pulmonary and lymph node response.
The lesion in the right upper lobe decreased from 88 to 47 mm and the right mediastinal lymphadenopathy decreased from 20 to 14 mm.
The case was re-examined in a tumor committee and surgical treatment was refused because the pulmonary diffusion scintigraphy showed a heterogeneous distribution with right lung function of 41% and left lung function of 59%.
Preplanning was repeated, with 28% V20de, and chemotherapy was decided on weekly regimen with a Gytino-paclitaxel combination with radiotherapy, using five 6-Mev photon fields coliform ratio of up to 60 days.
Tolerance was good, with grade 1, 2 dermatitis and grade dermitis.
After▁concluding the treatment in October 2009, she presented a partial radiological response, with a decrease of 47 to 35 mm of the lesion in the right pulmonary lobe and 14 to 9 mm of the right mediastinal adenopathy.
A 30-month progression-free interval was observed, and an 11-mm LSD pulmonary nodule was observed in the control CT scan of April 2012.
The case is discussed again within the multidisciplinary committee, and it is considered that it is manageable by thermoablation by pulmonary radiofrequency with Le Veen electrode with maximum opening of 25 mm, aiming at remission after the procedure.
After a second progression-free interval of 8 months, in December 2012, there was evidence of progression in the anterior wall of the nodule previously treated with radiofrequency, with a maximum diameter of 16 mm.
The case is presented in a tumor committee and a second thermoablation of the nodule in the LSD is proposed over the cavitation area with Le Veen electrode, with maximum opening of 30 mm in diameter in two sessions by progressive removal.
In March 2014, one year and three months after the procedure, a contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan was performed, which showed no signs of progression.
The patient was diagnosed with acute leukemia associated with bilateral pneumonia Candida krusei and global respiratory failure, exitus on April 2, 2015.
