A 71-year-old male without known drug allergies or toxic habits.
Personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic stable ischemic heart disease, right periinsular ischaemic stroke, normal LVEF and multiple IgG myeloma in early progression.
In chronic treatment with calcium carbonate 600 mg, risedronic acid 5 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg, nitroglycerin▁patches 15 mg, bisoprazole coli 2.5 mg, other symptoms
Physical examination is anodyne except for the presence of left maxillary bone exposure.
Blood tests showed leukocytes 14000/uL, neutrophils 70% and CRP 12 mg/dl.
Chest radiography and electrocardiogram were normal.
The first suspicion was osteonecrosis of the jaw secondary to treatment with▁bisphosphonates. A CT scan of the face and paranasal sinuses was requested, in which a lytic lesion could be seen with some areas of sclerosed maxillary sinus showing decreased bone density.
Subsequently, he was referred to maxillofacial surgery for surgical excision of the lesion in left upper jaw and during surgery biopsy for pathological anatomy was extracted.
Biopsy revealed "sulphur▁granules" composed of microorganisms compatible with Actinomyces israelii, because we are dealing with a case of a patient with osteonecrosis of the left jaw.
After surgery, the patient persists with fever and hemodynamically stable.
Intravenous penicillin was administered for 2 weeks with good clinical response.
After hospital discharge, the patient was treated with oral amoxicillin for 6 months and was reviewed in an outpatient clinic.
Actinomyces israelii is a gram-positive bacillus that is part of the oropharyngeal and colonic flora.
Due to the increased use of▁bisphosphonates, the prevalence of osteonecrosis of the jaw has increased in recent years.
In addition, as a peculiarity of this case, the patient develops secondary actinomycetes.
