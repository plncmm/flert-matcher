Anamnesis An 80-year-old male who came to the emergency department complaining of gait instability and nausea for 2 days, with sudden onset while walking, with worsening of the condition in the last 24 hours.
The patient also had bitemporal oppressive headache of moderate intensity for 10 days and asthenia for one month.
Personal history: ex-smoker, dyslipidemia on dietary treatment, benign prostatic hyperplasia, recurrent urinary tract infections.
Family history: no interest.
Irrespective of basic activities of daily living.
Barthel scale of 100 points.
Physical examination: Good general condition, blood pressure 162/86 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, temperature 35.7 °C.
mucocutaneous coloration, normal perfusion and hydration, eupneic.
Induration of both temporary arteries, more pronounced on the right side; carotid thrombosis cardiac mass, irritated abdomen without murmurs; rhythmic edema without murmurs; peritoneal murmur without flails; conserved vesicular murmur.
Neurological evaluation: oriented, normal language, without apraxias or agnosias.
Seizures, normal-reactive limbs, cutaneous hemi- tachymosis right lateralis in the face-to-face balance test, face-to-face mobility, bilateral handicap, facial hair loss, facial hair loss;
NIHSS: 4 points.
Additional tests • Laboratory data: biochemistry, glucose 158 mg/dl, urea 61 mg/dl, CRP 20.4 mg/l, total cholesterol 229 mg/dl (HDL 57 mg/dl, LDL 151 mg/dl normal), blood count
VSG 17 mm/h.
Venous gas showed no significant alterations.
Urinalysis was normal.
Pituitary-thyroid system was normal.
PSA 21.49 mg/ml, without alteration of the other tumor markers.
Serology was negative for loos, HCV, HBV and HIV.
• EKG: sinus rhythm.
QRS 0.13.
▁Right bundle branch block with secondary changes in repolarization.
• Chest X-ray: cardiothoracic index within normal limits, without consolidations or effusions.
• Transcranial Doppler: acceleration of both middle cerebral arteries (MCA), more pronounced at the level of right M1, without identifying the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA).
Important reduction of flow in both vertebral arteries (VA), with inversion of flow in the basilar artery (BA).
• Supraaortic trunk duplex (SAT): normal carotid study.
Shock wave pattern in both VAs, compatible with their distal occlusion.
• Temporal Doppler ultrasound of the arteries: hypoechoic halo in both temporal arteries and their branches.
• Transthoracic echocardiography: slight dilation of the left atrium, with no other significant abnormalities.
• CT scan of the brain: hypodensities compatible with infarctions in the territory both cerebellar and inferior iliac arteries (PICA) and left PCA.
• Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): hyperintense lesions in T2 and FLAIR sequences, with a slight mass effect on the adjacent parenchyma and with blurring of left PICA infarcts in both territories, compatible.
Brain MRI images in T2 sequence showing signs of cerebral infarction in the territory of both PICA and left PCA.
• Cerebral CT angiography and ABT: occlusion of the V2 segment of both VAs.
Patent PCA and BA with persistent posterior communicating artery.
The carotid system showed no alterations.
CT angiography images of the supra-aortic trunks showed occlusion of the right proximal V2 and left distal V2.
Left ventricular ejection fraction at C2 level.
Diagnosis Brain infarction in the territory of both PICA and left PCA, of unusual etiology.
Giant cell arteritis
Treatment was admitted to the Stroke Unit.
After brain CT findings and neurosonological study, she received empirical steroid treatment (methylprednisolone 1 g/day, 5 days intravenously) and care and therapeutic recommendations according to the clinical pathway.
The diagnosis was later confirmed.
In addition to platelet antiaggregation, she continued to be treated with descending prednisone associated with prophylactic treatment of osteoporosis and statins.
The patients evolution improved progressively during hospitalization, with no additional complications, with a score of 3 points at discharge.
In the successive reviews she did not report new symptoms, the acute phase reactants were in normal range and the halo sign had been negativized, although she persisted with a score of 2 in the mRS at 3 months.
