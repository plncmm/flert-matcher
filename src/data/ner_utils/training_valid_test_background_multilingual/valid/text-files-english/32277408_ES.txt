A 63-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to sputum with sticky white sputum, fever of 39.3 °C, exertional dyspnea and chest oppression.
She had no history of heart disease or hypertension.
She had had allergic cough for 5 years and a history of smoking.
He had recently traveled to the province of Hubei (China).
Arterial gas at admission showed a pH of 7.049, PCO2 of 76.4 mmHG, PO2 of 66.2 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 91.8%.
Nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum tests were performed for the usual respiratory viruses, with negative results in all of them.
In addition, blood samples showed an increase in alanine-aminotransferase (97 U/L) and creatinine (157 μmol/L), together with hematuria, which indicated a change in renal capacity.
Chest X-rays showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia.
On the first day of admission COVID-19 was genetically confirmed by sputum tests.
Markers of myocardial lesions were high values of troponin I (11.35 g/L), myoglobin (390.97ng/mL) and brain natriuretic peptide n-600 pg/mL NCNT 22.
An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia without ST segment elevation. One on bedside showed left ventricular dilatation (61 mm), dyskinesia with a low fraction of diffuse myocardial declining echocardiogram LV (32%) and pulmonary hypertension (44 mmHg).
No pericardial effusion was observed.
The diagnosis was established in severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute fulminant myelitis and multiorgan failure.
The treatment applied was assisted respiration, high-flow physiotherapy, antiviral therapy lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon α-1b, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, renal piperacillin/itstative therapy.
11 days after admission, the pulmonary lesions continued to progress and the respirator was unable to maintain oxygen saturation.
The septate was thickened up to 14 mm and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased to 272.40 pg/mL.
As a consequence, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was applied to reduce lung load.
The speed of rotation of the ECMO was 3,500▁rpm, blood flow 4.30 L/min, air flow 4.00 L/min and FiO2 100%.
The patient's condition improved.
The analyses three days later showed that troponin I had decreased to▁0.10g/L, NSCLC was 750pg/mL, and interleukin-6 was 7.63pg/mL.
After the treatment, 68% of the patients with VI anomaly gradually returned to normal levels, and the LV and septum thickness returned to normal values. The bedside radiograph indicated that the lesions had decreased.
However, markers of infection gradually increased from day 26 onward and vasoactive agents were required to maintain blood pressure.
On day 29, Candida, human α-herpesvirus and β-herpesvirus were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; the hemocultives were positive for Baoides supervalus, indicating an aggravation.
The systolic pressure of the pulmonary artery and the systolic displacement of the tricuspid annulus plane showed sudden decreases on days 26 and 29, suggesting a deterioration of the right heart activity.
After a round of consultation with the expert group, the anti-infective treatment was reinforced, but the effect was not positive.
Septic shock and generalized intravascular coagulation, as well as cutaneous ecchymosis, occurred gradually.
The patient died on day 33 of hospitalization.
