Anamnesis The patient comes to the emergency room for exacerbation of his usual abdominal pain, located in the epigastrium and irradiated to both hypochondria, deaf and strong intensity, 8 out of 10 symptoms associated with first step analgesia.
Physical examination upon arrival at the emergency department revealed a blood pressure of 200/110 mm Hg.
Abdominal pain was present when the patient presented with right hemiabdomen pain and no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Rest of examination, including neurological, anodyne.
‚ñÅComplementary tests in the Emergency Department showed a worsening of its usual pattern of stasis (0.7IN and bilirubin 1.67, FA 406, GGT 739), increased enzymes of cytolysis (GOT 766, GPT4) and increased fibrinolysis.
Given the analytical alteration and abdominal pain, an abdominal CT is performed, showing bilateral renal infarctions and thrombosis of a branch of the hepatic artery, with subsequent ischemic areas.
Due to the presence of coagulopathy and visceral infarctions, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is initiated.
Also, given the change in liver profile, hepatotropic virus (HBV, HCV, CMV and EBV) testing is requested, which is negative.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Doctorate for study.

PHBM treatment for MS.
Sepsis is performed by endoscopic ultrasound of the mucosecretory pancreas to determine the filiation of the tumoral process, which results in a high-grade stage IV mucosecretory ductal carcinoma due to liver involvement.
During admission, the patient experienced an episode of dizziness, sweating and a sensation of loss of strength in the left hand, with elevation of and normal ECG.
An urgent cardiological evaluation was requested, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), in which a doubtful image of vegetation in the aortic valve and moderate aortic insufficiency were observed.
It was decided to extend the study with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
Finally, TEE shows an image compatible with endocarditis.
After this finding, microbiological cultures were taken and empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin was initiated.
The hemocultives were sterile and the patient continued without fever.
Control TTE and TEE were performed, where a mass adhered to the ventricular face of the right coronary leaflet persisted, which was impressive of having increased in size.
The study of microorganisms causing endocarditis with negative hemocultives was extended: serology of Q fever Brucella and Chlamydia pneumoniae; and PCR of Bartonella, Borrelia, Coxiella and Ringersia.
All of them were negative.
Due to the association between episodes of paroxysmal consciousness alteration (which were isolated with moments when LMWH was suspended punctually) and endocarditis image, a cranial CT was requested, which resulted normal.
At that time, an episode of transient global amnesia that had taken place 4 months before was considered, and which, a priori, had not been related to the tumor disease, since this symptom preceded the constitutional clinic.
From this perspective, it could not be ruled out that this event was related to the current MS condition, so a cranial magnetic resonance was requested, where supra and infratentorial infarctions of lacunar profile and cardiac origin were observed.
Unfortunately, the patient's liver profile progressively deteriorated.
This, associated with a marked clinical worsening, made the patient not a candidate for chemotherapy treatment and opted for exclusive symptomatic control.
