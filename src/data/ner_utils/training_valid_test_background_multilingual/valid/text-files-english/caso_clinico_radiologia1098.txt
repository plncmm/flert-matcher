A 6-year-old male patient with no morbid history, immunizations per day, adequate weight gain and psychomotor development.
The patient had a high respiratory condition of 3 weeks duration, without fever.
Three days prior to consultation, a history of moderate periumbilical abdominal pain, vomiting on several occasions is associated, with the day before consultation vér de la march.opía and ataxia being added.
Neurological examination revealed slow language, multidirectional nystagmus, tone and reflexes diminished symmetrically, with normal strength, positive Romberg and ataxic gait.
Lesions compatible with varicella were studied, some in crusting stage on face and scalp.
Diagnosis Acute post-infectious cerebellitis (CAPÍ).
A brain CT scan was performed on admission, which showed a hypodense lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with a slight mass effect on the IV ventricle.
It is complemented with MRI that identifies the same lesion that presents hyperintensity in sequences with long RT (especially in FLAIR) and reinforces significantly with the use of intravenous gadolinium.
Based on findings on physical examination with varicella-like lesions, intravenous treatment with Avir 500 mg/m2 dose is started every 8 hours.
The patient evolved with favorable clinical symptoms and resolution of symptoms.
The patient was discharged on the ninth day of hospitalization, completing nine days of intravenous treatment with antiretroviral therapy, with indication to complete 14 days of oral treatment with 500 mg every 12 hours on the remaining days.
Follow-up MRI was performed at discharge 10 days later, demonstrating the persistence of the described lesion, with a slight decrease in the inflammatory pattern.
A new outpatient follow-up was performed one month after discharge, with MRI showing significant regression of the lesion.
Brain MRI performed 10 and 30 days after the onset of cerebellar symptoms.
In the first control, there was a slight decrease in the size of the lesion, which was only noticeable in the later control.
This evolution supports the diagnosis of post-infectious acute cerebellitis.
