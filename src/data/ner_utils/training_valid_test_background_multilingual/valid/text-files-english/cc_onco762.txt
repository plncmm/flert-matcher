Anamnesis A 57-year-old man with no known drug allergies.
The relevant medical and surgical history included hypertension, congestive heart failure with multiple hospital admissions due to seizures and a depressive condition.
Follow-up by Internal Medicine due to PAN with idiopathic multiple mononeuritis.
She had been operated on for a perianal fistula for years.
Chronic treatment with beta-blockers, antidepressants and oral corticosteroids.
The patient consulted in June 2013 in Primary Care due to asthenia of several weeks of evolution, as well as occasional dyspepsia, without other accompanying symptoms.
Physical examination showed no relevant findings: good general condition, normal color, hydrated and perfused.
Vital signs in rank and affilia.
No peripheral lymphadenopathy.
Cardiopulmonary arrest was unaltered, abdominal examination was normal.
Lower limbs without edema.
‚ñÅComplementary tests Blood analysis (10/06/2013) showed anemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dl) of ferropenic profile, without other significant alterations.
Gastroscopy was also performed (26/06/2013) which showed a vegetating lesion of 3-4 cm at the carial level, ulcerated, taking samples of it for anatomopathological analysis.
Given the above finding, abdominal CT was performed (08/07/2013) confirming a sublaminate mass of approximately 4 cm in relation to probable gastric neoplasia without extension to fat and at least one adenopathy in the gastroheptic ligament.
Diagnosis The biopsy revealed moderately differentiated intestinal gastric adenocarcinoma.
Treatment The blood analysis showed anemia (Hb 9.5 mg/dl) of ferropenic profile, without other significant alterations. A gastroscopy was performed on samples of 3-4 cm showing an ulcerated lesion.
Abdominal CT was performed (08/07/2013) confirming a mass of approximately 2.42/cm tumor segment in relation to probable gastric neoplasia without extension to fat and at least one lymph node in asymptomatic Cametapulae ligament (IL) detected etiology 79.901
MRI (24/01/2014) confirmed a nodular lesion in segment VIII, with ring enhancement, suggestive of necrotic/abscessified metastases.
Given the anatomical difficulty to perform FNAB, it is evaluated in a multidisciplinary committee and, given the need for histological diagnosis, liver surgery is performed in elderly patients (three lesions), taking adenocarcinomas that showed 2/3 lesions hepatic).
Given the progression to this level, HER-2 is requested in order to plan oncospecific treatment, which is positive (++).
The study was completed with a normal echocardiogram and an abdominal CT scan (27/03/2018) showing the 3 hepatic LOE previously described.
First line treatment with cisplatin-capecitabine-trastuzumab was started in April 2018 with a response higher than 50% after 4 cycles. Relevant toxicities presented CMV infection that required hospital admission and hydrolytic alterations.
Given the persistence of these changes, it was decided to continue with trastuzumab monotherapy from the 5th cycle.
After 7 cycles, the patient continues to respond by CT, with persistence of only 1 cm liver lesion.
The case was reassessed in a committee and PET-CT was requested for evaluation of surgical rescue, finally being discouraged because PET-CT reveals peritoneal implant in mesogastrium, as well as two pulmonary duodenum etiologies.
Trastuzumab was continued as monotherapy with stable disease after 12 and 18 cycles.
After 22 cycles, a complete response by PET-CT and normalization of tumor markers were observed, so in July 2015 treatment was started.
In May 2016 (ILP of 10 months) showed an analytical increase in Ca 19.9, with no data on disease on CT, but with evidence on PET-CT scan of liver dome injury.
The second line is initiated with 5-FU + trastuzumab, with good tolerance and a new complete radiological response after 8 cycles.
However, PET continued to show a focus of hypermetabolism (although with decreased glucose activity compared to the previous one) at the level of the hepatic dome, so it was decided to perform a multidisciplinary and curative surgery again.
On March 1, 2015 a liver mastectomy was performed in segment VIII.
The patient is currently undergoing outpatient follow-up without recurrence data.
