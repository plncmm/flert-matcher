A 50-year-old man, undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, came to the emergency department with non-contrast cough for 7 days.
Her past medical history included renal failure due to diabetes, which was treated with ambulatory hemodialysis three times a week, hypertension and chronic infection with hepatitis B virus. An epidemiological evaluation revealed that she had traveled to January 20Chhan in the middle of her towns.
The patient was admitted to the hospital two weeks later with hypoxemia (90% oxygen saturation in room air) without fever or myalgia.
Physical examination showed a temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure of 184/107 mmHg, pulse of 74 l.p.m.
normal bilateral breathing sounds.
Laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 3.38 × 109/L with 77.5% neutrophils, 15.7% lymphocytes and 0%▁eosinophils.
C-reactive protein and procalcitonin values were 40.1 mg/L and 0.73 ng/mL, respectively.
Liver capacity and cardiac enzyme values were within normal ranges.
A chest CT scan revealed multiple bilateral ground glass opacities.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 were positive twice in samples of pharyngeal smears.
Based on the epidemiological characteristics and these results, the diagnosis was COVID-19 pneumonia.
As soon as COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed, the patient with IDCD had a specialized hospital and received hemodialysis in a room with isolation equipment designed for patients with IDCOV-19, where all other hemodialysis patients have possible atypical symptoms 42.
Although the patient did not have the usual symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, nasal congestion,▁malaise, headache or myalgia, he had cough and dyspnea. Consequently, a nucleic acid test for SARS-patients was performed 14 days later.
Because of the precautions taken by the medical team, SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed on the staff, which were negative and were not isolated.
The patient was treated with topical antibiotics with nasal cannula, regular haemodialysis, antihypertensives, moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) and antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (2 tablets twice daily).
No potential side effects of lopinavir/ritonavir were observed during treatment, such as nausea, diarrhoea and occasional dizziness.
After 8 days of treatment, nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 were negative twice in pharyngeal smears, cough had improved analytical tests and chest CT images showed improvement.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
