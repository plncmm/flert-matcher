A four-year-old male with no relevant past medical history was successfully vaccinated. The patient developed fever of 38.5 oC for 12 hours (h), painful submandibular lymphadenopathy, erythematous pharynx with‚ñÅexudate.
In addition, the patient presented a micropapular fold raised in a "cow skin" that affected the trunk and the inguinal and axillary folds, slightly pruritic and slightly painful exanthema.
fever, coughing up to a total of 72 hours, a rapid test for Streptococcus pyogenes was performed, which was negative, so an expectant management was decided and a clinical examination was performed in 24-48 hours.
At that time, the patient is clinically well, afflicted and exanthema has become manifest, so it was decided to complete the treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for eight days.
Two weeks after the onset of fever, the patient developed desquamation of "gloving finger" plants and palms.
