A 6-year-old atopic girl presented angioedema after ingestion of a Norway lobster and anaphylaxis after ingestion of a chicken and panca thigh.
Tolera eggs, tuna and broad canned.
No contact with birds.
Prick tested positive for cod, hake, sole and gall and negative for tuna, salmon, cocoa, chicken meat, chicken▁feathers, canary▁feathers.
Prick-prick with raw and cooked lobster, thigh and breast: positive for raw thigh and breast.
Blood analysis: total IgE 185 kU/L, IgE to extracts: chicken meat 1.15 kU/L, tuna 2.12 kU/L, salmon 1.43 kU/L, paran
▁Exposure test (ECT) with lobster: negative.
COC with well cooked chicken breast: negative, presenting oropharyngeal pruritus with subsequent intake at home.
SDS Immunoblotting shows albumin parvalbumin panga, and IgE fixation in chicken thigh extract in a band of approximately 16 kDa, corresponding to a parv of approximately 16 kDa.
Immunoblotting inhibits panga and demustra chicken that in the patient's serum there are IgE populations that cross-recognize the parvalbumins of these two foods.
Conclusions: We present a case of allergy to chicken and panga due to parevalbumin, demonstrating cross-reactivity between parvalbumin and pangacandida (a.k.a. chicken albumin-pescatch).
