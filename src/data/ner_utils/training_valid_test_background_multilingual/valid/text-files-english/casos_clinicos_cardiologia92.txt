A 75-year-old male patient attended the emergency department from external cardiology clinics with significant clinical deterioration, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, nocturnal dyspnea on minimal exertion and dyspnea on minimal exertion.
Background, current disease and physical examination Background No known drug allergies.
Risk factors: diabetes mellitus 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia.
He had been an ex-smoker for 7 years of 50 packs/year.
Medical history: COPD.
Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery in March 2008.
Surgical interventions: hemorrhoids, epigastric hernia, colonic▁polypectomy.
Bladder tumor treated with TUR in 2011 and 2013.
Cardiopathy prior to diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in 2002 with severely depressed systolic function (LVEF 20%), and normal coronary arteries in cardiac catheterization.
Follow-up in outpatient cardiology clinics, with significant improvement in ventricular function with medical treatment (LVEF 50% on echocardiogram, 2008, 2010 and 2012).
In November 2013, the patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, electrical cardioversion was performed in the emergency department, which was effective and discharged.
A week later, the patient came back to the emergency department with atrial fibrillation, where electrical cardioversion was again performed, and sinus rhythm was started and discharged.
During an outpatient visit in January 2014, the patient was again in atrial fibrillation.
Usual treatment: dabigatran mg/12h, bisoprol 10 mg/24h, ramipryl 2.5 mg/24h, rosustatin 20 mg/24h, inhaled bromide 20 mg/24h, furosstatin
Current disease: a 75-year-old male patient attended the emergency department from external cardiology clinics for presenting significant clinical deterioration in the last weeks, with dyspnea on minimal exertion, ortopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He did not report any symptoms of respiratory infection or other accompanying symptoms.
On admission, the patient presented atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response at 130-150 bpm despite treatment at maximum beta-blocker doses, so she was referred for admission to the cardiology department to try to control heart rate or heart rate.
AF 120 mmHg.
HR 155 bpm, Ta 36.5 oC.
Sat.
O2 96% with FiO2 0.21.
Patient was conscious, normocolored and normohydrated.
Cardiac auscultation revealed cardiac tones with no murmurs.
Pulmonary emphysema is defined as a generalized decrease in vesicular murmur, with biphasic crackles.
Lower limbs: no edema, no signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Abdomen: blando, no painful upon fixation.
▁Complementary tests ECG: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, narrow QRS, did not present intraventricular conduction abnormalities.
Signs of left ventricular overload in V5-V6 and DI and aVL.
Chest X-ray: Interstitial chest X-ray abnormalities suggestive of heart failure.
Free costophrenic sinuses.
Cardiothoracic index lower than 0.5.
Analytical performed in the cardiology ward: Leukocyte: 12.4x10e9/L, Hb17.5 g/dl, platelets 262x10e9/L.
Coagulation: TPT 15s, IQ: 76%, APTT 35.3s.
Glucose: 140 mg/dl, urea 64 mg/dl, creatinine 1.21 mg/dl, K 5 MM/L, Na 143 MM/L, AST 31 U/L, ALT 41 MM/ 167 pg/L
Glycosylated hemoglobin: 6.9%.
Echocardiogram: Poor echocardiographic window.
Left ventricle slightly dilated, non-hypertrophic, with severely depressed global contraction (20-25%), severe apex hypokinesia.
Moderate left atrium.
Thickened mitral valve with mild regurgitation
Sclerosed aortic valve, with good opening, without failure.
▁Right cavities with moderate atrium.
Preserved RVEF.
The inferior vena cava was not affected, with good inspiratory collapse.
No pericardial effusion was observed.
The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward with atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response to 140-150 days without being controlled for the following 130-140 days despite the increase in bisopol to a dose of 15 mg/24h and the addition of digoxin
Failure to control previous episodes and difficult heart rate control was decided jointly by the clinical team, electrophysiologists and the family, to perform atrioventricular node and cardiac ablation.
▁Definitive diagnosis was established with the intention of placing electrodes on the LV for cardiac restraining therapy (CRT), but this was not possible because coronary sinus dissection occurred.
DDD was finally placed.
Five days later, ablation of the atrioventricular node was performed without incidents.
The patient was discharged with better clinical control, maintaining the same anticoagulant treatment, with withdrawal of the treatment digoxin, amiodarone and the high doses of bisoprolol with which the heart rate had been tried to reduce.
The medication was maintained for management of heart failure.
Diagnosis atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response difficult to control.
Frequency control strategy by ablation of AV node and implantation of implanted electrodes.
Tachycardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction.
