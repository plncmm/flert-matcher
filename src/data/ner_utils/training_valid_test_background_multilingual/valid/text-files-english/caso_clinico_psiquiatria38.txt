The patient and his surroundings Luis is a man who at the time of the first psychiatric consultation is 23 years old.

He has worked as a construction pony, with a last job six months before the first consultation.
No relevant personal history and no previous psychiatric consultations.
No personality disorder and adequate psychosocial functioning in the year prior to the onset of symptoms.
It's the fourth of five brothers.
The paternal grandmother suffered schizophrenia.
A brother, who treats the patient, also follows treatment for schizophreniform disorder associated with substance use.
The father died four years earlier due to a stroke.
The mother is blind and requires support to perform domestic tasks, which has been provided by the patient until the current episode.
The reference relative is one of the siblings.
Drinking toxic substances At 14 years Luis started smoking tobacco and hach√≠s, according to the family "for frequenting bad companies".
Between 16 and the first psychiatric consultation at 23 years old, he has smoked between 6 and 7 hatchers every day.
According to the patient, he smoked hatchets because "he sought mentality, laughed at me...".
He has sporadically used marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and "speed".
Drink alcohol moderately.
She has never consumed LSD or heroin.
She has not presented behavioral addictions.
Clinical features established as an emergency in the Addictive Behaviors Unit in Primary Care, "for a problem of marijuana consumption, antisocial behavior and lately aggressive behavior with his mother".
Love the family that has been increasingly isolated for about four months, at home they see him talk and laugh alone.
He has carelessly taken of his personal desire.
It has been repeatedly denounced due to minor deficiencies in the neighborhood.
In the first exploration, he did not cooperate and showed a paranoid, hostile and oppositionist attitude, with bad contact.
Language is disintegrated, with alogical associations.
It is not possible to explore mental contents due to lack of collaboration.
It does not refer to delirious contents of thought.
In a new retrospective assessment months later, with total remission of symptoms, symptoms related to the mental disorder were not observed at any time; the evolution was not observed either in the past seven delusional clinical manifestations.
Diagnosis and differential diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR the following criteria of schizophrenia are met: - A(4): catatonic or severely disorganized behavior.
- A (5): negative symptoms (social isolation).
- B: social/occupational dysfunction.
- D: exclusion of schizoaffective and mood disorders.
Criterion C (duration of at least six months) and E (exclusion of substance use and medical illness) are not met.
Since it is evident the association of psychiatric symptoms with substance use (which according to the clinical judgment is estimated is a causal relationship, being cannabis use the cause and psychosis the effect) arises the differential diagnosis with a psychotic disorder.
However, the criterion A of this diagnostic entity is not met (affective beliefs or attitudes of delusions), but psychotic symptoms have been predominantly hebephrenic in this patient with language disorganization of behavior.
Therefore, the diagnosis of unspecified cannabis-related disorder (FD) was made.
According to ICD-10, a diagnosis of psychotic disorder can be made by cannabis with a predominance of polymorphous symptoms (P53), considering symptomatology and in the absence of disorganized or delirium.
Treatment and evolution Initially risperidone (4 mg/day) is prescribed, which the patient does not take due to refusal of treatment.
After outpatient follow-up, one month after the first consultation, depot treatment with flufenacin decanoate (12.5 mg/month) was initiated.
Two weeks after the first injection contact improved significantly, hostility and paranoidism appeared and was shown to be a contributor.
After the second injection, slight akathisia appeared, so the patient was advised to follow up regularly, but without pharmacological treatment.
Since the first interview, motivational treatment was given to stop cannabis use, affecting the probable causal relationship with psychotic symptoms.
The patient reported having abandoned the consumption of hatchets since the first moment of follow-up.
At eight months of follow-up, six months after the last administration of flufenacin decanoate, the patient was asymptomatic, with adequate affection and no formal thought disorders.
The family reports that her behavior is normal, although she has not tried to seek again, she has few social relationships and "it takes a long time to look at the window".
Urine toxicology was negative for THC, cocaine, opioids and anaphylaxis.
Some family members ask for psychiatric reports to recognize a handicap that generates the right to receive a mental illness.
Others feel fixed saying that "giving a child would kill this boy alive".
Finally, we opted not to request recognition of handicap and start a psychosocial rehabilitation program aimed at rapid return to normal work.
Likewise, motivational treatment is maintained to continue treating toxic substances early and monitoring for the detection of eventual psychotic prodromes.
