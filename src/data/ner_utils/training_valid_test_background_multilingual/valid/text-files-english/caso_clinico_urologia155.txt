Anamnesis A 53-year-old male patient with a history of allergy to penicillin, asthma and hypertension, who consulted due to the appearance of a week of evolution, of a painful ventral tumor of approximately 3 cm left side of the penis syndrome.
He denies febrile syndrome.
Physical examination In the middle third of the spongy body a stony ovoid area of 3 x 2 cm in diameter is observed.
This region is painful upon examination, with local heat and erythema.
On examination, the tests were normal in size, morphology and consistency.
Additional tests • Blood count highlights leukocytosis 17.50 x 109/l, neutrophilia 9.78 x 109/l, monocytes 0.92 x 109/l, normal controls 1.96 x 109/l; rest of the test within the limits
• Regarding coagulation and biochemistry, the results were within normal limits.
• Leukocytes of 50-100/field stood out in the urine sediment, with the rest of the parameters showing normality.
A culture of urethral▁exudate was performed: culture of Mycoplasmas negative, objectifying a positive culture of Neisseria gonorrhoea multiresistant (resistant: ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetra penicillin.
Ceftriaxone).
Polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydia trachomatis negative.
Diagnosis Paraurethral discharge due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection.
Treatment Given the findings discussed, it was decided to admit the patient in a programmed manner for excision-drainage of the described lesion.
The patient underwent surgical intervention, exeresis of the paraurethral cyst became necessary.
During surgery, an ovoid tumor is observed at the mid-third of the ventral surface of the penis, 3 x 2 cm in diameter, indurated, adhered to the urethra in its posterior face.
Bladder catheterization was performed with Foley 14 Ch without incidents, with subsequent opening by planes and release-exeresis of the tumor, with purulent fluid coming out of its interior.
The integrity of the penile urethra was verified.
The urinary catheter Foley 14 Ch is maintained.
A fragment of the paraurethral cyst capsule is sent as a sample to Pathological Anatomy.
Closure was performed by planes, spongy body with loose points of Vicryl 3-0, and subcutaneous tissue and skin with loose points of Vicryl rapide 3-0.
The results of the Pathological Anatomy of the▁resected specimen showed as pathological diagnosis: compatible with inflamed paraurethral cyst wall.
In addition, medical treatment was performed with dexketoprofen trometamol 25 mg/12 h for 4 days, and if there was pain, ofloxacin 200 mg/12 h for 10 days, metronidazole 500 mg/8 h for 10 days.
The bladder catheterization was maintained for 10 days.
The patients evolution is favorable,▁tolerating the diet, surgically resembling a stable appearance and attending consultations after discharge from hospital on the first postoperative day and following outpatient treatment.
Subsequently, the analytical parameters were normalized and the physical examination showed no injury.
