Anamnesis A 30-year-old woman with a history of uncomplicated right renal colic 5 years earlier.
She did not report any other medical or surgical history.
Allergy to ciprofloxacin.
She was referred to our clinic for the study of recurrent episodes of voiding syndrome during the last 6 months.
The patient describes symptoms such as pollakiuria, dysuria and tenesmus, which sometimes are accompanied by fever and pain in the right renal fossa.
Clinical improvement is only partially achieved with antiarrhythmic therapy.
It provides several urocultives, all of them negative.
Five years before, an intravenous urography had been performed in the context of a right renal colic, with no findings.
Physical training Good general condition
Afebril.
Arterial hypertension 128/85 mmHg.
The abdomen was blunt and depressible, with no masses or enlargement.
Body mass index 26.
Something bothers right kidney percussion.
Rest of the examination showed no findings.
▁Complementary tests • Blood count and biochemistry: no alterations.
• Urine sediment: pH: 6.
Isolated leucocyturia without hematuria or bacteriuria.
• Serial urocultives: negative.
• BAAR staining smear: negative.
• Abdomen-thoracic radiography: no findings.
• Urological ultrasound: grade I hydronephrosis in the right urinary tract.
The situation, size and echostructure of both kidneys are normal.
No space-occupying lesions were observed.
A good capacity beam without findings.
Normal internal genitals.
• Urine cytology: intense inflammatory signs, with no cellularity suggestive of malignancy observed.
• Intravenous urography: when compared to the previous 5 years, the complete functional cancellation of the right kidney without objectifying cause is the key.
Normal left kidney.
• Diuretic renogram: total absence of right renal function and normal left renal function.
• Cystoscopy: normal bladder mucosa.
No space occupying lesions.
Ortotopic ureteral meatodes.
•▁Right ascending pyelography: normal pyeloouret morphology without signs suggestive of obstruction.
Diagnosis We are faced with a young woman with chronic voiding syndrome, negative urocultives and functional cancellation of the right kidney without objectifying cause.
Sedimentary urine (sterile urinary pyuria) was isolated and, despite negative BAAR staining, mycobacteria-specific urine culture was requested in Lowestein-Jensen medium.
At 6 weeks, the growth of Mic tuberculosis was reported.
Although more sensitive than bacilloscopy, the culture of the tuberculous bacillus in a specific medium has the disadvantage of slow growth (between 6 and 8 weeks).
Treatment The therapeutic regimen for respiratory tuberculosis is superimposable for genitourinary disease.
There is no ideal treatment scheme and, according to the clinic, comorbidity and therapeutic adherence of the patient, one treatment regimen or another can be chosen.
According to the bacteriological bases, to cure tuberculosis, the recommended therapeutic regimen in Spain is 6 months, with four first-line drugs during the first 2 months (isoniazid and rifampicin, rifampicin).
The indication to add and treat all possible resistances is established.
However, the same scheme for non-elementary care continues to be valid for most patients with TB in Spain1.
Therefore, due to its potential nephrotoxicity, it was decided to prescribe the scheme without ethamphase-2-patient, starting with a combined preparation of 120 mg iscid, pyrazinamide 300 mg and rifampicin 50 mg once daily administered.
After this period, the maintenance phase was continued for 4 months with daily single dose of another combination of isoniazid 300 mg, rifampicin 600 mg (4HR) and vitamin B6 50 mg (the latter preparation includes prophylaxis).
During anti-tuberculosis treatment, periodic controls with a triple objective are essential: to verify the efficacy of the medication, to stimulate the correct compliance and to discover the toxicity of the drugs early.
The most common and dangerous side effects of treatment are liver toxicity.
In our case, we programmed controls every 2 months, including liver enzyme and renal function analyses, and two urine samples from the first morning micturition (for bacilloscopy and culture, respectively).
Microbiological control was continued until one year of follow-up.
The result of all controls was negative and tolerance and therapeutic adherence were optimal.
Despite adequate response to medical treatment, pain in the right renal fossa persisted recurrently with moderate intensity.
Therefore, in the absence of functionality of this renal unit, laparoscopic nephrectomy was proposed.
Ureteral excision is not mandatory and it is accepted that medical therapy is able to sterilize the residual ureter.
During the intervention, the accused adhesions of perirenal tissues, frequently described in these cases, were noteworthy, although they did not represent major surgical problems.
The pathological study of the piece confirmed renal involvement compatible with previous tuberculosis infection.
Four years after nephrectomy, the patient is asymptomatic, maintains good renal function with creatinine levels of 0.9 mg/dl and has had a full term pregnancy without problems.
