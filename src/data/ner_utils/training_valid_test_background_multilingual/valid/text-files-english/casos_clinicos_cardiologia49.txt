ANTECE due to non-ADMINATION OF NURSING21 AND EXPLORTS We report the case of a 72-year-old patient who underwent surgery for severe symptomatic febrile aortic stenosis with implantation of a biological aortic prosthesis (Mitro
The patient had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and was treated with enalapril 10mg, one tablet every 12 hours, and simvastatin 40 mg, one tablet a day.
Three months after the intervention, the patient was seen in the emergency department with fever (> 38°C), asthenia, anorexia and deterioration of the general condition of two weeks.
Physical examination revealed hemodynamically stable (TA 140 mmHg; HR 75 bpm; SatO2 97 % breathing room air).
Cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed rhythmic, tachycardic sounds, with systolic murmur II/VI in the aortic area, with no clinical signs of heart failure.
Anonymous examination revealed no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUEBES At admission laboratory tests, elevated white blood cell counts (16,000/μL) and normal neutrophil counts (87 %) were observed with elevated acute phase reactants (APC 267 %).
The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and signs of growth of left cavities with overload pattern.
On admission, 4 serial hemocultive tandes were extracted, isolated in all guidelines recommended by Staphylococcus epidermis, according to the established guidelines, antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, rifampicin and gentamicin was initiated.
As a first approach, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed, which showed a biological prosthesis in aortic position, with adequate opening of its velums, without the presence of periprosthetic regurgitation.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no evidence of prosthetic dysfunction or conclusive signs of endocarditis.
Given the high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis, it was decided to extend the study with positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET/CT), which showed an increase in the aortic root uptake.
A new TEE was performed 2 weeks after the first study, which showed signs of endocarditis with significant periprosthetic involvement: presence of peri-iannular pseudoaneurysm with signs of periprosthetic vegetation.
EVOLUTION After two weeks of antibiotic therapy with negative blood cultures, valve replacement surgery and repair of atrial septal fistula with pericardial patch were performed.
Microbiological analysis of the surgical tissue removed showed abundant polymorphonuclear cells without microorganisms in Gram stain, and the culture was finally negative.
DIAGNOSIS OF early infectious endocarditis caused by biological aortic prosthesis epidermis.
Periprocedural pseudoaneurysm, fistulated to right chamber.
Antibiotic and surgical treatment with good evolution.
