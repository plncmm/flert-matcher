Anamnesis A 33-year-old man with a history of spring allergy to several pollens and cutaneous myiasis after traveling to Senegal in 2000, who consulted for pruritic skin lesions on his back of Brazil.
The patient had spent 15 days on beach vacation in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, located on the northeast coast of that country.
The last days of her stay she noticed a "feet bone delay", followed by a very pruritic rash, which had started growing, drawing "camines" on the back of both feet.
Before the consultation, she had applied mometasone cream, without improvement of the lesions.
Elevated left dorsal tract erythematous plaques in the distal dorsal area of both feet including the fingers, which converge in the form of serpent foci;‚ñÅpapules are observed
Diagnosis Given the clinical appearance of the lesions and the epidemiological history, the diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans is made and treatment is initiated without further diagnostic tests.
Treatment The decision was made to treat with Albendazole 400 mg/12 h for three days, along with Dexchlorpheniramine 6 mg/ 12 h.
The patient reported a great improvement in lesions since the first day of treatment.
The seizure was completely resolved within 10 days without leaving psyche.
