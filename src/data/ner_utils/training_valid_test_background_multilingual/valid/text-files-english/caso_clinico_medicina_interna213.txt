An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of disorientation, 38o fever and headache.
The patient was allergic to pyrazolones, dyslipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with Acenocoumarol, non-revascularized coronary artery disease with preserved LVEF and prostate adenocarcinoma in complete remission.
He was independent for basic activities of daily living with an active life and without cognitive impairment.
Physical examination revealed decreased level of consciousness with a tendency to drowsiness, bradylalia, mental retardation.
A cranial computerized tomography (CT) was performed, which showed no abnormalities, so empirical treatment with ARE and Ceftriaxone was started.
The patient was admitted and the lumbar puncture was postponed because the patient was anticoagulated.
During the course of admission she developed skin lesions approximately two millimeters, predominantly on the trunk, some of them vesicular and pustular with similar lesions in the buccal mucosa.
Among the complementary tests performed, blood tests and radiography showed no relevant changes and the hemocultive tests were sterile.
Subsequently, after anticoagulation was withdrawn, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) puncture was performed, obtaining a x chromosome fluid with 230 leukocytes/mcL (90% mononuclear), 40% glucose and 210 mg/dL protein.
Suspicion of viral meningitis was suspected and serological tests for HBV, HCV, HIV, EBV, CMV, HSV 1, HSV2, HSV6, HSV8 and colds were performed, which were negative.
Serology and PCR for VZV in CSF were positive.
Samples were also taken from the skin lesions that were also positive for VZV.
Diagnosis of VZV encephalitis is continued with conservative treatment, initially with good outcome.
On the seventh day, however, the patient began with decreased level of consciousness and agitation.
We performed a MRI in which multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhagic lesions were detected at the level of the right temporal uncus as well as hemorrhagic lesions at the cortico-subcortical level.
Therefore, the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke secondary to VZV vasculitis is established.
During the course of an admission, the patient also presented with uncontrollable vomiting of central origin that were treated with Clorproma.
After clinical improvement, the patient was finally discharged to a rehabilitation center where she progressed with the recovery of her functional status.
