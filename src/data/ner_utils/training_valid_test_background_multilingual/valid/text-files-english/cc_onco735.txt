Cancer history Male patient with personal history at the time of the oncological diagnosis of dyslipidemia treated with atorvastatin 40 mg daily, active smoking with a cumulative consumption of 30 pack-years, infection due to sinus steroid resection secondary to hepatitis B virus.
As family history highlights mother with breast cancer.
It was diagnosed in October 2013 at the age of 51, due to repeated episodes consisting of headache, dizziness and language blocks, of a left parietotemporal brain lesion with mass effect.
Biopsy was performed to obtain an anatomopathological diagnosis of grade II astrocytoma with oligodendroglioma component grade II, negative for 1p/19q deletion, which is currently considered a primary CNS tumor (2016).
She underwent surgical removal of the lesion by magnetic resonance imaging located in the ocuent zone and was treated with radiotherapy, which ended in January 2014, June successively with clinical improvement and radiological stability of the disease, with 20 MRI controls.
On this date, when the patient was asymptomatic, a new control was performed with brain MRI, which showed tumor progression at the level of the left frontal lobe, with suggestive data of increased grade.
The case was presented to the neurological tumor committee and a biopsy was scheduled to confirm the degree and subsequent administration of systemic chemotherapy.
Anamnesis A 55-year-old male with a history previously described who came to the emergency room on July 30, 2017 for a disorder of language of approximately three days of evolution, along with deviation of the last 24 hours of oral commissure.
Physical examination The patient was hemodynamically stable.
There is no jugular engorgement.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal examination was normal.
There are no lower limb edemas or signs of deep venous thrombosis.
Neurological examination revealed motor aphasia and right central facial paresis, with no other abnormalities.
‚ñÅComplementary tests Urgent non-contrast-enhanced cranial CT showed large left frontal vasogenic edema probably related to progression of the already known lesion, with no other apparent complications.
Diagnosis Clinical and radiological progression with large left vasogenic cerebral edema of grade II cerebral astrocytoma.
Intravenous treatment of tumoral progression with the presence of significant vasogenic edema, corticoid treatment with dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg every 6 hours is established.
Sepsis is defined as admission to the Neurosurgery Department for close clinical surveillance and new brain MRI, which shows tumor progression to a left frontal subcortical level, with convexity degree effect and a significant sulci line accompanied by a
During admission, the patient has a favorable clinical evolution, with the initiation of a paulatine decrease in the corticosteroid dose.
At discharge, the patient presented good functional status, with a score on the EC component score of 0.
From the oncological point of view, considering progression 5 mg/ with increased grade and short interval neurological worsening, it was decided to reject brain biopsy to initiate chemotherapy with total dose of 280 mg temozolamide (total dose of
On 08/07/2017, the first cycle begins with good tolerance.
After four cycles of treatment, the disease was re-evaluated, and resolution of almost all vasogenic edema and disappearance of frontal lesions on previous MRI were observed on MRI.
Favorable radiological response was maintained with temozolamide at the same dose, with a total of seven cycles, the last on 03/07/2018.
During this time, the patient is clinically asymptomatic except for a mild episode of dizziness and has no adverse reactions to temozolamide.
However, since the administration of the last cycle of temozolamide, the patient presents a significant clinical deterioration, with speech and writing disorders.
Treatment with oral dexamethasone 2 mg every 12 hours was initiated and a new MRI (09/04/2018) was requested, showing extensive tumor progression, mainly at the level of the inferior convexity and the sylvian opercular structures.
Once progression has been confirmed, a second line of treatment with fotemustine was started, and the first cycle was started on April 10, 2018.
Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and is waiting to go to the clinic for clinical control and toxicity.
