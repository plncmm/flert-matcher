A 60-year-old male with a history of aortic prosthesis and double coronary bypass, with pericardiectomy complicated by bacteremia due to S. epidirmitis.
It comes from diarrheas of 24 hours of evolution.
Examination revealed fever and hypotension.
Laboratory tests revealed a CRP of 12.07 mg/dl and metabolic acidosis.
An abdominal X-ray showed colonic disfunction and wall edema.
Given the torpid evolution and tendency to hypotension, the ICU requested abdominal CT with IVC, showing a generalized dilation of the colonic frame, with thickening of the submucosal wall (nodular sign and edema).
Acquired peritoneal fluid and little involvement of the pericholic fat.
The findings are compatible with pancolitis.
Given the history of recent intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics, Clostridium difficile pseudomedullary colitis is suggested.
Toxins A and B were positive in feces at 24h.
