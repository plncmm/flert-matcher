A black girl born in Equatorial Guinea and living in Spain with adoptive parents since the age of 6 is presented.
The patient had a history of several episodes of urticaria and oedema of the extremities for several years.
At 8.3 years of age, he traveled to Equatorial Guinea where he had suffered two weeks.
Six months later she consulted for a new urticarial exanthema on the inner thighs with intense pruritus.
After treatment with oral antihistamines pruritus improved slightly and rash did not change.
One month later, she began with occasional episodes of blurred vision and itching in the left eye.
The family itself and subsequently the ophthalmology service▁appreciated in the patient's eye an element with a "gusano" shape of approximately 1 cm long, which moved under the conjunctiva.
A complete blood count was performed, showing a slight count (700/μl) and the presence of microfilariae was studied in direct preparations and after concentration (Knott technique) of peripheral blood extracted at 12:00 h.
Serology against A. aegypti using ELISA as antigen a crude antigen 2 using adult Brugiaya and Onchocerca volus (National Center of Microbiology: IgG, total fila4 IgGda) showed a negative pattern.
The diagnosis of loiasis was suspected, and the patient was treated with diethylcarbamide at non-progressive doses for the first 3 days and continued until completing 21 days of treatment, with which the rash and pruritus of the thigh disappeared.
During treatment she occasionally presented fever and general▁malaise.
filariasis caused by the nematode Loa loa is an endemic parasitosis of Central and West Africa 1-5, where up to 13 million people could be infected.
The tape measure is defined as:
The infection is transmitted by bites of flies of the genus Chrysops; the larva, after a subcutaneous ripening close to the year, is▁inoculated into the adult worm cell tissue.
In bisexual▁parasites, the adult worm releases microfilariae to the▁bloodstream that can be captured by the vector in a new sting.
Loa loa causes a chronic infection in humans, in which it can live more than 15 years, causing manifestations mainly due to hypersensitivity reactions to the adult worm.
The main clinical manifestation is the swelling of theabar (areas of angioedema, pruriginous, located mainly in the extremities), and less frequently, the subconjunctival migration of the adult Cal.
