We present a 35-year-old man who was admitted to our unit with fever of 1 month of evolution after an intravenous procedure.
You have a history of two pericarditis
Eleven months before admission, the patient developed deep venous thrombosis in the extensive left lower limb (anti-lapical positivity in one determination) and May-Thurner syndrome was found to be the cause.
After 10 months of anticoagulant treatment, the patient developed severe postprandial syndrome, which led to percutaneous pharmacomechanic thrombectomy in the left iliac vein with placement of a venous stent.
10 days after the procedure, the patient developed fever.
He had been admitted twice in the last month for fever, performing a thorough study (cultivational, serology, autoimmunity, computerized tomography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms) without finding the cause.
Finally, he was admitted to our center where further study was carried out.
In the anamnesis they highlight high fever (40oC) with tiritone, daily and odynophagia, also frequent oral ulcers and appression by ornithology and visit to the field before the onset of fever.
On physical examination: fever and oral aphthae.
PET-CT showed thrombosis of 3 cm in the right ventricle, stent retrombosis with uptake points in both sites suggestive of infection, in addition to thrombosis of the inferior vena cava up to the infrarenal level and thrombosis of the right iliac vein.
Hemocultivations and serologies with negative results, except C. burni G phase I title 1/800.
We performed a difficult differential diagnosis of intracardiac thrombus (septic thrombophlebitis of the stent and infective endocarditis, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, endocarditis due to chronic Q fever) and finally diagnosed with extensive venous thrombosis.
Treatment consists of remission of fever, general improvement and reduction of thrombi.
