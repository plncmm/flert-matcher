He had a left hip prosthesis and took oral contraceptives.
contact with animals, toxic habits or other relevant backgrounds.
Current illness occurred in the Internal Medicine Department of our hospital in December 2007 due to generalized pruritus without skin lesions of years of evolution, loss of 5-6 kg of weight in the last two years and occasional presence of "pituitary".
It provided analytical control carried out in June 2006 where absolute eosinophil count was already present (1,300▁eosinophils/μL).
Physical examination The patient was in good general condition, conscious, oriented, well hydrated and perfused, afflicted and eupneic at rest.
Peripheral lymphadenopathy was not present.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation showed no abnormalities.
The abdomen was painless, with no masses or organomegaly.
There were no dermal lesions.
The lower limbs had no edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis, with preserved and symmetrical pulses.
▁Complementary laboratory tests showed a high absolute eosinophil count (with values of 1,780▁eosinophils/μL in November 2007 and 1,760/μL in December 2007).
The rest of the blood count was within normal limits.
The peripheral blood smear showed signs and symptoms without other findings.
General biochemistry, thyroid study and urine sediment were normal.
The study of autoantibodies (ANA, antimitochondral and smooth muscle) was negative, as well as the celiac profile.
Total IgE was high, 2,000 (normal: 0 -100 IU/L).
The requested serology (anticipated hepatitis B surface and antibodies against hepatitis C virus;▁Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-acquired virus, Toxoplasma and HIV) was negative.
Serum samples were sent to the National Center for Microbiology of Mahonda (Madrid) for serological study, resulting negative for liver Fasciola, Anisakis and Trypanosoma cruzi.
The abdominal CT scan showed patchy condensation areas in both lung bases without evident air bronchogram inside, axillary inflammatory lesion in the right lung, umbilical hernia, left coxofemoral prosthesis and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Upper endoscopy was normal and gastric and duodenal biopsy showed mild chronic gastritis.
Detection of stools was negative.
Diagnostic tests Serological determinations were made for IgG against acryloides 2.47 (high positive) and IgG serology against Toxo 1.22 (high positive).
Clinical judgements Cryptic eosinophilia.
Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Probable Mixed Crediting by Ceyloid stercoralis and Cough
Ev.▁~~~ Recipient received treatment withbendazole (400 mg vo./12 hours) and ivermec type (two days), with good tolerance.
After the end of treatment, the patient is asymptomatic, with disappearance of pruritus, and in the subsequent analytical control the absolute eosinophil count decreased to 180/μL.
