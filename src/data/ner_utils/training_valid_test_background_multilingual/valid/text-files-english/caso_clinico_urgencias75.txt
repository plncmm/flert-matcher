associated colitis.
The patient was seen in the emergency department three times until hospital admission.
1st visit: fever of 4 days of evolution migratory joint pains, generalized myalgias and a pruritic internal supramaleolar lesion attributed by the patient to a sting.
Location: TA 169/78, FC 78, Ta 36.4 oxygen saturation 98%.
Physical examination normal.
No lymphadenopathies.
On the left lower extremity: a 1 cm pustular lesion with reddish edges, painless or suppurative with erythema in the perilesional area, without other lesions.
▁Complementary tests: leukocytes 11,890, rest normal (BC count, blood-orina biochemistry and chest X-ray).
Diagnosis: colitis.
Initial treatment: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
2nd visit: On the 3rd day of treatment initiation, the patient returned to the emergency department due to persistent fever, skin lesions on the trunk and proximal area of the extremities with inguinal and submaxillary painful lymphadenopathies.
Location: TA 158/75, HR 82, Ta 38.5, oxygen saturation 99%.
Physical examination showed no changes except for progression of skin lesions.
P. complementary: normal.
Serology and culture were requested from the emergency department.
The patient usually works in the field, in contact with waters of canals and pantanus, so zoonosis is suspected.
Dexketoprofen was added and discharged home.
3rd visit: 8 days after the onset of skin lesions progression and fever persistence.
The normal physical examination revealed inguinal and submandibular lymphadenopathy with suppuration remnants and ulcerated on the surface.
Analytical: SGA 120, 14,400 leukocytes; negative serology and microbiological cultures.
Differential diagnosis in the emergency department initially infectious: follicosis for a specific purpose; and conjunctivitis or complicated colitis; ulcers caused by leishmania, mycobacteria, or deep mycoses.
Less frequent: late syphilis or herpes infections, which can cause suppurative ulcers.
Skin▁neoplasms or vascular ulcers
Treatment failure: clinical progression and treatment failure.
Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid was maintained in the plant, with no progression of skin lesions.
Nine fever peaks during admission and extension of the skin, so intravenous corticoids were started and▁dermatology consultation was performed due to suspicion of pyoderma ureterorenous lesions.
The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of pyoderma and the systemic symptoms disappeared.
