A 24-month-old girl with recurrent episodes of generalized evanescent habonose lesions and angioedema in hands and face, resistant to conventional treatment (antihistamines and corticosteroids).
No residual macules.
No other symptoms.
No apparent relationship with food or drugs.
On physical examination, angioedema was observed in hands and knee wheals.
The study was negative or normal for: Prick-test with food screening (cereals, nuts, legumes, fruits, cow's milk, egg white blood cell count, thyroid epithelium, fish, yellowish skin profile),
IgE to aeroalleral agents (Olivo, Gramineae, dog-cat epithelium) and food (leche-vaca, egg, legumes, mecovirus, and gluten).
Conclusions: The most common cause of burns was burns.
However, the anti-transglutaminase, anti-endomysium and anti-gliadin IgA antibodies were positive.
A celiac disease-associated HLA study was requested, with positive results in the serotypes DR7-DQ2 and DR3-DQ2.
The results indicated a gluten diet.
Reviews showed clinical improvement, demonstrating isolated episode of urticaria in two transgress diets.
The patient was sent to the gastroenterology department for biopsy.
Chronic urticaria was diagnosed as the onset of celiac disease.
We report a case of urticaria as a debut of celiac disease without digestive symptoms, of interest because it is a rare association.
