Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Episode of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower limb.
Usual treatment: torasemide 10 mg (1-0-0), valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 160/12,5 mg (1-0-0), simvastatin 10 mg (0-0-1), metformin 850 mg (0-1-0), doxium 500
Current disease The patient is admitted from the Emergency Department due to slowly progressive dyspnea for approximately two months, until minimal exertion is made, along with oliguria and lower limb edema.
One week ago, the patient presented with a catarrhal episode consisting of nasal congestion, cough and whitish sputum, which is why he came to his health center with amoxicillin 8725 week ago, increasing empirical diuretic and instaurant treatment.
The patient presented poor improvement after 5 days of treatment.
Physical setting AT 160 mmHg, FC 71 bpm, SatO2 92 % with room air, Ta 36.7°C.
Aware and oriented in time and place.
"I confess."
Good hydrated, good peripheral perfusion.
She had tachypnea at rest, with no signs of respiratory work.
Ultimate jugular venous pressure was not evaluable.
CA: cardiac tones apagated without auscultation clear murmurs.
PA: crackles in both bases.
Globulous abdomen, depressible, without tenderness to palpation.
Extremities with edema of the fovea up to the root of the thighs, signs of chronic venous insufficiency.
COMPLEMENTARY PRUES ECG: atypical atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response at 75 bpm.
BRDHH with secondary alterations of repolarization.
Blood analysis at admission: glucose 92 mg/dl, urea 60 mg/dl, creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, albumin 3.76 g/dl, liver function normal, sodium 145 mmol/l, potassium 0.61 mg^ml, platelet count 52,83/dl
Chest radiography: no cardiomegaly.
Pleural effusion was bilateral.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV non-dilated, hypertrophic, with good global and segmental systolic function.
The mitral valve was slightly calcified with a ring and mild mitral regurgitation was mild.
Aortic arch not.
Thickened aortic valve with an image of intermediate echogenicity cannot be ruled out with endothetic involvement, with maximum and mean gradients of 50 and 26 mmHg, respectively.
Moderate-severe FI.
TEE is recommended for a better evaluation of these findings.
Moderately fixed AI
▁Right cavities non-contrast, RV with good function.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation with a Vd-d gradient of 34 mmHg.
The estimated MAP was 40 mmHg.
No pericardial effusion.
Transesophageal echocardiogram: aortic valve thickened with calcifying points, presents a severe regurgitation (IV/IV) with image compatible with perforation at the level of the non-coronary velum.
Small mobile image in the LVOT somewhat hyperechogenic 0.7 x 0.3 cm dependent on this velum.
Mild mitral regurgitation without pathological images.
EVOLUTION During his stay in the hospital ward, intravenous depletive treatment is established with slowly progressive improvement of congestive signs.
A first episode of heart failure was diagnosed, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, followed by transesophageal echocardiography with the findings described, consistent with endocarditis.
The Infectious Diseases Service was contacted for interdisciplinary assessment of the condition.
In spite of the atypical clinical picture, panbacterial PCR was requested, as well as hemocultive and urocultive, empirical treatment was adjusted for possible endocarditis (ampicillin + cloxacillin + renal function in previous study).
During the following days, the cultures collected (positive, aesthetic and urocultive valve) were negative and, despite an increase in diuretic treatment, the patient recorded a significant case of venous prosthesis with unfavorable progression of cardiac valve edema due to aortic valves.
Among the laboratory tests requested, serology for Coxiella burnetti was positive, with high titers, allowing the diagnosis of endocarditis due to Q fever, so that the regimen of high-hydroxyquine treatment was modified starting with the administration of
During the months after discharge, the patient presented several episodes of inclusion of bilateral pleural effusion due to cardiac insufficiency, which has required educational measures and monitoring of infectious diseases and outpatients, being periodic outpatients and outpatients with chronic venous insufficiency.
DIAGNOSIS Endocrinitis due to Q fever on aortic valve.
Aortic insufficiency due to non-coronary aortic leaflet perforation.
Secondary congestive heart failure.
Aortic valve replacement surgery with a biological prosthesis.
