We report the case of a 48-year-old, independent male (Barthel 100-EC 1) with schizoaffective disorder in follow-up for mental health and treatment with corticosteroids and olanzapine as the only medical history.
She presented with fever, weakness and generalized tremor of 48 hours duration.
Their relatives reported confusion and stupor at home.
The patient presented with upper respiratory tract symptoms and odynophagia, without other symptoms.
The initial physical examination only showed a tendency to hypertension and tachycardia, with a febricula of 37.8oC.
Anonymous exploration.
Blood tests were performed to detect acute phase reactants leukocytes, 82% neutrophils, C-reactive protein 35.7, procalcitonin, and 23491 signs of non-acute renal failure (CPK) with 23491 episodes.
In addition, a chest X-ray was requested, which was normal, and a CT scan of the skull showed no pathological findings.
Initially, respiratory origin of the fever was established.
Treatment with serotherapy and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone was started, but the patient presented a rapid clinical worsening, persisting with fever up to 41oC, tachycardia, sweating and tremor and significant generalized stiffness.
At this time, a differential diagnosis is proposed, ranging from infection in the central nervous system to pharmacological origin of the condition, including neuromalignant syndrome.
It was decided to perform lumbar puncture, in which data compatible with meningoencephalitis of probable bacterial origin were observed (turbine liquid, 1500 cells, 75% polymorphonuclear, decreased glucose, vancomycin and lactate increased antibiotic coverage).
Finally, DNA was detected from Lys anomaly in cerebrospinal fluid.
The patient has a torpid initial evolution, with prolonged admission to intensive care and need for timely dialysis, but progressive final improvement.
In this case, infection stands out as a non-traumatic cause of rablysis, which if not diagnosed early can cause acute renal failure.
There are several cases described in the literature that associate meningoencephalitis due to Lys anomaly and rablysis due to direct invasion of myocytes.
This microorganism has been shown to have a higher incidence than other etiologic agents in this condition.
