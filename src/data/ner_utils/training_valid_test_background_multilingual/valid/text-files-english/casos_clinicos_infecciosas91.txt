We report the case of a 71-year-old patient who came to the emergency department for altered language emission accompanied by headache with oppressive characteristics, altered sensitivity in the perioral region and signs of force loss in other regions.
This is a patient with an active and independent life for basic activities of daily living as well as excellent cognitive level.
His medical history included high blood pressure with good control with an antihypertensive drug, heavy smoking habit until 35 years of age (ICAT 50 packs/year) with no alcohol habit and lung lesions caused by direct contact with asbestos for his work.
She was operated on for basal cell carcinoma of the scalp and left inguinal hernia.
The patient was specifically questioned about symptoms related to the possible constitutional picture he had not presented, and epidemiological history of interest, denying contact with animals, recent travels, transfusions and risky sexual practices.
Upon examination, the patient is in good general condition, conscious, oriented and cooperative, well hydrated and perfused.
except for a well-known fine blood pressure (AT) 130 mmHg, eupneic at rest at 12 bpm, maintaining oxygen saturation of 98% breathing in room air, rhythmic at 70 bpm, with normal auscultation cardiorespiratory
Examination by systems and systems did not reveal findings in the head and neck, abdomen depredictable, painless to inferior fixation, peritonism or defenseless lesions, with discrete cutaneous findings showing hepatomegaly in limbs 1-2.
Neurological examination revealed bradylalia but no dysphasia or dysarthria were detected; left supranuclear facial paralysis with the rest of the cranial nerves without alterations; and a decrease in the upper muscle strength of the left limb 4/5.
Initial laboratory studies revealed a slight transaminase (GOT 61 U/l, GPT 41 U/l) with normal parameters (glycemia, creatinine, urea, blood clotting, elevation of bilirubin).
The chest X-ray showed signs compatible with chronic bronchopathy and the electrocardiogram showed no alterations of interest.
Urgent skull computed tomography (CT) was performed, highlighting a space occupying lesion (SLO) in the right frontal region, round and hypodense 12 mm with no contrast-enhancement of any other lesions.
Clinical findings and isolation were decided to admit the patient to the Internal Medicine department to complete the study.
Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of cerebral LOE with ring contrast uptake should include a series of clinical pictures that can mainly be divided into 4 etiological groups: 1.
Tumor: primary central nervous system (CNS)▁neoplasms and metastases from other primary tumors.
• Metastases are the most common tumors of the CNS in adults, lung cancer being the primary metastasis most frequently followed by breast, colorectal and melanoma.
They are iso- or hypointense lesions in T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences, characterized by the formation of a large amount of vasogenic edema and heterogeneous contrast uptake in a variable pattern (primary necrosis).
• Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary intracranial neoplasm in adults, of heterogeneous appearance, hyperintense on T2-weighted images with vasogenic edema surrounding the lesion and enhancement after contrast administration.
• Primary brain lymphoma, a variant of non-homogeneous peripheral Hodgkins lymphoma, usually appears as an isocompetent individual with a differentiated behavior according to the patients immunocompetence, with a thick enhancement.
2.
Infectious: pyogenic abscesses, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cerebral tuberculosis infection (TB) and neurocysticercosis were the most prevalent.
• Toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection of the CNS that occurs especially in immunocompromised patients presenting as usually multiple lesions although they can be single, with hypodense center and prominent edges with enhancement ring, if they can appear well.
• Central nervous system tuberculoma is an uncommon form of infection in patients with tuberculosis and occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients; they usually present as single lesions, of variable size, usually located around the frontal and parietal lobes.
• Neurocysticercosis in its initial stage, noncystic, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis since it can be seen as a localized focus of edema with ring-enhancement after proper administration of contrast.
• Brain abscesses are parenchymal infections that can occur due to contiguity of pericraneal focus (on sinus trauma, sinusitis, infection by secondary dissemination or infection from a distal focus.
The etiology depends on these foci, being Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus the most frequently involved microorganisms.
The level of immunocompetence of the patient should be taken into account, germs involved Liccidia spp., the possibility of fungal infections,▁coccidioidomycosis, histolytic spp. and Mucor Salmonella spp. should also be considered.
Abscesses are usually seen as lesions (frontal and parietal lobes) according to the phase in which the abscess is located (most early uptake, late contrast), usually manifesting as a capsule late formation (late capsule),
3.
Impregnant mental illness: highlighting multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelinating disease characterized by perivenous inflammation, demyelination and gliosis.
It is characterized by solitary or multiple lesions with edema and inflammation that capture contrast in the form of an incomplete ring or in the form of a horseshoe to the gray matter.
4.
Vascular: acute cerebral ischemia presents as a hyperintense lesion in T2 with ring-enhancement after contrast administration, being of paramount importance the study of tissue perfusion in acute cases to detect areas of penu.
In our case, given the patient's symptoms and personal history, we focused on tumor and infectious causes, ruling out inflammatory and vascular conditions.
a Underlying right ventricular apex beat, admission was decided to complete the study initiated in the area of the left ventricle with a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that confirmed the presence of a rounded right frontoparietal lesion with a 3 cm diameter
The lesion showed hypointense signal on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequences with fine-ringed, uniform and complete enhancement after gadolinium administration, with marked restriction suggestive of brain abscess.
Parallel to this, a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of malignancy, ruled out tumoral lesions, although it showed other findings with chronic liver disease, slightly increased portal caliber (17 mm) and moderate portal vein obstruction (17 cm).
In the complete blood analysis requested at admission, which included being for HIV, HBV, HCV and Toxo, mild coagulopathy was detected in the complex for HIV, HBV prothrombin complex, while viral hepatitis HBV was detected as viral load/micro.
These findings suggested brain abscess as the first diagnostic possibility in patients with chronic HCV infection not previously known.
Hemocultives were extracted without evidence of bacteremia due to fever and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was requested to rule out cardiac origin, which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction, ruling out vegetation.
Because of the microbiological evidence, it was decided to modify antibiotic therapy with ampicillin associated with gentamicin for 6 weeks (at this time, in treatment with ceftriaxone, metronidazole and ampicillin).
Neurologically, the patient developed worsening of the clinical condition without removing the abscess later, after commenting on the case with the Neurosurgery Department, aspirating the patient and instilling serum with antibiotics through ultrasound control that caused hemorrhagic capsule.
Samples were sent to pathology and microbiology (bacteria, mycobacterial slow growth, antimicrobial agents and fungicides) growing in the abscess culture Li detected only in the same profile.
From the neurological point of view, the patient presented good clinical evolution with complete recovery after the intervention.
As a complication, the patient developed episodes of hyperglycemia during hospitalization that required insulin control, and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus in relation to chronic liver disease.
Regarding HCV infection, the patient was re-interrupted about possible transmission routes, probably related to blood transfusion in childhood.
Viral genotype 1b was detected and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The patient showed no focal lesions, portal hypertension and liver enlargement. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no small esophageal varices.
No data on hepatic encephalopathy or renal damage.
In the context of infection, the patient did not present a new episode of hidropic ascites and edema in the lower limbs or genitals, requiring paracentesis evacuadora (drainage of 8 L subsequent liquids).
A positive▁cryoglobulinemia study was requested, as well as negative autoimmunity.
CHILD B6 was calculated with the previous data and it was decided to start treatment with sobuvir/velpatasvir one tablet daily.
During admission, the patient developed acute tubular necrosis and gentamicin had to be withdrawn. It was decided to discontinue therapy with anticoagulants (not requiring antiviral therapy); modification to glecaprevir/pibrenta).
The evolution has been favorable in external consultations, decided not to mention that evident improvement of the cerebral abscess in the control MR after completion of antibiotic therapy, although with persistence of perilesional edema it was decided to prolong the removal of the capsule 4 weeks.
In subsequent follow-up, brain image has been completely resolved.
Final diagnosis • Frontal abscess due to sepsis associated with bacteremia in a patient with unknown chronic HCV infection.
• Hepatic cyroses CHILD B6 HCV genotype 1B with first fixation hydropic, portal hypertension, enlarged spleen, small esophageal varices and▁cryoglobulinemia.
• Unknown type 2 diabetes mellitus.
