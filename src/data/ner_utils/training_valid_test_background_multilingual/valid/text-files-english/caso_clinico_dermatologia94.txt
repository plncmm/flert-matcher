Anamnesis We present the cases of a 54-year-old man with no relevant pathological history who came to the consultation in August due to the appearance of pigmented lesions on the dorsum of the hands and forearm 7 and 10 days.
The lesions were asymptomatic and at first had been erythematous.
Physical examination revealed a mottled pigmentation along with pigmented spotted lesions on forearms and backs of hands, especially in the area of the anatomical block.
There were similar lesions in the abdomen and thighs, with the same pattern of mottled hyperpigmentation and linear morphology, which coincided with the area of the pants.
Additional information not required.
Diagnosis Given the distribution and characteristics of the lesions and the period of the year, questions were asked about the preparation of motorcycles in the weeks prior to the appearance of the lesions, with the affirmative answer.
These data led to the diagnosis of a phytophotoderma induced by allergic contact dermatitis (dorsal acropigmentation due to mojites).
Treatment The treatment consisted of informing the patient about the origin and safety of the condition and adequate photoprotection.
The evolution of the lesions was satisfactory, since almost all of them had improved, with post-inflammatory hypopigmentation appearing in some areas at 4 weeks.
