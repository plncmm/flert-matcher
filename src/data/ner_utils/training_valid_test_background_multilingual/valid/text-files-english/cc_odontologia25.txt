A 21-year-old healthy male patient presented with LDT when falling from a bicycle; with complicated coronary fracture of the teeth: 12, 11 and 21, with a 48-hour evolution.
Due to the evolution of two days since the accident, the patient presents pain and inflammation to the extraoral examination, during the intraoral examination is observed pulp exposure of the teeth involved and indicates the urgent treatment to be followed, to decrease inflammation.
Emergency treatment consisted of removal of dental fragments to have a better view of the area and possible treatment to be performed.
It was performed under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, then pulpectomy of teeth 12, 11 and 21 was performed leaving a 35% calcium hydroxide medication as temporary iondentomer with 12.5 xS ultradentomer.
Diagnosis Gingival smile patient who presents complicated crown fracture of tooth 21 in the middle third of the crown and tooth 12 in the cervical third, complicated crown and root fracture of tooth 11; gingivitis induced by dentobacterial plaque tooth 15, teeth
▁Periodontal Phase I treatment plan Interconsultation with the Orthodontics Department to direct the treatment in an interdisciplinary way, performing alignment of tooth 13 and orthodontic extrusion of teeth that suffered TDI.
Crown lengthening for endodontic and restorative purposes with a 15c scalpel blade, an internal bevel incision is made and then an intrasurcal structure to eliminate a flap raised total thickness.
Measurements are made with a periodontal probe to determine the amount of bone tissue to be eliminated with osteotomy and osteoplasty to ensure the splint effect necessary for provisional restorations.
It is measured with the probe to ensure an osteotomy of at least 3 mm. It is then sutured with simple stitches.
In the clinical history, the patient revealed that his upper central attachments had diastemas. During the same surgery, the upper labial frenum was released by frenilectomy, since his upper labial frenum was removed.
Treatment of root canal system Healed crown elongation surgery, had a greater dental structure, which facilitates and ensures the isolation to conform the canals with vertical root canal filling with Slexchild® sodium balance.
Yellow reaction (3 with glass fiber posts With absolute isolation, clearance is performed with Schilder's vertical compaction instruments, and postprandial ESP® post-glass radiographs are taken.
The cement was filled with resin cement. 37% x-ray washed with water spray and dried with paper points. The cementation of the glass endopost was made with a long glass cement system.
Cementation of provisional teeth KetacTM Cem (3M ESPE) glass ionomer was cemented and sent to orthodontic treatment.
▁Periodontal control during the beginning of orthodontic treatment The patient was cited to perform personal plaque control and give indications of brushing with the current orthodontic appliance.
During this follow-up appointment, dentoalveolar radiographs are performed, in which a root resorption is observed. This can be attributed to an infl ammatory response to periodontal ligament injuries or movements in response to periodontal trauma.
