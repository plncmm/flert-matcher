Anamnesis We report the case of a 78-year-old male with the following personal history: hypertension; tachycardia- bradycardia syndrome; ischemic heart disease; chronic hepatitis C; adenocarcinoma of moderate renal adenocarcinoma with Gleason score of 76 mg/ Gy in 2006.
During follow-up for liver disease, an abdominal non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed on December 30, 2009, a left renal mass of 4 cm in diameter suggestive of renal tumor was observed.
Physical location Abdomen: blando, depressible, non-sickening masses or enlargement.
Physical examination was normal.
▁Complementary tests • abdominal-pelvic CT: a solid interpolar lesion of the left kidney was observed, compatible with a neoformation as the first possibility of 4 cm in diameter.
In addition, lesions occupying nonspecific hepatic space were observed.
Treatment Primer surgical procedure: on February 10, 2010, a left partial nephrectomy was performed by lumbotomy approach.
Anatomopathological diagnosis: clear cell renal carcinoma of 4 x 2.5 x 3 cm, Fuhrman grade IV, located in the capsule and perirenal adipose tissue that greatly affects the surgical margin (pathological stage).
Second surgical procedure: due to the presence of poor histological profile of the specimen and positive broad surgical margins, it was decided to complete nephrectomy on May 10, 2010.
Anatomopathological diagnosis: no evidence of congenital malformation.
Postumorectomy inflammatory changes and recurrence.
a Cell-in-laden solid tissue abdominopelvic from June 27, 2011 shows a mass with ill-defined contours in the left lumbar abdominal wall, with adjacent fat trabeculation and pseudoaneous images.
A biopsy of this mass was performed on July 8, 2011, confirming in the histopathological study tumor cells compatible with recurrence of clear cell carcinoma.
Third surgical procedure: on 5/9/2011 excision of local recurrence was performed by lumbotomy approach.
Anatomopathological diagnosis: 11 x 8 cm mass due to clear cell carcinoma.
Current state: the last CT scan performed on October 8, 2012 showed no signs of local recurrence or distant disease.
His last creatinine figure is 2.56 mg/dl.
