A 54-year-old patient who came to the clinic due to an increase in PSA levels, antibiotic treatment was recommended and further analysis was performed.
After a result of 8 ng/ml, a prostatic biopsy was recommended.
The pathological result was prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason 3+3= 6, confirming localized disease with a nuclear magnetic resonance.
She had a history of prior surgery for ablanchectomy and inguinal herniorrhaphy.
Surgical treatment was proposed by radical prostatectomy, with the retropump approach and extraperitoneal approach using the Walsh technique, and the procedure was uneventful.
During the first days, the patient presented fever peaks of up to 38.1oC, symptoms of postoperative paralytic ileus with abundant vomiting on the second day, and oral tolerance was suspended starting on the first day.
On the fourth day, an abdominal X-ray was performed with the presence of gas in the colon and air-fluid levels in the right colon.
The patient was discharged on the eighth day due to a satisfactory evolution.
On the seventh day, the patient presented with right flank pain and redness of the area with fever up to 39oC.
Abdominal CT showed a liquid collection with abundant gas located behind the second and third duodenal portions accompanied by minimal pneumoperitoneum. Retroperitoneal perforation was suspected when the descending colon was found, opting for a conservative approach.
Drainage was placed in the collection by ultrasound, obtaining cultures of liquid, with growth of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Candida albicans within days.
During admission, she received empirical antibiotic treatment based on cultures.
A nasogastric tube was placed and oral feeding was suspected parenterally.
The collection was monitored by ultrasound, confirming the intestinal clicking with contrast in a gastroduodenal transit 30 days after the placement of the drainage, subsequently starting oral tolerance.
After good tolerance to food intake and apyretic status, a drainage tube was removed and the patient was discharged 45 days after the intervention.
At 26 months she remains asymptomatic and with undetectable PSA.
