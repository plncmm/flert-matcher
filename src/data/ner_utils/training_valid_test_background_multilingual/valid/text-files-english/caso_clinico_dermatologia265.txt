Anamnesis A 52-year-old patient of Paraguayan origin with no history of interest came to consultation of facial dysmorphia for presenting for several years a non-pruritic hyperpigmented lesion in the external region treated with left ankle.
The patient describes it as a "hematem", although he does not remember having ever hit the area.
Six months ago, a similar, smaller lesion was noticed in the contralateral limb.
Physical examination revealed a large brownish brownish macule with blistery areas that did not bleach at vitropression on the outer side of the left ankle.
On the dorsum of the contrateral foot, the macula was similar but smaller.
▁Complementary tests An increase in vascular spaces of irregular morphology covered by flattened endothelial cells, arranged in the entire thickness of the dermis, was observed in the dermatopathological study of a 4 mm punch biopsy.
These vascular spaces were arranged dissecting collagen fibers and vascular structures predetermined.
The▁immunohistochemical study showed positivity for D2 and the presence of HHV8 virus could be demonstrated by nuclear positivity for LNA-1 in endothelial cells.
Serology for HIV and hepatotropic virus was negative.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was also performed to rule out internal organ involvement, which only revealed kidney stones and gallstones, as well as a granuloma in the left lower pulmonary lobe.
Diagnosis Given the result of the dermatopathologic study, which described the lesion as a proliferation of lymphatic endothelial origin and positivity for HHV8 established the diagnosis of classic Kaposi's sarcoma.
Treatment Taking into account the location of the lesions and the absence of symptoms the different therapeutic options were explained, finally opting for expectant attitude and close clinical follow-up.
Ev. After twelve months of follow-up there has been no progression of the clinical picture and the patient remains asymptomatic.
