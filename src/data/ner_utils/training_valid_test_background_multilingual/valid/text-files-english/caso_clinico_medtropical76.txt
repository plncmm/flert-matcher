A 56-year-old male farmer from Tarapoto, San Martin Region, Peru.
She had been suffering from ventral wrist pain for eight years.
He complained of pruritus and stabbing pain.
He had self-medicated with sugary creams without visible improvement, presenting healing in the oldest part of the lesion.
Cromoblastosis by Hycaearosoi: erythematous-squamous lesion; café au lait spot; central colony-like lesions with tapered tapering of the bladder (400 enlargements tabs).
Direct examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) revealed the presence of muriform or coffee-coloured smoke cells with a central septum typical of▁chromoblastomycosis.
Cultures showed 7 mm colonies at 10 days of age, slow growing, hairy, limited and black, compatible with a bleaching worm.
The subsequent study, using the microcultivation technique and Zisen-Neel coloration interposed for hyphae characterization and with hyphae, identified the characterization of phygides and pedrosoi.
Laboratory tests performed on the patient showed negative serology for HIV, hematocrit 45%, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, leukocyte count 7.800 cé/mm3 and ̄s ̄s ̄s ̄
Antifungal treatment with itraconazole 100 mg every 12 h for one month was initiated; however, the patient did not return to his control and abandoned medical treatment, losing the possibility of observing the clinical evolution.
