A 7-year-old male patient with a history of atopic dermatitis presented with urticaria and angioneurotic oedema after ingestion of a torticollis and fish at 12 months.
At 3 years: IgE 360IU/ml, Ovomucoid 1.61kU/L, Clara 14.5kU/L, Ovalbumin 15.61kU/L, Bacalao 10.4kU/L
Prick > 3 Clara, Ovomucoid and Ovalbumin.
Negative cooked egg oral challenge test (PPO) indicated a diet containing cooked eggs 3 times a week and fish.
After ingestion of Melon, the patient reported urticaria. Prick was performed: LTP 5/6, Prophylin 0/6, Clara 8/6, Yema 5/6, Huevo 2/6, Ovoalbumin 10/6, Merluoid
IgE 404 IU/ml, Ovomucoid 0.83kU/L, Clara 8.95kU/L, Ovalbumin 8.62kU/L, Yema 1.59kU/L, Gallo 3.51
PPO is practiced to treat what is positive, indicating diet with cooked eggs, melanomaon and fish.
At 7 years of age, the patient presents food impaction, undergoes endoscopic gastroenteric lithiasis and presents a score > 40 (eos/hpf).
Fluticasone deglutide 250mcg BID + Omeprazole is prescribed, diet consisting of eggs, fish and Mel√≥n.
The present case could suggest the involvement of EoE with the reintroduction of allergic foods, so close monitoring of patients consuming allergenic foods after an ILO is recommended.
