Anamnesis A 47-year-old Caucasian male, nuclear power stations technician as a profession, married, living with his wife, and is independent for basic activities of daily living.
He is a smoker of half a pack of ruby tobacco (10 cigarettes) from 16 years to the time of diagnosis (47 years), with a pack-year index (API) of approximately 15.
She has a chronic deafness of the ear and has undergone surgery for right atrial fibrillation and cystectomy.
She has no known allergies and does not receive any pharmacological treatment.
No family history of interest.
The patient started in December 2011 with cough and dyspnea, with initial suspicion of respiratory infection, which is why antibiotic treatment was initiated.
Medical emergencies attended the emergency department in February 2012.
The patient is in good general condition, Eastern Cooperative Group Oncology (EC) 1 scale, normal physical signs and right basal hypoventilation on examination, with no other relevant findings.
▁Complementary tests In the chest X-ray performed in the emergency room, a right pleural effusion was observed, and she was admitted to Internal Medicine for further study.
cytokeratin and pleural biopsies showed morphological and▁immunohistochemical data (IHC) compatible with adenocarcinoma, and the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) was positive.
At molecular level, no mutations were found in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of EGFR.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a nodular right appearance occupying solidly the angle of the right sinus, bilateral pulmonary nodules and pleural effusion already known.
In addition, videobronchoscopy with biopsy was performed to complete the molecular study, without finding ALK rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).
Diagnosis With the diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer (TxNxM1), with no mutations in EGFR and K, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lung in the outpatient clinic of an outpatient setting for medical advice.
Treatment In March 2012, the first line chemotherapy treatment was initiated with a plateau AUC-5 scheme and pemetrexed 500 mg every 21 days, with the addition of prior video-assisted▁bronchoscopy starting at 7.5 mg/kg starting from the second cycle, with non-in
It completed 4 cycles in May, with good clinical tolerance and partial response of the disease.
Subsequently, in June, maintenance treatment was started with pemetrexed and beizumab.
The patient visited the emergency room in July 2014, with a worse response to treatment, with greater prolongation of side effects such as asthenia, headache or joint pain.
For this reason, after 36 cycles (with progression-free interval [PLI] of 27 months from the start of chemotherapy and 24 months from the start of maintenance), pemetrex be administered and treatment with indinavir is continued.
In December 2014, in the absence of significant radiological disease and after assessing the risks and benefits, betaizumab and monotherapy were suspended (ILP from 32 months of chemotherapy, ILP from the start of maintenance of 29 months beclomethicillin I).
Due to the evolution of the ROS patient, this time continues to deepen in the molecular study on previous pleural biopsy, without finding BRAF mutations, KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61) and not METable,
During the follow-up, in April 2015 CT scan, a lesion appeared in the base of the right hemithorax with liquid content. In the previous study, a guided needle aspiration was not observed, but only 1-2 ml was considered impossible.
For these reasons, due to the lack of evidence of disease, it was decided to continue follow-up, until a new CT scan of August 2015 showed a solid pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe of 9 mm in diameter, finding the right pleural lesion stable.
PET-CT was requested with high suspicion of progression. Mediastinal uptake and right posterior basal uptake were also assessed.
After a 41-month ILP and 8-month treatment-free interval (ITL), it was decided, given the good response and the complete and free interval achieved, with pemet retreatment, with the same scheme excellent TCexplatinum December 2015
It continues with subsequent maintenance with pemetrexed and betaizumab, which began in January 2016.
Having established the availability of the technique, in October 2016, a massive sequence of the disease is performed on the histological sample available for diagnosis, which shows fusion of EZR-ROS-1.
It was decided, given the good clinical tolerance and response achieved, to continue with maintenance, with removal of pemetrexed in December 2016 and therapeutic beizumab was not decided in March 2018, when the tumor was rest, CT.
A 12 mm subpleural nodule appears in a re-evaluation of May 2018, following a suspicious malignancy.
After a 31-month ILP and a 2-month ILT, upon progression, the patient is offered treatment initiation within a clinical trial with 600 mg of enctinib every 24 hours, with excellent tolerance and response.
After an accumulated survival of about 86 months (7 years approximately), the patient continues to be treated and has excellent quality of life.
