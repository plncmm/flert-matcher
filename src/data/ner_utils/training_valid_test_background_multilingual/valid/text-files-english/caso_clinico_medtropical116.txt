Personal history A thirty-year-old male, gadden, smoker of twenty cigarettes a day, without criteria of chronic bronchitis and social drinker.
He made a "mochilero" tourist trip with his partner for forty days in non-white Africa, visiting both urban and rural areas: Morocco, Sahara Ocua, Ma Guineauritania,
He received advice from travelers at the International Health Center, with chemoprophylaxis well tolerated with chloroquine.
He received tetravalent meningococcal vaccination, fever and typhoid.
He did not report specific risk behaviors during the trip except for baths in fresh water in Bamako.
Current illness 24 hours after the return, he came to the Emergency Department complaining of high fever, chills, cold symptoms and holocraneal headache.
After initial basic evaluation and no apparent source, the patient was discharged with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
He consulted again 24 hours later, due to persistent fever, holocraal headache, profane sweating, rhinoconjunctivitis and cough nonspecific.
Physical examination revealed blood pressure 100/60, heart rate 110 bpm, temperature 37.8oC, basal O2 saturation 98%, Glasgow score 15/15.
He was conscious and oriented, eupneic and well perfused, with small and elastic laterocervical lymphadenopathies and without painful craniofacial points.
Cardiopulmonary auscultation and abdominal examination were normal.
A mild erythematous macular rash on trunk and neck, with no petechial lesions (including a tourniquet test) was observed on the skin.
Neurological examination showed no meningeal signs or focality.
Additional leukocytes In the blood count showed a normal red blood cell series, about 3,360/ μL with relative neutrophilia, platelets of 58,000/μL.
Coagulation times were: prothrombin time 76%; normal activated partial thromboplastin time; fibrinogen 450 mg/dL.
Biochemistry showed normal glucose, creatinine and CPK levels.
GOT/GPT 140/176 U/L; LDH 691 U/L; CRP 12.24 mg/dL.
Venous gas showed pH 7.41, pCO2 34 mmHg, HCO3 16 mEq/dL.
Urine sediment showed proteinuria.
Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal.
The thick blood smear and the peripheral blood smear were negative, as well as the serial blood cultures.
Hepatitis A, B and C, Coxiella, Borrellia, Rickettsia, dengue and HIV serology was negative.
Diagnostic test Plasmodium falciparum was observed in the second thick blood smear (8 hours after the first one, at full fever peak), with a parasite index of 1%.
Clinical judgement Severe malaria complicated by Plasmodium falciparum.
Ceftriaxone 2/24 h was administered in hospitals and ceftriaxone 2/24 h was administered intravenously to all patients. Once Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed, the specific treatment was initiated.
Once the drug was obtained, treatment was initiated orally first and intravenously with slow infusion of quinine (10 mg/kg/8 hours) plus orally administered 100 mg/12 hours, compliant with seven days of treatment.
During the first 36 hours in the plant, the patient presented a poor clinical evolution, with the development of successive complications that required admission to the ICU on the second day: - Refractory hypoglycemia despite the administration of glucose solution at 20%.
- Parasitation of 12% on the third and fourth day, which together with other complications caused exchange transfusion.
- Early laboratory data on acute hepatic failure: prothrombin time 45%; bilirubin up to 6 mg/dL; AST/ ALT with values around 1200 U/L and decreased factor V.
- Severe anaemia (hepatitis pigmentosa <20% after 72 h), requiring transfusion of four solid concentrates
Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.31; HCO3 11), requiring aggressive management with fluid therapy under central venous pressure control, without requiring vasoactive drugs.
- Cognitive impairment with somnolence and ideomotor slowness with no other data on cerebral malaria from the second to the fifth day.
- Acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level at 5 days of 5.2 mg/dL and documented haemoglobinuria.
Urine output remained acceptable at all times and did not require renal replacement therapy.
- Intractable nausea and vomiting requiring enteral nutrition during the first four days.
- Interstitial infiltrate in the right upper lobe (although there is no evidence of respiratory failure, late development of respiratory distress was ruled out) and febrile rebound ciprofloxacin after 200 mg every 12 h empirical antibiotic coverage
After seven days in the ICU, treatment was completed with general clinical recovery, presenting at discharge renal failure, with creatinine levels around 3 mg/dL (MDRD 20 mL/min).
In subsequent follow-up in outpatient clinics, renal function has normalized.
