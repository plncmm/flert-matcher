Male patient, 68 years old, former operator of the textile industry, referred to consultation for complex renal cyst mass.
History of arthritis, controlled hypertension, dyslipidemia, pulmonary tuberculosis for 40 years, treated with indapamide, simvastatin, and NSAIDs included smoking habits or exposure to chemical agents.
She reported exposure to sheep in youth.
She had a known history of kidney stones.
She had undergone left hip replacement for years.
Abdominal or genitourinary ciruía.
She reported elimination of gelatinous material in the urine for months, without specific form, accompanied by episodes of total macroscopic hematuria, without clots.
No other accompanying symptoms such as back pain, nausea or vomiting, or lower urinary complaints
No anorexia, asthenia or weight decrease.
No respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient presented a non-painful▁crushing of the flank/left lumbar region.
No hepatomegaly, no abnormal abdominal collateral circulation.
Genital without clinical varicocele.
Lower limbs without edema.
No peripheral lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary auscultation showed no apparent changes.
Laboratory thermography showed mild anemia (Hb 12.7 g/dL), without leukocytosis.
Relative eosinophilia (2800/μL).
▁SV 67 mm.
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Urea 77 mg/dL.
An ultrasound revealed a right kidney with a slightly reduced size (10.8 cm) and increased echogenicity of the parenchyma, presenting a simple cyst in the upper pole.
The left kidney was a complex voicing cyst of the upper pole (70 x 68 x 67 mm), with evident solid content and regions associated with posterior acoustic shadowing.
Subjected to CAT scan, there was a non-field-pelvic - vesicular formation with complex cystic calcifications containing parietal and central groseras, occupying the upper two thirds of the kidney, and a thin House house with ten septa.
After contrast administration, it is evident that the contrast is captured by the walls.
No lesions of solid abdominal organs, presence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies or morphological alteration of the adrenal gland were evident.
Chest X-ray showed no significant alterations, such as cystic lesions or alterations compatible with metastatic lesions or active tuberculosis.
Mantoux (Tuberculin test) negative.
Search negative acid-fast bacilli.
Urine cultures (multiple samples) were negative on Lowenstein mean.
Serology for Echinococci granulosis and multilocularis negative.
With the diagnosis of complex cystic mass Bosniak class IV and in the absence of support for specific/parasitic infectious lesions, he underwent left radical nephrectomy by incision of lumbotomy on the bed of the 12th rib.
Anatomopathological examination showed a 11.5 cm larger tumor size, consisting of glands with simple and complex structure, with moderately differentiated epithelium and centered by mucoid material in the form of large "pools" mucin fragments.
The lesion is located in the renal parenchyma without affecting the capsule.
The remaining parenchyma showed signs of mild pyelonephritis.
Tumor-free surgical margins.
Conclusion: mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis PT3NxMx.
After obtaining the histological result, the patient was submitted to upper digestive endoscopy and endoscopy, which showed no abnormalities.
Follow-up was 10 months.
The patient is completely asymptomatic, with no evidence of disease recurrence, locally or distantly.
