Anamnesis A 46-year-old patient, born in Morocco, with no known drug allergies or relevant pathological history.
The patient was seen in the emergency department complaining of bite in the left lower limb. The patient reported that he had suffered a spider five days after the accident.
She had been evaluated by the primary care physician who indicated treatment with oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and clindamycin), despite which the lesion followed a torpid evolution with a marked increase in volume of necrotic limb and progressive increase in volume.
Physical examination revealed increased volume of the left thigh and an intensely inflammatory plaque of approximately 15 cm in diameter with a central necrotic stump of 3 x 2 cm.
Likewise, smaller inflammatory plaques were observed proximally following the lymphatic route.
▁Complementary laboratory tests showed C-reactive protein 12.6 mg/dL, leukocyte count 12,000/ml, neutrophil count 11,000/ml, platelet count 283,000/ml and hemoglobin 12.6 g/ml.
The remaining analytical parameters including creatinine, LDH, creatine kinase, electrolytes and coagulation were normal.
Microbiological culture of the ulcerated area of the lesion was negative.
Diagnosis Cutaneous loxoscelism due to spider bite of the genus Loxosceles rufescens.
Treatment A scarectomy was performed without complications and it was decided to be admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department where he underwent broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
The patient remained afflicted and with good general condition while on admission, although the cutaneous lesion manifested as a central ulceration and purulent▁exudate.
Two weeks later, the lesion progressed favorably, with a significant decrease in inflammation and▁exudate, so she was discharged.
Repeated microbiological cultures were performed during admission and were always negative.
The patient continued to be cured periodically for 6 weeks with complete resolution of the lesion.
