Patient with fulminant autoimmune hepatitis with right hemiparesis predominantly in the right upper limb of 1 day of evolution.
Additional verbal information is obtained after performing a cranial CT, the patient also has fever and severe neutropenia.
Cranial CT was performed without/with urgent VSD, observing multiple focal bilateral hypoplasia, extensive hypoplasia and asper-trichosis, asper-type, corticosubcortical junction lesions, with no significant mass effect that could be tuberculosis.
In urgent cranial MRI, bilateral and intraaxial expansive nodular lesions with low perilesional edema are confirmed.
In ipT2, they show a peripheral halo of signal loss, characteristic of fungal disease, with peripheral annular restriction and fine annular enhancement in contrast study.
A chest CT scan was also performed a few days later, which showed alveolar infiltrate with adjacent cavitation in the RLL, with thick and irregular walls, which made it necessary to rule out a cavity due to neoplasia, necrotizing pneumonia emphysema, abscess, pneumothorax, etc.
Final diagnosis: invasive cerebral and pulmonary aspergillosis.
